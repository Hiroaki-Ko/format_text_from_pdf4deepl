            "Acknowledgments When I was quite young I realized that I’d like to write a book. Back then, I had no idea what sort of book it would be, nor how I would go about figuring out what to write or how to write it. But I never gave up wanting to do it. After a good part of my life had already passed, I ended up in graduate school in philosophy, something else I always wanted to do. Still, though, the completion of such a project seemed far from my reach. It was enough just to get the degree. But as time passed and more and more work on parts of the project bore fruit, things changed. No longer was it just something I wanted to do; finally, it was done.\n",
            "\n",
            "My deepest debt is to Donald Ainslie, who, in supervising my doctoral thesis, was not only extraordinarily patient and generous with his time and knowledge, but also succeeded in bringing out the very best in me. His continued support as I moved from a student to a colleague has meant the world to me. My heartfelt thanks to Jennifer Nagel and Gideon Yaffe, who have been in my corner for a long time and who have been instrumental in so many of my professional achievements. I also owe very special mention to Jessica Gordon-Roth, who read and provided invaluable comments on the entire manuscript—some parts of it more than once. I can’t thank Jessica enough for being such a terrific interlocutor, not only because of her extensive knowledge of Locke’s philosophy, but also because of her collegiality and her friendship.\n",

            "Preface A good bit of work has been done on consciousness in Locke since I published my view in 2008, much of it in either partial or full agreement with that view. In this book, I extend my analysis of the role of consciousness in Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding to other areas of his philosophy, including his theories of knowledge, personal identity, and moral agency. Consciousness is a thread running through and helping to resolve tensions in many of the most important aspects of Locke’s philosophy. Incipient is a complete picture of the role of consciousness in Locke’s Essay.\n",
            "\n",
            "One theme will emerge as important to understanding the role consciousness plays in the Essay. Consciousness is self-consciousness. It is a non-evaluative selfreferential form of awareness internal to all perceptions of ideas. It is the perception that I am perceiving an idea, or the perception of myself as perceiving an idea. Thus, a central theme running through the book is that perceptions of ideas, for Locke, are complex mental states in which we are conscious of more than just the idea perceived. In any perception of an idea, there is, at the very least, an act of perception, an idea perceived, and consciousness (that I am perceiving). And not only is there a complexity involved in the way in which perceptions of ideas can be said to perform their representational function, but also there is a complexity in perceptions of ideas that results in knowledge and that results in both a synchronic and diachronic experience of the unity of consciousness. How consciousness as internal to a more complex mental state can be seen to contribute to different perceptual situations has significant import for understanding various aspects of Locke’s philosophy. Showing that significance is a primary task of the book.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here are just two ways, very briefly, in which this interpretation of consciousness plays out in Locke’s philosophy. First, consciousness as a constituent of a more complex mental state plays a significant role in constituting some agreements of ideas, the perception of which, for Locke, counts as knowledge. Importantly forLocke scholarship, once the complexity of our mental states is appreciated, we will see that Locke has no problem reconciling his general definition of knowledge as the perception of an agreement or disagreement of ideas with his claims that we have knowledge of particular things—of individual ideas, of our own existence, and of external world objects—all cases in which Locke seems to say that we perceive only one idea.\n",
            "\n",
            "A big advantage of the interpretation, then, is that I show not only how Locke can consistently claim that we have knowledge of particular things, but also that the complexity of our perceptual states makes possible the agreement perceived in each case. What results is a structurally integrated account of how, for Locke, we have knowledge of individual ideas, of ourselves, and of external objects. All three turn out\n",
            "\n",
            "xii\n",
            "\n",
            "to be cases of non-inferential knowledge. Moreover, the analysis is not unlike how, for Locke, we more standardly know general truths. Therefore, interpreting consciousness as internal to a more complex mental state plays an important role in Locke’s theory of knowledge.\n",
            "\n",
            "Second, because consciousness is self-consciousness and is a constituent of a more complex mental state, there can be an experience of the unity of consciousness in perceiving simultaneous and successive ideas. Moreover, when there are ideas in the mind simultaneously and there are agreements between those ideas, we will be conscious of those agreements. Along with its contribution to an analysis of how there can be a seamless experience of the mind’s manipulation of ideas resulting in more complex ideas or in having knowledge, consciousness as internal to each perception of an idea allows that in certain kinds of perceptual situations we can be aware of ourselves as temporally extended. Such an experience of a past and future self is crucial to Locke’s accounts of personal identity and moral agency. So, consciousness as internal to any perceptual state allows for the experience we have of our own thinking as consisting in a sophistication and complexity necessary for understanding aspects of Locke’s theory of knowledge, as well as of his theories of personal identity and moral agency, and resolving tensions in all three.\n",
            "\n",
            "As the book unfolds, it will become clear exactly how consciousness plays its role in various areas of Locke’s philosophy and how the interpretation helps to resolve problems therein. Interpreting consciousness and the functions it performs, as I have, goes beyond what Locke says explicitly in the Essay or elsewhere. This is not to say that there is not sufficient textual evidence in favor of the interpretation, and I have limited my arguments to those areas of Locke’s philosophy where he obviously considered consciousness to play a positive role. But because of the paucity of explanation by Locke concerning how he understood consciousness, I have had to fill out the story for him. I suspect that Locke, himself, was not quite sure of his own conception. Nevertheless, once the needed distinctions concerning the nature of consciousness and the work it does are drawn for him, we see that other troubling aspects of Locke’s philosophy fall into place. Indeed, by providing a consistent account of how consciousness fits neatly into Locke’s philosophical psychology, by showing how consciousness as a constituent of a more complex mental state leads to a structurally integrated account of our knowledge of particular things, by providing an interpretation of consciousness in the theory of personal identity that solves wellknown problems of transitivity, circularity, and sufficiency for Locke’s theological and moral concerns, and by providing a novel account of the nature of moral motivation, which provides for a robustness of agency needed and often lacking in causal theories of agency generally, I have gone much farther than any other interpretation of Locke on consciousness. In each case, I am making new and what I believe are important contributions to Locke scholarship. Of course, my claim is not that the interpretation of consciousness offered here solves all of Locke’s problems or that there might not be problems it cannot solve. I seek only to make Locke’s philosophy more coherent and\n",

            "\n",
            "In addition to lending internal coherence to Locke’s philosophy generally, another contribution of the interpretation is that Locke can be seen to be employing a notion of consciousness that is distinctively modern. As I read it, consciousness in Locke shares important similarities with later and contemporary phenomenological theories of consciousness as well as with recent developments in cognitive science that argue for a distinct aspect of mentality responsible for the conscious awareness of the sources of our mental states. I am not claiming that these similarities should be seen as justification for my interpretation. Rather, because of these similarities I see this interpretation of consciousness and its role in Locke’s philosophy as having more than antiquarian interest.\n",
            "\n",
            "After I historically situate the conception of consciousness I find in Locke in chapter one, I provide a much more detailed description of how that conception runs through other aspects of Locke’s philosophy. Nevertheless, a quick look at the book’s structure is in order. Chapter one sets the stage for seeing consciousness as a non-evaluative form of self-consciousness in Locke’s philosophical psychology. Early in the seventeenth century came the realization that not all forms of self-awareness are captured by the notion of conscience as an internal moral or evaluative awareness of oneself. By showing how some of Locke’s predecessors and contemporaries grappled with articulating this new kind of non-evaluative self-awareness, we can see how Locke himself might have seen the philosophical landscape and how he might have been influenced by what was going on around him. In this chapter, I am indebted to Catherine Glyn Davies’ (1990) and Udo Thiel’s (1994) work on Locke’s predecessors, which I discovered in 2005. It was primarily this early historical work by Thiel in addition to Mark Kulstad’s (1991) work on Locke that spurred my desire to find a consistent interpretation of consciousness in Locke (which I published in 2008) and to give an original account of its role in other aspects of his philosophy. In chapter two, I argue that Locke’s philosophical psychology includes a conception of consciousness as a special kind of reflexive awareness of ourselves internal to every act of perception. By distinguishing the consciousness of ourselves as thinking whenever we are thinking from other perceptual acts (primarily sensation and reflection), the interpretation is able to resolve a well-known tension in Locke’s model of the mind.\n",
            "\n",
            "Chapter three is organized somewhat unusually in that it is divided into three parts, each of which provides an analysis of the role consciousness plays in aspects of Locke’s theory of knowledge: in how we have knowledge of individual ideas and of our own existence (in part I) and in how we have “sensitive” knowledge of the existence of external world objects (in part II). In each case, I provide a symmetrical account of the perception of an idea as a complex mental state in which consciousness is a constituent and has a significant role to play in the achievement of knowledge. These two parts together provide a coherent, integrated account of how\n",

            "\n",
            "Moreover, the arguments in all three parts preserve consistency with all of Locke’s other commitments in his theory of knowledge. To my knowledge, there is currently no such account in Locke scholarship.\n",
            "\n",
            "One might notice that I am excluding from the analysis the case of knowing God’s existence, which is the only other knowledge of a particular we have. The reason is that, for Locke, this is a form of demonstrative knowledge, namely inferential knowledge by means of a rational proof. Despite what one may think of the cogency of Locke’s argument, it does not present the same potential threat to Locke’s commitments in his theory of knowledge generally as do these other cases of knowing individual things. What is needed and what I provide is an account of how we have knowledge of particular truths seemingly when we perceive only one idea. The solution is to be found in the complexity of our perceptual states and the constituent elements, including consciousness.\n",
            "\n",
            "Also in part III of chapter three, we see how Locke employs consciousness as an awareness of our own mental states to account for different perceptual situations constituting the different “degrees” of certainty of knowledge (intuitive, demonstrative, and sensitive) for which Locke is quite famous. Locke’s project in the Essay is to reveal the limits of human understanding by employing the “Historical, plain Method” (I.i.2) of providing a genetic account of knowledge beginning with what is manifest to us when we observe our own thinking. The fulcrum of Locke’s empiricism is the power of introspection to deliver a descriptive analysis of the nature of the mind and its activities without, however, delving into speculation about how ideas are produced either by the motions of bodies affecting our sense organs or in virtue of some sort of mind–body connection. Such a methodology, both emphasizing observation and confining analysis to the facts of experience, leads to an explanation of the role of consciousness in understanding how Locke could hold a representational theory of perception—that the immediate objects of perception are ideas—and that our knowledge of external world objects attains a degree of certainty deserving the name knowledge. To understand what he is up to, we can see Locke’s conception of the limits of knowledge as having two different strains according to two different perceptual situations: there is a psychological condition on knowledge and there is a normative condition on knowledge. Not only do we get a descriptive analysis of the different perceptual situations involved in perceiving agreements of ideas, and of the role Locke has consciousness play in helping to forge that difference, but also we get a normative understanding of how well the knowledge resulting from those perceptual situations stands up to a second-order consideration by virtue of the very same descriptive analysis. The ways in which the psychological condition and/or the normative condition are met determine the difference in degrees of certainty. We see this same distinction between perceptual situations having relevance also in Locke’s theory of personal identity.\n",
            "\n",
            "xv How Locke understands consciousness as the criterion for personal identity is the subject of chapter four. Much interpretive ink has been spilled trying to reconcile various aspects of Locke’s theory. Although I think some are more successful than others, none of them accounts for Locke’s metaphysical and moral commitments without also generating some sort of tension. In keeping with the interpretation of consciousness put forward in previous chapters, and differently from any other interpretation, I show how consciousness can be sufficient for personal identity without either tempting circularity, failing logical transitivity, or putting philosophical or textual pressure on other areas of Locke’s philosophy. Finally, in chapter five, I provide a fresh interpretation of Locke’s account of moral agency by showing how our freedom to engage in moral action is grounded in the fact that we are the kind of self-conscious beings we are. Included also is a novel interpretation of the motivation to suspend desire, which allows for a source of agency in ourselves that is always desired, but often missing, in causal theories of agency generally.\n",
            "\n",

            "More specifically, these words denoted a form of inner moral knowledge or an inner conviction with respect to a moral evaluation of one’s own thoughts and actions— what we more normally today associate with the English word ‘conscience.’3 During the middle decades of the seventeenth century the meaning changed again to include a non-evaluative knowledge of oneself. The OED cites uses of ‘consciousness’ and the adjective ‘conscious’ as early as 1620 to mean some sort of non-evaluative self-awareness,4 and with Descartes’ emphasis on an investigation of what we find in our own minds, the French ‘conscience’ underwent a similar shift in meaning.5\n",

            "meaning while Descartes (1642) and his immediate followers were struggling to do the same with the French ‘conscience.’8 Although Descartes seems not to have philosophically distinguished ‘conscience’ from ‘pensée’ (consciousness from thought), the Cartesian Louis de La Forge clears some ground by describing ‘conscience’ as involving a “sentiment intérieur,” which is distinguished both from the kind of thinking involved in sense perception as well as from the separate reflection we can make on our own thoughts.9 According to Catherine Glyn Davies (1990: 14), with La Forge, the Cartesian understanding of ‘conscience’ took on the meaning of immediate self-awareness that “is coexistent with all our experiences as thinking things, and is not to be confused with a bodily sensation or a species.” The new signification of the French ‘conscience’ suggested by La Forge can be seen as linking Descartes’ use of ‘conscience’ as a definition of thought with some of his most influential followers, especially Malebranche and Arnauld.10 For La Forge, “consciousness [in French, ‘conscience’] is not an idea, or an intuition, or a rational construction, but a sentiment.”11 The consciousness that “so intimately accompanies thought” is something entirely interior; it is felt, rather than known: Having examined all the various actions and passions of the mind and having considered what is found in each one of them in particular, and what they have in common, I think I can define the nature of thought as that consciousness, awareness and inner feeling by which the mind is aware of everything it does or suffers and, in general, of everything which takes place immediately in itself at the same time as it acts or is acted on. I say ‘immediately’ to let you know that this testimony and inner feeling [sentiment intérieur] is not distinct from the action or passion and that the actions and passions themselves make the mind aware of what is taking place within itself. Thus you will not confuse this inner feeling with the reflection we sometimes make on our actions, which is not found in all our thoughts because it is only one type of thought.12\n",

            "\n",
            "Moreover, and importantly, La Forge is quick to point out that consciousness should not be identified with reflection, a distinct second-order mental act directed toward a first-order thought. La Forge’s understanding, therefore, links (at least one of)\n",

            "Descartes’ conception(s) of consciousness as an immediate self-referential aspect to thinking with a more Malebranchian understanding of it as a “sentiment intérieur” or feeling. It is “a private and inferior kind of [felt] awareness, which is nevertheless forceful in its immediacy, and which yields us certain knowledge of our existence as thinking things.”13 After Malebranche, this meaning of ‘conscience’ became more widely accepted, even finding its way into a dictionary of philosophical terms published by Pierre-Sylvain Régis in 1690.14 Here ‘conscience’ is defined as “inner conviction . . . associated specifically with knowledge of the self.”15 The important turn taken in the meaning of ‘conscience’ in French was toward a non-evaluative form of knowledge, primarily having to do with an immediate awareness of one’s self insofar as one is having mental states. As we will see, although Descartes, Malebranche, and Arnauld did not philosophically explore the relation between conscience and thinking, all considered being conscious as involving some sort of self-referential non-evaluative knowledge. And in each case the kind of knowledge involved in being conscious can be seen to do philosophical work.\n",
            "\n",
            "Meanwhile, across the Channel, the term ‘consciousness’ saw a similar development. Hobbes, in his objections to the Meditations, interpreted Descartes’ use of ‘conscientia’ in Latin or ‘conscience’ in French to denote some sort of self-referential act of the mind: hence, his objection that Descartes’ description of conscious thinking necessarily involves a regress.16 Oddly enough, though, Hobbes’s own view seems also to endorse a self-referential element in thinking. He (1668/1996, I.ii: 17) argues in Leviathan “that being awake, I know I dreame not; though when I dreame, I think myself awake.” Why would Hobbes not think his view is vulnerable to the same regress as Descartes’? The conclusion drawn by Udo Thiel (1991: 85–6) is that when consciousness is interpreted as being a separate reflexive act of the mind directed toward one’s own mental states providing some sort knowledge of those mental states, the regress looms. But as long as the reflexivity is part of the act of thinking itself Hobbes must have considered there to be no problem.17 As we will see, a similar view of reflexivity saves later views from the same regress worry.\n",

            "Prior to Cudworth’s The True Intellectual System of the Universe in 1678, however, there was no extensive use of the term ‘consciousness,’ and Cudworth was perhaps the first “to attach to it a particular philosophical meaning.”18 As for his French\n",

            "contemporaries, consciousness for Cudworth, is “a feeling or awareness of one’s own thoughts and actions.”19 Cudworth’s contribution was philosophically to distinguish consciousness as the most fundamental form of self-relation, which is then used to explain other higher-level forms of relating to oneself, including what he calls “self-consciousness,” “reflection,” “self-judgment,” and “self-determination.” Each of these self-referential acts involves a different way of knowing or relating to oneself, often involving more than mere consciousness, but is achieved insofar as one is first conscious of one’s own thinking. What we have in Cudworth, then, is an attempt to delineate various forms of self-reference that depend on a more fundamental notion of consciousness, namely the awareness of one’s own mental states as belonging to oneself.20\n",

            "Common to these views is that consciousness involves an awareness of one’s own mental activity, some form of self-reference, and some form of non-evaluative knowledge. Now, it is widely recognized that Locke was familiar with the writings of Descartes, Malebranche, Arnauld, and Cudworth. It is reasonable, therefore, to assume that Locke’s own understanding of consciousness was influenced by what he had read.21 One way to think about the role of consciousness in Locke is to emphasize the first aspect—that we are aware of all of our thinking. Following Descartes, Locke accepts that all thinking is conscious, what is commonly referred to as the “mental transparency thesis.” But then Locke can be seen to use the mental transparency thesis as a philosophical weapon of sorts in an effort to undermine some of Descartes’ most celebrated doctrines. For example, that we are aware of all our thinking is used by Locke to argue against the view that thinking is the essence of the soul or mind.22\n",
            "\n",
            "Our experience of dreamless sleep in combination with the mental transparency thesis calls into question whether the mind is always thinking. Indeed, Jorgensen (2014) argues that putting consciousness to use against Descartes in this way can be seen as “the beginning of [Locke’s] separation of the substance from its psychological states.” Indeed, it is widely recognized that Locke’s theory of personal identity was revolutionary for its reliance on consciousness as the awareness of our mental states rather than on the persistence of a substance.\n",

            "But what Locke meant by ‘consciousness’ in its other two aspects (as a form of selfreference and as a form of non-evaluative knowledge) and how these aspects play out in his positive philosophy are still a subject of interpretive debate and where I will be\n",

I suggest that in these latter two ways, like Cudworth, Locke intended to give consciousness a distinct philosophical role to play in the Essay; yet like Descartes and his immediate followers, he did not provide the necessary analyses or arguments for how he understood that role. Therefore, it is a stretch to say that Locke has anything like a theory of consciousness. Nevertheless, I argue that he has a conception of consciousness that includes it having a philosophical role to play in other areas, specifically in his theories of knowledge and personal identity, as well as perhaps less so, but still significantly, in his understanding of moral motivation. Not only do I reiterate my view that Locke has a coherent conception of consciousness as distinct from sensation and reflection,23 but also I argue that once we understand that conception we can shed some much needed interpretive light on these other areas.\n",

            "Before moving on to Locke’s conception of consciousness, however, it is helpful to say a bit more about the philosophical landscape Locke saw with respect to the use of ‘consciousness’ or ‘conscience’ (in French) to denote a form self-referential nonevaluative knowledge. More specifically, it is beneficial to see how others wanted to attach to ‘consciousness’ or ‘conscience’ this sort of meaning, but (besides perhaps Cudworth) had not made explicit distinctions between consciousness and other thinking activities.24 Lacking these distinctions, at least for Descartes and Arnauld (and Locke as we will see), leads to philosophical problems. Lending an interpretive hand with respect to drawing adequate philosophical distinctions between consciousness and other mental activities seems to provide solutions to these problems. For example, seeing how certain internal problems in Descartes and Arnauld are successfully addressed once proper distinctions are drawn between consciousness and other mental activities sets the stage for lending similar help to Locke. In the next three sections, I briefly describe the ways in which Descartes, Malebranche, Arnauld, and Cudworth understood consciousness as a form of self-referential non-evaluative knowledge and how each treated the relation between consciousness and other mental activities. I then draw out some of the similarities between their conceptions and Locke’s. In addition, I suggest a way in which Descartes’ and Arnauld’s shared conception of consciousness is especially helpful in understanding the role Locke sees consciousness playing in the Essay. The work in this chapter is primarily to provide an orientation to the fact that the philosophical understanding of consciousness prior to and contemporary with Locke was unclear; yet each thinker was assigning to consciousness some sort of philosophical role in his model of the mind. Seeing how this role can be clarified and made use of to solve other seeming philosophical problems, especially in Descartes and Arnauld, can be seen as an analogy for what, I argue, can be done in Locke.

            "## 1.2 Descartes As already noted, in the seventeenth century the Latin ‘conscientia’ was used to connote both the moral, or evaluative, sense of conscience or inner conviction and the nonmoral, or non-evaluative, knowledge of one’s own mental states. In order to elicit the way in which the latter non-evaluative knowledge was understood, however, it is helpful to contrast it with another term used to convey the mind’s activity. That term is ‘reflexio’ or ‘reflection.’ Most generally, as noted by Thiel (1991: 83ff), ‘reflexio’ or ‘reflection’ means discursive thinking or considering. It is a general contemplative kind of thinking where the object of the thinking is something common to everyone. This is what we generally mean by “philosophical reflection,” as for example when we reflect on human nature or on the “good life.” A more narrow and interesting meaning for our purposes has to do with a turning away from the world and toward oneself, which Thiel (1994: 86ff) calls “individual reflection.” Individual reflection is a form of self-referential thinking in that it is a mental act directed toward one’s own individual thinking activities. Generally, it is a second-order thinking about one’s first-order thoughts.\n",
            "\n",
            "In scholastic doctrine, it was standard practice to distinguish thought into “direct” and “reflex” thought, where the latter consists in having a thought as an object of another thought.25 For example, Aquinas (1969: 1a, 87, 3) understood reflection to be a distinct (generally second-order) act of thinking directed toward another (generally first-order) act of thinking: “the act whereby the intellect understands a stone,” he says, “is different from the act whereby it understands that it understands a stone.”26 The reason the term ‘reflexio’ is important for the discussion here is that, as with the understanding of consciousness developed in the seventeenth century, the nature of the non-evaluative knowledge conveyed by the term ‘conscientia’ sometimes is confused with what is meant by ‘reflexio,’ or reflection. Indeed, Descartes even seems to define consciousness in terms of reflection. In the Conversation with Burman, he says, “to be aware [conscium esse] is both to think and reflect on one’s thought” (CSM III: 335; AT V: 149).27 Descartes seems to think that the reflection can be concurrent with the thought it takes for its object.28 Reflection can occur, as he\n",

This should help us to understand what role Descartes sees consciousness having in his model of the mind. Some interpretations, as noted by both Thiel (1991: 84) and Radner (1988: 439), have decided the issue as a matter of translation of the terms ‘cogitatio’ (Lat.) or ‘pensée’ (Fr.) and ‘conscientia’ (Lat.) or ‘conscience’ (Fr.) from Latin and French into English. Anscombe and Geach (1971: xlvii–xlviii), in order not to over-intellectualize the meaning of ‘cogitatio,’ translate it as ‘consciousness’ or ‘experience,’ which serves automatically to decide the philosophical issue of the relation between consciousness and thought, since it equates consciousness with regular first-order thought. Most, however, translate ‘cogitatio’ or ‘pensée’ as ‘thought’ and ‘conscientia’ or ‘conscience’ as ‘consciousness’ or ‘awareness,’ which serves to draw a distinction between the two.\n",
            "\n",
            "Despite the difference in terms, the relation between consciousness and thought is not readily clear. Let us take a look at some of the passages, as noted by Radner, that are normally taken to help decide the issue. From the next few passages we might think that Descartes understands consciousness and thinking as identical. In the Fifth Replies, Descartes tells Gassendi that he “has no right to make the inference: I walk, hence I exist, except in so far as our awareness (conscientia) of walking is a thought” (CSM II: 244; AT 7: 352). In the Second Meditation, Descartes asserts that seeming to see light, to feel heat, or to hear noise “is what is in me called feeling; and used in this precise sense that is no other thing than thinking” (CSM II: 19; AT 7: 29). And more explicitly, in the Third Replies we find “Further, there are other activities, which we call thinking activities, e.g. understanding, willing, imagining, feeling, etc., which agree in falling under the description of thought, perception, or consciousness” (CSM II: 124; AT 7: 176). In each of these passages, Descartes seems to be drawing no distinction between consciousness and thinking.29\n",

            "There are other passages, however, which Radner (1988: 440) points to, where Descartes seems to be drawing a distinction between consciousness and thought. For example, in Principles I, 9, Descartes defines thought in terms of consciousness, which suggests that he must mean them to be different, since the one is used to explain the other. Consider thought, he says, as “all those things, which, we being aware [conscious] occur in us, insofar as the awareness [consciousness] of them is in us” (CSM I: 195; AT 8A: 7). Descartes gives us the same sort of definition in the\n",

            "Moreover, he asserts that we are conscious of all our thinking: “But there can exist in us no thought of which, at the very moment that it is present in us, we are not aware [conscious]” (CSM II: 171; AT 7: 246). Descartes clarifies that when we are conscious of our thinking we are conscious of our acts of thinking—not the things we are thinking about. He says, “But it has to be noted that, while indeed we are always in actuality aware [conscious] of acts or operations of the mind, that is not the case with faculties or powers of mind, except potentially” (CSM II: 172; AT 7: 246). What these passages indicate is that Descartes understands consciousness as a form of awareness or knowledge of thinking,30 which leads to the view that Descartes considered consciousness as identical to individual reflection. This interpretation also seems consistent with the passage cited earlier from the Conversation with Burman, where Descartes says that “to be aware is both to think and to reflect on one’s thought,” and that the soul has “the power to reflect on its thoughts as often as it likes, and to be aware of its thoughts in this way” (CSM III: 335; AT 5: 149).\n",

            "There are two ways one might read the second set of passages. Either Descartes understands consciousness as a mental act distinct from thought and as identical to reflection or he understands consciousness as some sort of reflexivity inherent in all thought. Because Descartes distinguishes between the act of reflection and the thought, which is the object of the reflection, Thiel (1994: 92) takes the passage from the Conversation with Burman to confirm the first reading: When Descartes equates consciousness with reflection, he is not saying that consciousness is a reflexivity inherent in all thoughts as such. Rather, he is identifying consciousness with an explicit act of relating to oneself, distinct from the mental act reflected upon. Descartes emphasizes, however, that the act of consciousness or reflection may be simultaneous with the act reflected upon: consciousness or reflection may refer to present as well as past thoughts.31\n",

Rather than taking Descartes to mean that all consciousness consists in reflective acts of thinking, we can limit the claim by interpreting Descartes as meaning that only some of our conscious thinking consists in reflective acts.32 This opens the door to an interpretation of consciousness in Descartes that accommodates both the passages that seem to suggest that consciousness is identical to thought and the passages that indicate that consciousness is identical to a separate act of reflection. As we will see, in these latter passages Descartes can be interpreted as thinking that consciousness performs a reflective function, but it is not a separate act of reflection.33\n",

            "In virtue of all the passages cited above Radner (1988: 446) concludes that Descartes, even though it is unacknowledged by him, has two different senses of consciousness at work. In the first set of passages, acts of consciousness (C1) are modes of thinking. In these passages, Descartes seems to identify consciousness with thinking. But acts of consciousness can also be seen as “ingredients of modes of thinking.”34 This sense of consciousness (C2) is at work in the second set of passages and requires that we read the passage from the Conversation with Burman as making the limited claim that some acts of consciousness (C2) involve reflection, but (C2) is not a reflective act. That is, C2 is a reflexive awareness of thinking that is not a distinct act of reflection,35 since C2 is an “ingredient” of any thought.\n",
            "\n",
            "Radner (1988: 447) argues that we can see these two senses of consciousness as distinguished in a way somewhat similar to the distinction Brentano (1973) makes between “introspection or inner observation and inner perception in that the first requires a separate mental act whereas the second does not.” Where Brentano describes an act of hearing as taking the sound as the primary object and the hearing itself as the secondary object of the very same mental act, Radner (1988: 446) writes of Descartes that when I am conscious (C2) of thinking x “there is only one act, the\n",
            "\n",
            "act of thinking of x, which has x as its primary object and itself as its secondary object.” So consciousness as we find it in Descartes’ writings has an ambiguity. In some cases he treats it as identical to an act of thinking and in other cases he treats it as a reflexive ingredient of an act of thinking. But never, according to Radner, does Descartes identify consciousness with a separate mental act,36 which is why he does not incur the regress attributed to him by Hobbes.37\n",

            "In contrast to the kind of reflexivity involved in C2, an example of reflection proper would be thinking about my perception of something, in which case the reflective act takes another act of thinking as its object.

            "“Every thought is an object of C2,” Radner (1988: 448) explains, “but not every thought is an object of another thought.” In addition, although it goes beyond Radner’s claims and to argue the point fully is beyond the scope of what is important for the arguments in this book, my suggestion is that her argument opens the door to an interpretation of Descartes in which we can read C2 as also including a specific reference to the self.38 There is a longstanding debate concerning how exactly to interpret what is involved in arriving at the conclusion that I exist in Descartes’ cogito argument. Descartes claims that after he has doubted away everything that could possibly exist in the world, he still must be convinced that he exists: “But I have convinced myself that there is absolutely nothing in the world, no sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies. Does it now follow that I too do not exist? No: if I convinced myself of something, then I certainly existed” (CSM II: 161–7; AT VII: 25). Not even “a deceiver of great power and cunning . . . [can] bring it about that I am nothing as long as I think I am something” (CSM II: 17; AT VII: 25). “So,” says Descartes, “after\n",

            "considering everything very thoroughly, I must finally conclude that this proposition, I am, I exist, is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind” (CSM II: 17; AR VII: 25). If every thought is an object of C2, namely consciousness is a reflexive ingredient of every thought, and if as the result of every thought I can conclude that I exist, then consciousness as an awareness of an act of thinking could also allow for an awareness that I am thinking. Thus, there might be a different way to think about the cogito argument.39 Avicenna’s “Flying Man” argument, centered on the human soul’s awareness of itself without the aid of anything else, and which is often compared with Descartes’ cogito argument, is thought to show that there is an implicit and primitive form of self-awareness prior to the awareness of an object or to a more explicit knowledge of the self.40\n",

The reason, I suggest, is that Descartes and his contemporaries were breaking new ground with respect to an investigation and analysis of our own mental states. I also suggest interpretations of this sort help Descartes to draw philosophical distinctions that he was unable to make because of the paucity of philosophical context on which to build. Nevertheless, once these distinctions are drawn, other problems in Descartes’ philosophy of the mind as commonly interpreted seem to evaporate.41 As we will see in the next section, similar distinctions drawn in contemporary scholarship with respect to the role of consciousness help to solve apparent problems in Arnauld’s theory of perception.\n",

            "## 1.3 Malebranche and Arnauld Let us first consider Malebranche. Following Descartes, Malebranche employs consciousness as a self-referential form of non-evaluative knowledge, but he does not explicitly draw any distinction between consciousness and reflection. Although he does use the term ‘réflexion’ in reference to “what we sense within ourselves,” sometimes the meaning he assigns to it seems to have more to do with what Thiel (1994: 96–7) described as “philosophical reflection” on what is common to human thinking than with an individual act of reflection specifically directed toward another act of thinking.42 Malebranche, however, does exhort us to pay attention to the nature of our thinking so that we are able to make other philosophical distinctions: “If all the readers of this work would take the trouble to reflect a little on what they sense in themselves, it would not be necessary to pause here to show our dependence on sensible objects.”43 Moreover, just following this remark, he speaks of having learned from experience that “men often forget themselves so much that they do not think about what they sense, and do not inquire into the explanation of what takes place in their minds.”44 Remarks such as these suggest that Malebranche does have some notion of individual reflection in the sense of one thought being the object of another,45 even though Malebranche makes no explicit distinctions in this regard.\n",
            "\n",
            "Despite his lack of concern with the nature of reflection, it is fair to conclude that Malebranche does make a rather significant distinction between consciousness (sentiment intérieur) and other forms of knowledge. These distinctions suggest that he sees consciousness as an immediate form of self-reference and the only way in which we have knowledge of ourselves.46 Consider Malebranche’s delineation of four ways of knowing (where ‘knowing’ means ‘perceiving’) corresponding to the different sorts of objects known. We have direct and immediate knowledge of things themselves, which is the way in which we know God and ideas; we have knowledge by way of ideas, whereby we know bodies and their properties; we have knowledge by conjecture, which is how we perceive the minds of other humans and “pure intelligences,” and we have consciousness or inner sense or feeling, by which we perceive our own minds and its modifications.47 Since I am interested only in the development of the notion of consciousness, I will not take the time to explicate the other three forms of knowledge.\n",

            "have an idea of ourselves. Ideas, for Malebranche, exist independently of us as divine archetypes or ideas in the mind of God. They are intelligible to us only insofar as God makes it so that they act on us, in which case we are aware of them. Modifications of the mind or thoughts, unlike ideas, do not exist independently of us, and therefore are not intelligible to us by acting on us. Rather, modes of thought exist in us and are dependent on inner feeling or consciousness; thinking and consciousness are necessary concomitants. As Malebranche states it: Everything the soul perceives belongs to either one or two sorts: either it is in the soul, or outside the soul. The things that are in the soul are its own thoughts, i.e., all its various modifications— for by the words thought, mode of thinking, or modification of the soul, I generally understand all those things that cannot be in the soul without the soul being aware of them through the inner sensation [consciousness] it has of itself—such as its sensations, imaginings, pure intellections, or simply conceptions, as well as its passions and natural inclinations.48\n",

Radner bypasses the issue, but Thiel notes that we still do not know whether consciousness, for Malebranche, is identical to thinking or whether it is a second-order act that takes an act of thinking as its object, the difference of which is nevertheless indistinguishable to us. Remember that the direct and immediate nature of consciousness refers only to the fact that it is unmediated by ideas, and our acts of thinking are not ideas.54 So we are left with no real understanding of whether consciousness is a firstor second-order act of self-reference.\n",

            "In contrast to Malebranche, Arnauld explicitly draws the distinction between firstand second-order acts of self-reference. But Arnauld’s distinction is framed as two different kinds of reflection: réflexion virtuelle, which he sometimes refers to as consciousness and réflexion expresse.55 Arnauld (1990: VI, 71) differentiates them as follows: “The first is that our thought or perception is essentially reflective upon itself: or, as it is said rather better in Latin, est sui conscia. For I do not think without knowing that I think; I do not know a square without knowing that I know it; or to avoid any doubt, I do not imagine I see the sun, without being certain that I imagine I see it.” Réflexion virtuelle describes the way in which all thinking has an implicit reflection upon itself. As well as this “implicit reflection, which accompanies all our perceptions,” continues Arnauld, “there is also something explicit [réflexion expresse], which occurs when we examine our perception by means of another perception.” Réflexion virtuelle, then, is a reflexive aspect of every perception or thinking by which we are aware that we are perceiving. It is not a distinct act of perception itself, but rather a reflexive self-awareness implicit in an act of perception.56 Réflexion expresse, on the other hand, is a distinct mental act that takes the original perception as its object. For example, “when a geometer finds in examining his perception of a triangle that, having conceived it as a figure bounded by three straight lines, it must\n",
            "\n",
            "have three angles, and that these three angles are equal to two right angles,” she is expressly reflecting on the perception of a triangle. Arnauld, therefore, clearly distinguishes consciousness and reflection, even though he uses the term réflexion for both, and he locates the self-reference involved in consciousness as an aspect of any perception.\n",
            "\n",
            "Nadler (1989: 118–22) argues that understanding réflexion virtuelle as the way in which a perception is reflexive on itself helps to explain why Arnauld can consistently hold a direct realist theory of perception.57 Arnauld’s chief problem as traditionally understood is that he seems to say that we perceive objects directly and at the same time that he “does not reject” a description of perception according to which “we do not see things immediately; it is the ideas of them which are the immediate object of our thought.”58 How can ideas mediate between objects and us, but at the same time we can be said to perceive objects directly? Nadler (1989: 118–22) offers the following solution. First, he interprets Arnauld’s claim that “the idea of an object and the perception of that object . . . [are] . . . the same thing” as saying not that they are in a relation of inseparability, but rather they are identical: the act of perception and the idea are one thing under different descriptions bearing relations to different things. When described as an “act of perception,” the perception/idea is in relation to the mind as modification, and when described as an “idea,” it is in relation to an object as representation.59 Nadler refers to the act of perception, which is identical to an idea, as a “perception-idea.” Moreover, Nadler (1989: 115) points out that Arnauld employs the scholastic distinction between an id quod intelligitur, namely what is actually understood, and an id quo intelligitur, namely that by means of which the intellect understands. Nadler (1989: 121) explains that the perception-idea is an id quo and the réflexion virtuelle that accompanies every perception-idea is that by means of which the perception-idea is an id quod. The perception-idea, therefore, is understood by means of itself insofar as it has an accompanying réflexion virtuelle. But Arnauld wants to claim that we have direct perception of the object, and there is nothing in this analysis so far that is not also consistent with a representational theory, since the perception-idea can be said to be an id quo —that by means of which it itself is\n",
            "\n",
            "That is, nothing in Nadler’s interpretation of Arnauld changes except whether to call him a representationalist or a direct realist—an issue orthogonal to finding a reflexive self-referential act of perception in Arnauld’s perceptual theory.\n",
            "\n",
            "understood—and also something intermediate between the mind and the object. How, then, is there direct perceptual access to the object?\n",
            "\n",
            "Analogously to what we saw in Radner’s interpretation of Descartes, making better sense of what we find in Arnauld results from recognizing the way in which we should be interpreting Arnauld’s understanding of consciousness. By interpreting Arnauld as meaning consciousness, or réflexion virtuelle, as a reflexive constituent of a perceptionidea rather than as a separate reflective act, argues Nadler, Arnauld can have a direct awareness of an object, or at least its objective reality,60 by virtue of being conscious of a perception-idea. First, let us take a look at Arnauld’s explanation: Since every perception is essentially representative of something, and is thus called an idea, a perception cannot be essentially reflective on itself without this idea (that is, the objective reality of the thing which the mind is said to perceive) being its immediate object. So that . . . the objective reality . . . is the object of this perception. (emphases added)61 When we have a perception-idea, what is represented by the perception-idea under the description “idea” is the objective reality of the external object. For our purposes here we can just say that the objective reality of an idea, for Arnauld, is its representational content.62 And because the perception-idea is “essentially reflective on itself,” the objective reality must be the immediate object of the perception-idea. Therefore, in perceiving we are directly aware of that objective reality. Nadler (1989: 121) sums it up this way: Arnauld’s position is simply the following: every act of perception, by which we immediately and directly perceive an external object . . . is also immediately reflective upon itself. Thus, when directly perceiving an external thing, one is always aware that one is perceiving that thing. . . .\n",

            "Arnauld later states that . . . the act of perception is essentially representative of the external object perceived, and thus is the object in the understanding objectivement or intelligiblement. . . . The same act of perception which reflects [virtuelle] on (is aware of) itself is the means of perceiving immediately and directly an external body. As he puts it, a perception is both id quo intelligitur and id quod intelligitur.\n",

            "By interpreting Arnauld to understand consciousness (réflexion virtuelle) as a reflexive form of self-reference that is not a mental act separate from the perception-idea, Nadler clarifies and makes coherent what has otherwise been interpreted as being an inconsistency or at least a conundrum in Arnauld’s theory of perception.63 Because consciousness accompanies perception, what is represented by the perception-idea\n",
            "\n",
            "can be seen as an object of direct awareness without the mediation of some other perception-idea—or even as mediated by the perception-idea itself. The upshot is that when I have a perception-idea, I am directly and immediately conscious of an objective reality. Therefore, Arnauld can make use of the notion that perceptionideas are representative but still maintain a direct theory of perception.64 Insofar as Arnauld is a part of the philosophical discussion that influenced the meaning of ‘consciousness’ and its role in perception in the second half of the seventeenth century, he brings to the table (with some help from Nadler) the view that consciousness is a reflexive self-referential form of non-evaluative knowledge that in some way accompanies or is in internal to every perception.65 It is neither identical to the perception nor a separate act distinct from that perception.\n",

Cudworth used ‘consciousness’ as a translation for the Greek synaisthēsis, which suggests that it is the feeling or immediate perception of one’s own activities.67 He (1678: 159) describes consciousness as that “which makes a Being to be present with itself.” Like Descartes, Malebranche, and Arnauld, Cudworth thinks we are conscious of all our thinking.68 Consciousness, as he describes it, is an explicit self-reference that includes a “Duplication”: “it is an explicit reference to the self where the self is the subject (i.e. that which is conscious) as well as the object of consciousness (i.e. that which I am aware of when I am conscious).”69 There is\n",

Where Thiel (1991: 89–91) takes Cudworth to be saying that consciousness is a mental act distinct from the thought which is its object,70 Lähteenmäki (2010: 21–2) understands “the subject–object distinction [as] within consciousness.” Thus, Lähteenmäki sees Cudworth’s understanding of the reflexivity in consciousness to be similar to what Arnauld designated as réflexion virtuelle. I think the real difference between their views is not so much whether or not for Cudworth the most fundamental form of self-reference includes a reflexivity somewhat like Arnauld’s réflexion virtuelle, but rather whether or not we should see the reflexivity as a fundamental form of selfreference leading up to other more sophisticated forms of self-reference (Thiel) or whether we should see it as the lowest level of consciousness within degrees of consciousness (Lähteenmäki).71 Although, for Cudworth, consciousness as synaisthēsis is not the only form of self-reference (Thiel), or the only form of consciousness (Lähteenmäki), it is the most fundamental form and that which makes all other forms of self-reference possible. In spite of their differences as to whether the reflexive nature of thinking should be thought of as the lowest level of self-reference leading up to other forms of self-reference or as the lowest degree of consciousness, Thiel and Lähteenmäki agree that, for Cudworth, mere reflexivity does not gives us selfconsciousness. Here Pécharman (2014: 292) disagrees: Instead of confining self-consciousness inside one rank of self-reference/consciousness, corresponding to the relation of a rational subject to herself as to a moral agent, I shall argue that the self-perception which Cudworth associates with animal perception can be considered as a first-level self-consciousness. I do not separate self-perception from self-consciousness, since there is in TISU [Cudworth 1678] no textual evidence that they should be distinguished.\n",

Importantly, though, we should not confuse the self-reference involved in self-consciousness with the self-reference involved in consciousness as synaisthēsis. Consciousness as synaisthēsis is a fundamental form of self-reference in that it is that which makes us present to ourselves; “self-consciousness” requires more, namely an additional mental act. Cudworth (1678: 637) says, “we are certain of the Existence of our own\n",
            "\n",
            "Souls, partly from an inward Consciousness of our own Cogitations, and partly from that Principle of Reason, That, Nothing can not Act.” It seems that knowledge of our own existence (self-consciousness) requires both consciousness (as synaisthēsis) and reason.\n",
            "\n",
            "That is, from the fact that we are present to ourselves when we are thinking—that we can consciously ascribe thoughts and actions to ourselves—we can infer that we exist.\n",
            "\n",
            "Both Thiel and Lähteenmäki describe this distinction (between self-consciousness and synaisthēsis) as allowing Cudworth to hold both the view that all sentient beings are conscious, but all sentient beings are not self-conscious, namely not all sentient beings have knowledge of the existence of their own souls.73 Pécharman, as we have seen, argues that some form of self-consciousness should also be assigned to nonhuman animals.\n",
            "\n",
            "Cudworth identifies three other forms of self-reference (what Lähteenmäki calls “aspects of self-consciousness”) that in some way depend on consciousness as selfpresence or self-attribution.74 First, there is the self-knowledge gained through “reflection,” which is consistent in meaning with the Latin reflexio, namely a higher-order thinking about other thoughts. As with self-consciousness, in reflection we gain a higher-level knowledge of ourselves than what we have in consciousness as synaisthēsis.\n",
            "\n",
            "Cudworth (1838: 71) says, “We are certain by inward sense that we can reflect upon ourselves and consider ourselves, which is a reduplication of life in a higher degree; for all cogitative beings as such are self-conscious.” Cudworth’s use of ‘self-conscious’ at the end of the passage is not the consciousness of the self in terms of its existence, but rather the consciousness of thoughts and actions in the more fundamental form of selfattribution.75 So, Cudworth seems to be saying that although all sentient beings are conscious of their thoughts and actions, only those beings capable of higher-order reflective mental activity are also capable of higher-order knowledge not only of their own thoughts, but also of themselves. In taking a higher-level reflective stance toward our own conscious thoughts we gain a more contemplative or objectified knowledge of the self. Although knowledge of the existence of the self comes by way of selfconsciousness, knowledge of the self as object comes by way of reflection, and both, therefore, are available only to rational and reflective beings.76\n",
            "\n",
            "In addition, having the ability to reflect leads to another form of self-reference (or self-consciousness), namely “self-judgment.” Self-judgment can be seen to result\n",
            "\n",
            "from taking a reflective stance toward those actions we have attributed to ourselves by virtue of consciousness. So again self-judgment is the result of a combination or duplication of higher and lower forms of self-reference.77 On the lower level of consciousness (synaisthēsis) we become “Attentive . . . to [our] own Actions, or Animadversive to them.”78 But when we engage in a higher-order reflection on those actions as attributed to us, we gain a “conscience,” namely we can compare those actions we have attributed to ourselves to some distinction between right and wrong. As Cudworth explains, conscience “is attributed to rational beings only, and such as are sensible of the discrimen honestorum or turpium when they judge of their own actions according to that rule, and either condemn or acquit themselves.”79 Because we attribute actions to ourselves in one form of self-reference and we are capable of measuring those actions to standards of right and wrong in another form of self-reference, we are able to judge (“condemn or acquit”) ourselves, which is a third form of self-reference.80\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, once there is self-reference by consciousness and reflection, there is also the possibility of self-reference by “self-determination” with respect to action. Cudworth says, “Wherefore that which is thus conscious of itself, and reflexive upon itself, either as fortuitously determining its own activity, or else as intending and exerting itself more or less in order to the promoting of its own good.”81 In response to the concern that determinism disallows one thing to be both the subject acting and the object acted upon, Cudworth explains that the answer lies in the “duplication” of self-reference involved in being both conscious and capable of reflection.82 Moreover, this duplication is analogous to the duplication of the self involved in consciousness.\n",
            "\n",
            "Just as a “duplication” in consciousness (as synaisthēsis) includes a relation to the self as both subject and object, there is a “duplication” of self-relation in consciousness and reflection that allows for a subject to act on itself as object. In consciousness there is a reference to the self as subject (that which is conscious) and object (that of which I am conscious). In reflection one conscious thought is taken as the object of another.\n",

            "Therefore, in reflection the subject that is reflecting is the same self as the self that has the thought reflected on. The self that is reflecting is acting on itself as the object of that reflection.83 Therefore, contrary to the worry that determinism cannot allow self-determination, Cudworth argues that because consciousness is a fundamental co-presence of the self as subject and object there is indeed the possibility of reflective self-determination.84\n",

            "## 1.5 Locke’s Development (Parallels to Locke) What we see in Cudworth is an understanding of consciousness as a fundamental form of self-reference that makes possible other types of self-reference. Consciousness in combination with other acts of the mind, primarily reason and reflection, allows for the knowledge we have of our own existence and of ourselves as objects as well as for how we are related to ourselves practically in terms of conscience (self-judgment) and in terms of a unity of consciousness leading to self-determination. Having philosophically distinguished the most fundamental form of consciousness as an immediate non-evaluative self-reference from other more sophisticated forms of self-reference, especially from the kind of self-reference we find in conscience, Cudworth succeeds in articulating an undercurrent that had been percolating in the decades before him. Indeed, as all of the thinkers I have mentioned realized, conscience as evaluative self-reference cannot do the right kind of work to ground these nonmoral aspects of our psychology. Therefore, as Cudworth (and I think Locke indirectly) realized, moral evaluation of ourselves requires first that we have a more fundamental awareness of ourselves as subjects. As we will see in the following chapters, although Locke does not distinguish the same kinds of self-reference, he can be seen to have an understanding of consciousness as a fundamental form of selfreference, or self-attribution of thoughts and actions, that plays a role in other forms of self-reference. I will argue that, like Cudworth’s, Locke’s conception of consciousness includes a relation to the self as subject that plays a role in how we know our own existence and how we experience ourselves as moral agents, although in both cases the account will be somewhat different from what we find in Cudworth. Locke can also be seen to have a role for the unity of consciousness in determining the moral value of actions.\n",
            "\n",
            "Moreover, for Locke as well as for Cudworth, consciousness alone is sufficient for the presence of the self to itself, but reflection is also required to generate a fullfledged idea of the self. Interestingly, Locke and Cudworth can be seen to share this feature of consciousness with Malebranche, although for Locke and for Cudworth, ideas are in our minds, not in God’s. La Forge, Malebranche, Cudworth, and Locke can also be said to share the view that consciousness involves more of a sentiment or feeling than an idea. More importantly, although Locke does not specifically call consciousness a sentiment or feeling, he does say that we cannot think without being “sensible of it” and that being sensible of our own thinking is necessary to thinking “till we can think without being conscious of it” (II.i.10).\n",

            "Most important to understanding how we should read Locke’s conception of consciousness, however, is its similarity to Descartes’ and Arnauld with respect to the relation between consciousness, first-order thought, and reflection (considered as a distinct act of second-order thought). The important point is to notice how each can be helped to a coherent conception of consciousness with respect to thought and reflection once consciousness is interpreted as a reflexive constituent of any thought.\n",

            "Once this conception of consciousness is recognized in Descartes—what Radner designated C2—not only can we make better sense of the text, but the regress problem attributed to him by Hobbes as well as other interpretive problems simply evaporates. Likewise, when a similar conception of consciousness is attributed to Arnauld, the seeming inconsistency in his claim to have a direct theory of perception dissolves—or at least we can see why he would take himself to have such a theory.\n",

            "Moreover, as with Descartes and Arnauld, such an interpretation of consciousness, for Locke, is sufficiently supported by the text. And also as we saw with Descartes and Arnauld, once Locke is seen as having this conception of consciousness, as well as the resulting complexity it lends to our perceptual states, certain seemingly intractable problems have solutions: Locke’s conception of consciousness and reflection is coherent; we can make sense of his claims that we have knowledge of particular individual things (our ideas, ourselves, and external objects), even though knowledge generally is the perception of an agreement of ideas; we can understand his even more puzzling repeated claims that what we know of the existence of particular external objects counts as a genuine form of knowledge as opposed to belief; we can fill out the grounds of his conception of moral motivation, and we can finally understand what Locke is really up to in his theory of personal identity. Indeed, the conception of consciousness as a self-referential, non-evaluative constituent of thinking is an idea abroad in the seventeenth century, albeit germinating and insufficiently articulated. As I will interpret it in Locke, it is a view of consciousness that gains notoriety with the development of phenomenological theories in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. We can even draw significant similarities to what are now called “self-representational” theories of consciousness.85\n",

Responding to apparent inconsistencies in Locke’s philosophical psychology, I argue that once we provide such an interpretation of consciousness these difficulties disappear. In addition, consciousness so interpreted helps to make sense of the work Locke seems to see consciousness doing in his theories of knowledge, personal identity, and moral agency. What results is the view that Locke understands perception in general as having a certain complexity that explains how consciousness carries out the roles Locke either assigns it explicitly or has it doing implicitly in these other aspects of his philosophy. What becomes apparent in this second chapter is that because consciousness is a constituent of any perceptual act, every perception of an idea is a complex mental state that includes an act of perception, an idea, and consciousness.86\n",

            "\n",
            "Knowledge, for Locke, consists in “the perception of the connexion and agreement, or disagreement and repugnancy of any of our ideas” (IV.i.2). What we will see is that any knowledge state is a complex mental state that includes agreements or disagreements between constituent elements. And when it comes to our knowledge of individual things, consciousness plays an active role in constituting those agreements. Part I of chapter three focuses on two cases of knowing a particular thing that receive little attention in Locke scholarship: the intuitive knowledge of our own individual ideas and the intuitive knowledge of ourselves—the latter being Locke’s version of the cogito argument. Once we appreciate that perceptions of ideas are complex mental states, we can see how, for Locke, we can have knowledge consistent with his general definition when we seem to perceive only one idea. One fortuitous consequence of the analysis of how these agreements are constituted is clarification of how we have, as Locke claims, non-inferential knowledge of these individual things (both ourselves and ideas), something he leaves relatively obscure. In part II of chapter three, I extend the analysis by providing a structurally similar explanation of the agreement in a case of sensitive knowledge (of the existence of an external object) such that all of Locke’s claims concerning the nature of knowledge in general and the nature of the agreement in sensitive knowledge are accounted for. Once we have the agreement in sensitive knowledge in hand, part III of this chapter provides a detailed argument reconciling Locke’s representational theory of perception (that ideas are the direct objects of acts of perception) with his categorization of sensitive knowledge as a legitimate form of knowledge with a degree of certainty along with intuitive and demonstrative knowledge. As in parts I and II, in part III we see that the\n",
            "\n",
            "role of consciousness in constituting the agreement known in an instance of sensitive knowledge is what drives Locke to claim it is indeed a form of certain knowledge, albeit with a lesser degree of certainty than what we normally consider knowledge.\n",

            "From my interpretation of consciousness as a constituent of a more complex perceptual state there results something brand new to Locke scholarship: a structurally integrated account of how, for Locke, we have knowledge of individual things (our own ideas, ourselves, and external objects) consistent with all of his other commitments.87\n",
            "\n",
            "Consciousness as internal to every mental state also helps to explain, in chapter four, what Locke is up to in his theory of personal identity. I argue that in that chapter of the Essay Locke uses the term ‘consciousness’ ambiguously to mean both the state of awareness of myself as perceiving ideas and the ongoing self I am aware of in those mental states.88 That is, Locke combines a psychological aspect to personal identity with a metaphysical aspect that is not identified with either thinking or bodily substance. In so doing, his theory is able to do all the work it has to do without incurring any of those sticky problems of circularity, failure of transitivity, or inadequacy for divine rectification so often attributed to him.89 Importantly also, my interpretation is the only one, to my knowledge, that preserves transitivity, and unlike some interpretations that claim to resolve the other problems, mine comes at no textual or philosophical cost. Finally, in chapter five, I extend my interpretation of consciousness to Locke’s account of freedom and moral agency and specifically to his arguments for moral motivation. First, taking responsibility for our past actions as well having motivation to do that which we ought to do requires that we see ourselves as the same self extending into the past and into the future. Because consciousness is a fundamental self-awareness constituent of every mental state, we are able to experience a unity of consciousness, namely the experience of a past and future self, in different perceptual situations. Only so are we able to generate the concern for the happiness of a future self as required for moral agency.\n",
            "\n",
            "Second, Locke’s account of moral agency requires that we are able to suspend a pressing desire in order to engage in a rational assessment of whether or not a particular action best achieves our long-term happiness. Locke, however, provides only a sketch of how we are able to generate the proper motivation to suspend desire.\n",
            "\n",

            "ceasing” (I.iii.3). I provide a novel solution to this problem by arguing in detail that insofar as we are intellectual beings fully able to engage in a rational deliberation about what to do, we have a natural concern for our own future happiness, namely that what we are innately driven toward is true as opposed to apparent happiness. Such concern is grounded in the fact that we are the kind of self-conscious beings we are.\n",

            "Resulting from this analysis is a comprehensive and coherent story of the positive role of consciousness in Locke’s philosophy. It begins by distinguishing a nonevaluative self-referential awareness internal to our own thinking and then follows the contribution of that aspect of Locke’s philosophical psychology through his theories of knowledge, personal identity, and moral agency. Once we complete the account of the role of consciousness in moral agency, we will see that, for Locke, as we saw very briefly in Cudworth, moral self-evaluation cannot be the only kind of selfawareness, for having a conscience at all depends on first having consciousness.90\n",

From this point onward, I will tackle the problem internally, by focusing on Locke’s use of the term in the Essay.

The difference is that “Reflection is consciousness that is attended to and retained” (119). I hesitate to place LoLordo in this group, since her interpretation is much more complex and nuanced than the others and so escapes many of the problems these others incur.

Our being sensible of it is not necessary to anything, but to our thoughts; and to them it is; and to them it will always be necessary, till we can think without being conscious of it” (II.i.10).

For example, in IV.ii.14, we find Locke asking rhetorically whether one “be not invincibly conscious to himself of a different Perception, when he looks on the Sun by day, and thinks on it by night” (my emphasis).

Innate ideas, if not yet perceived, must somehow be already in the mind prior to any new ideas originating in either sensation or reflection. But, for Locke, ideas that are in the mind but not presently perceived are experienced as memories. So, just as we can tell the difference between a new idea and a memory, to claim that we have innate ideas requires that we can also identify them as somehow different from memories.

Thus, the argument that there are innate ideas rests on answering Locke’s challenge to show that we have ideas that are experienced as neither new to the mind nor as memories. Therefore, to understand consciousness as identical to perception in general is to ignore Locke’s explicit claim that consciousness does additional work in distinguishing or singling out memories as memories, and therefore to ignore the essential role consciousness plays in Locke’s first-line defense of empiricism.

No Man, can be wholly ignorant of what he does when he thinks. These simple Ideas, when offered to the mind, the Understanding can no more refuse to have, nor alter, when they are imprinted, nor blot them out, and make new ones in it self, than a mirror can refuse, alter, or obliterate the Images or Ideas, which, the Objects set before it, do therein produce.

Therefore, this passage is understood to be saying that the reason I am not ignorant of what I am doing when I am thinking is that I have a particular idea of my thinking. But if consciousness is responsible for ideas of my thinking, and ideas of my thinking are ideas of reflection, then, as Kulstad (1991) and others have argued, we should understand Locke to be identifying consciousness and reflection.17 Thus, conscious states are reflective states, which means that any mental state emerging as the result of consciousness is the result of a second-order reflective act.\n",

In II.i.8 he admits that children might have “floating Visions,” namely some perception of their own thinking; yet he explicitly denies that children can reflect: And hence we see the reason, why ’tis pretty late, before most Children get Ideas of the Operations of their own Minds; and some have not very clear, or perfect Ideas of the greatest part of them all their Lives. Because, though they pass there continually; yet like floating Visions, they make not deep Impressions enough, to leave in the Mind clear and distinct lasting Ideas, until the Understanding turns inwards upon it self, reflects on its own Operations, and makes them the Object of its own Contemplation.

            "must be due to consciousness. But if they are, and consciousness and reflection are the same mental act, then Locke contradicts his claim in II.i.8 that young children, though conscious, do not reflect.18 In Locke’s defense it seems unlikely he would make this mistake. The lack of reflective abilities in young children is important to his commitment to reflection as a more mature kind of thinking. Since reflection is a higher-level thinking about perceptions of ideas that leads to clearer and more distinct ideas concerning our mental operations, it is likely that Locke thought young children are incapable of gaining those ideas necessary to higher forms of knowledge.19\n",

            "\n",
            "All thinking, for Locke, is conscious, and consciousness is thought to be some sort of perception of a perception. It follows that if consciousness bears a relation to ideas that produces more ideas, then any perception by consciousness results in a mental state that must itself be perceived by consciousness. This results in another mental state of which we must be conscious, and so on. In fact, in the II.xxvii.9 passage already noted Locke surprisingly seems to imply such a regress. When Locke says that “consciousness . . . is inseparable from thinking, and as it seems to me essential to it,” and then goes on to say that it is “impossible for any one to perceive without perceiving, that he does perceive,” it is clear that he must intend ‘perceiving’ to be synonymous with ‘consciousness.’ Therefore, if the way in which we perceive in being conscious is identified with the way in which we perceive in reflection, then the regress is unavoidable. It is hard to imagine Locke espousing such a view.\n",

            "### 2.2.2 Consciousness is a source of ideas The last interpretation argues that Locke means to have consciousness as different from reflection but nonetheless a higher-order awareness resulting in ideas, namely the origin of those ideas constituting the awareness of our own thinking.20 This interpretation allows a reconciliation of the passages above, because as long as consciousness is different from reflection, it can be seen to produce the “obscure Notions” in II.i.25 and the “floating Visions” in II.i.8. But the problem with this interpretation is that it contradicts Locke’s II.i.4 claim that sensation and reflection are the only sources of our ideas: These two, I say, viz. External Material things, as the Objects of SENSATION; and the Operations of our Minds within, as the Objects of REFLECTION, are to me, the only Originals, from whence all our Ideas take their beginnings.

We also know that whatever we say about consciousness must be reconcilable with Locke’s understanding of the “obscure Notions” in II.i.25 and the vague “floating visions” in II.i.8. Furthermore, the interpretation must be able to make sense of the explicit roles Locke sees consciousness playing in memory, sensitive knowledge, his version of the cogito, and personal identity, as well as its implicit role in moral agency. As was done for Descartes and Arnauld, I suggest that providing a coherent theory can be accomplished for Locke if we understand his view to be that consciousness is a reflexive self-referential awareness internal to ordinary perception.\n",
            "\n",
            "In short, consciousness, for Locke, is not a mental act additional to the original perceiving of an idea, but rather an awareness internal to it. This requires that we see the perception of an idea as a complex mental state that includes being conscious that we are perceiving the idea. Therefore, constituent in each perception of an idea is the idea perceived, as well as the consciousness of ourselves as perceiving it. For Locke, every act of perception has an object—an idea, namely that toward which we are attending in the perceiving. But also Locke thinks there is an element of reflexivity internal to every perception, which allows for an awareness of and referring of the perception to myself.22\n",

The idea of the cat is the primary object of the perception. My so perceiving the idea is a self-referential reflexive constituent of the very same perception. We want to be careful not to attribute to Locke the view that consciousness takes for itself an object in describing the nature of consciousness and its relation to ordinary perception, for we do not want to reinvite the regress. Rather, we should see consciousness as a special kind of awareness of ourselves as perceiving that is internal to the complex mental act of perceiving an idea. But in being conscious there is no new act of perception, and therefore, there is generated no new idea. Moreover, it is possible that Locke’s account of the complexity in perceiving ideas involves more than an act of perception, an idea perceived, and the self-consciousness that I am perceiving. In later chapters, I will defend the view that there is another constituent of the complex mental state that is the perception of any idea, which allows that we have different forms of knowledge as the result of perceiving an idea: We have intuitive knowledge of the idea and of our own existence, and when we perceive an occurrent idea of sensation, we have sensitive knowledge. In these cases, seeing perceptions of ideas as complex mental states that include consciousness, as well as other elements, allows Locke to hold the view, for which there is significant textual evidence, that we have certain forms of knowledge as the result of perceiving an idea.23 Importantly for now, because consciousness is understood as a self-referential constituent of ordinary perception, it is not an additional mental act above and beyond the original perception.\n",

Phenomenological theories, in general, distinguish themselves from explanations of consciousness that appeal to higherorder perceptions or thoughts by arguing that consciousness should be understood as intrinsic to the original mental state. Because they are considered “one-level” theories, they do not obviously invite a regress. For example, Brentano (1973: 127–8), from whom many “one-level” theories are derived, argued that consciousness is not a new mental state but something intrinsic to a perception that is directed toward that perception. Every experience has internal to it both a primary and a secondary object.\n",

            "\n",
            "We can say that the sound is the primary object of the act of hearing, and that the act of hearing itself is the secondary object.” Therefore, Brentano thinks he has avoided a regress of perceptions by virtue of the fact that what makes a mental state conscious is an intrinsic and dependent feature of the original mental state.24 Nevertheless, because consciousness takes the perceptual act as an object, even if only secondarily, many have argued that Brentano indeed has two mental acts and thus falls into a form of the very regress he is trying to avoid.25 The problem, which later phenomenological theories take great pains to stress, is that continuing to see consciousness as having a subject– object relation does not go far enough. Consciousness should not be seen as having an object. I mention Brentano here only to help orient the reader to the way in which consciousness can be seen as intrinsic to a perceptual act, and thus how it can be seen to fit into Locke’s philosophical psychology. It is a reflexive self-referential awareness internal to all perceptions of ideas. In the previous chapter, we saw that Descartes, La Forge, Arnauld, and Cudworth also can be seen to hold similar views.26 Moreover, I am\n",

            "Furthermore, it does not follow necessarily that in being conscious I am perceiving; the sort of awareness I have of myself entails that consciousness takes the self as an object. According to Sartre (1956), self-consciousness can be both reflective and pre-reflective. When consciousness is pre-reflective, we are aware of ourselves as having mental states, but we are not aware of ourselves thematically—not, say, as objects. To know ourselves in this way would require a further act of reflection on that of which we are pre-reflectively conscious. Sartre (1956: liii) says, “it is the nonreflective consciousness which renders the reflection possible; there is a pre-reflective cogito which is the condition of the Cartesian cogito.” Therefore, also with respect to self-consciousness phenomenologists would deny that there is a subject–object relation involved in being pre-reflectively conscious. As Dan Zahavi (2005: 23–4), a contemporary phenomenologist, explains it: All [phenomenologists] argue that consciousness and self-consciousness are closely linked. All defend what might be called a one-level account of consciousness. Moreover—and this might come as a surprise to those who believe that one of the central doctrines in phenomenology is the doctrine of intentionality, that is, the claim that all consciousness is intentional, that all consciousness is object-consciousness—they also reject the attempt to construe intransitive consciousness in terms of transitive consciousness, that is, they reject the view that a conscious state is a state of which we are intentionally conscious.\n",

It looks just a bit (but only a bit!) like Brentano in that consciousness is seen as a reflexive awareness internal to an act of perception. It is a bit like Sartre and some contemporary phenomenological theories in that consciousness is a kind of pre-reflective awareness of myself as perceiving an idea—“humming along in the background,” as Kriegel describes it. And, like Sartre, Locke would require an additional act of reflection in order to perceive an idea of myself. Locke can also be seen to include a distinction like Sartre’s between a pre-reflective consciousness giving us an implicit awareness of ourselves as perceiving and a later reflection (as Locke understands it) on consciousness that results in a full-fledged idea of the self.29\n",

An advantage to reading Locke’s conception of consciousness in this way is that it solves the interpretive problem posed by these passages, because we no longer have to understand Locke as equating the “obscure Notions” in II.i.25 and the “floating Visions” in II.i.8 with ideas of reflection. Instead, they can be seen to refer to the conscious awareness internal to the perception of the ideas in question.31 The reason is that although Locke is clear that we are conscious of each and every mental state, he does not think that we reflect every time we have a mental state.32 He is very clear that young children have mental states but they do not engage in reflection (II.i.8). Therefore, the fact that we are never ignorant of our thinking need not mean that we must have reflected and thereby produced ideas of that thinking. Rather, we can be aware of ourselves as thinking (or better, that we are thinking) simply in virtue of consciousness. Moreover, as we saw in II.i.8, Locke thinks that mental operations “pass continually” in the minds of children; yet there are no clear and distinct ideas of those mental operations until “the Understanding turns inwards upon it self ” and reflects on them.

The first thing to say in reply is that II.i.25 is a very puzzling passage and therefore not the best one on which to hang an interpretation that contradicts some of Locke’s most closely held commitments such as the empiricist principle or the lack of reflective abilities in young children. Indeed, a closer reading of the passage from II.i.25 reveals the answer to the objection.34\n",

What becomes clear is that II.i.25 is not at all about reflection, but about sensation. The “obscure Notions” should be understood as consciousness of perceptions caused by the “Objects of our Senses [that] . . . obtrude their particular Ideas upon our minds” (II.i.25). And the fact that we are conscious of our perceptions involving sensations—namely, perceptions of ideas of sensation—does not imply that in being conscious of these perceptions we have additional ideas of mental operations, or ideas of reflection. Thus, the obtruding ideas are from objects of the senses, and what is unavoidable is our perception of them. But to perceive ideas of sensation is to think, and Locke is clear that all thinking is conscious. So, the idea of sensation is the object of the perception, while the “obscure Notions” constitute the consciousness that I am perceiving it. The “obscure Notions” are unavoidable, asserts Locke, because consciousness is internal to every perception; it is a reflexive awareness of myself as perceiving an idea. Therefore, it is impossible to be wholly ignorant—to have no awareness at all—of what we are doing when we think, namely, when we have those perceptions of ideas caused by external objects.35 Consciousness as intrinsic to the act of perception provides a fundamental first-personal experience\n",

In agreement with my analysis of consciousness as a reflexive constituent of any perception and with my analysis of the passage from II.i.25 in my earlier work, Thiel (2011) offers an amendment explaining why the content of consciousness need not be seen as conflicting with Locke’s I.i.8 claim about ideas. Because consciousness is an intrinsic feature of perception, it need not be structurally identical to ordinary perceptions like sensation or reflection. Here is how Thiel (2011: 116) replies to the objection: But what about the objection that such a direct relation of consciousness to mental states and operations means that there are for Locke objects of thought and experience that are not ideas—which would contradict Locke’s thesis that ideas are the only objects of thought and experience?

            "There are still additional reasons for interpreting the disputed passage in II.i.25 to be about consciousness of our ideas of sensation rather than about reflection. One reason is that this passage is surrounded by references to ideas of sensation. Locke says, “Objects of our Senses obtrude their particular Ideas upon our minds,” and although the next sentence is about operations of the mind, it is unlikely Locke is saying that we are engaging in any second-order thinking about those operations. Locke does not say that reflection will not let us be without obscure notions of our thinking; in fact there is no mention of reflection at all. Rather, he continues with additional references to “Images and Ideas,” produced by “Objects set before [the Understanding].” Moreover, the sentence immediately following is an even clearer statement that the “Images and Ideas” produced are ideas of bodies: “As the Bodies that surround us do diversely affect our Organs, the mind is forced to receive Impressions; and cannot avoid the Perception of those Ideas that are annexed to them.” In other words, to have the ideas of sensation that are forced on us we must engage in perception, and we must be conscious of that perception; even the most rudimentary sensations entail thinking. But this does not mean there is present any other idea, namely, something produced owing to a secondorder reflection, than what is involved in having a sensation. And so, that we are conscious that we are thinking (that we are perceiving ideas of sensation) need not mean that consciousness is a mental act additional to our thinking.

Thus, the “obscure Notions” in II.i.25 can be due to reflection. Nevertheless, she argues, because we do not have ideas of reflection until we attend to what is given in consciousness, the “obscure Notions” are not ideas. Only when there is attention is reflection a source of ideas, which results in “lasting ideas” of reflection. As she (2012: 119) says, “Reflection is consciousness that is attended to and retained.” Here is LoLordo’s (2012: 120) explanation of the relation between sensation, reflection, and consciousness: When I see a cat lying on the windowsill, I am thereby conscious of the cat. . . . If I am attending to my consciousness of the cat, I can form a lasting idea of him. In this case, sensation is the source of my idea: the lasting idea I form is an idea of sensation. If I am attending to my consciousness of the act of perception, I can form a lasting idea of the act of perception. In this case, reflection is the source of my idea: the lasting idea of perception I form is an idea of reflection.\n",

            "One thing to say is that on LoLordo’s account it turns out that reflection is not a higherorder perception. Because of the symmetry in the production of ideas of sensation and ideas of reflection, it cannot be. This just seems odd to me, especially in light of the historical context in which reflection was almost ubiquitously thought of as a secondorder act. I realize that an attribution of oddness, especially with respect to a fledgling notion like consciousness in the seventeenth century, is not the best argument. I suggest, though, that there is another problem that hits closer to home. LoLordo’s interpretation seems to have its own difficulty with how to account for the content of consciousness, for it runs afoul of a passage explaining the production of ideas of sensation. LoLordo (2012: 113–20) argues that the difference between reflection as consciousness and reflection as a source of ideas is that the latter requires attention and results in lasting ideas of reflection, namely those that are retained in memory. That is, attention (or, what is the same, “taking notice”) makes the difference between having lasting ideas and mental content like the “obscure Notions” we have of our own thinking in II.i.25. It distinguishes reflection as a source of ideas. And because of the symmetry in her explanations of sensation and reflection, attention must play the same role in sensation.\n",

Here is what Locke says about the role of attention in sensation: How often may a man observe in himself, that whilst his Mind is intently employ’d in the contemplation of some Objects; and curiously surveying some Ideas that are there, it takes no notice of impressions of sounding Bodies, made upon the Organ of hearing, with the same alteration, that uses to be for the producing of the Idea of the Sound? A sufficient impulse there may be on the Organ; but it not reaching the Observation of the Mind, there follows no perception: And though the motion, that uses to produce the Idea of Sound, be made in the Ear, yet no Sound is heard. Want of Sensation in this case, is not through any defect in the Organ, or that the Man’s Ears are less affected, than at other times, when he does hear: but that which uses to produce the Idea, though conveyed in by the usual Organ, not being taken notice of in the Understanding, and so imprinting no Idea in the Mind, there follows no Sensation.

In a contribution published online in the Mod Squad Blog (June 2013), LoLordo replies to my objection by saying: I’m not sure about this: presumably attention, like lastingness, comes in degrees. Moreover, I worry that Locke calls on attention to do too much. But I think this is a problem for Locke, not for my interpretation of him.

            "Children have vague perceptions of their own mental states before they are able to reflect.38 According to Locke, even a fetus, to some extent, perceives what goes on in its mind: That a Foetus in a Mother’s Womb, differs not much from a State of a Vegetable; but passes the greatest part of its time without Perception or Thought, doing very little, but sleep in a Place, where it needs not seek for Food, and is surrounded with a Liquor, always equally soft, and near of the same temper; where the Eyes have no Light, and the Ears so shut up, are not very susceptible of Sounds; and where there is little or no variety, or change of Objects, to move the senses. (II.I.21)\n",

            "The fact that a fetus passes most of its time without perception or thought suggests that it spends at least a small part of its time with perception or thought. The body, even of a fetus, although protected by the surrounding fluid, is passive to impressions made on it from the motions of external bodies. Perhaps the fetus can hear sounds or feel vibrations. Because the fetus has at least some perception, it must have at least some ideas of sensation, since perception just is the having of ideas in a mind.39\n",

            "Moreover, although Locke does not say specifically that fetuses have “obscure Notions,” his view would imply that fetuses must be conscious. Because we cannot be wholly ignorant of what we do when we think, the fetus, when it engages in the “Perception or Thought” necessary for having ideas of sensation, has a vague “obscure Notion,” or consciousness, that it is thinking. It is conscious it is having mental states despite its inability to reflect.\n",

            "There is, finally, one small point to make with respect to the passage describing reflection in II.i.4. At the end of the passage Locke says that mental operations, “which we being conscious of, and observing in ourselves,” furnish ideas to the understanding in reflection.

But the difficulty with this interpretation is that, again, one might\n",

So, instead, I suggest the passage is better interpreted in the following way: We are conscious that we are having mental operations prior to reflecting on them and thus producing ideas of reflection— this just is Locke’s view that we are conscious of all that passes in the mind—of all of our own thinking. And when we “observe in ourselves” (reflect on) those (conscious) operations, we end up perceiving (producing) ideas of reflection that have those conscious operations as their objects. Of course, we will also be conscious that we are having those acts of reflection. Remember that mental operations are always about ideas, and they are in the mind only as they involve ideas originating in sensation or reflection. So, every mental operation that passes in the mind is a perception of some sort, and because consciousness is an internal constituent of all perception, we are conscious that we are perceiving prior to reflecting on and having ideas of those mental operations. Therefore, this passage is actually consistent with the interpretation offered here: because being conscious is an intrinsic feature of perception and not structurally identical to perception, consciousness can be distinguished from reflection without contradicting Locke’s empiricist principle.\n",

Although reflection and sensation are different in that having ideas of sensation involves perception as the result of bodily impressions and having ideas of reflection involves perception of mental operations, both sensation and reflection produce ideas. In contrast, consciousness does not produce ideas, but at the same time, consciousness, like sensation and reflection, has something to do with perception. So, how does Locke see the relation of consciousness to perception?\n",

            "however, treat all three in various places in II.i. Let us review three of these passages concerning first, sensation, then, reflection, and last, consciousness: If it shall be demanded then, When a Man begins to have any Ideas? I think, the true Answer is, When he first has a Sensation. For since there appear not to be any Ideas in the Mind, before the Senses have conveyed any in, I conceive that Ideas in the Understanding, are coeval with Sensation; which is such an Impression or Motion, made in some part of the Body, as produces some Perception in the Understanding. ’Tis about these Impressions made on our Senses by outward Objects, that the Mind seems first to employ it self in such Operations as we call Perception, Remembring, Consideration, Reasoning, etc. (II.i.23, my emphasis in bold)\n",
            "\n",
            "The other Fountain, from which Experience furnisheth the Understanding with Ideas, is the Perception of the Operations of our own Minds within us, as it is employ’d about the Ideas it has got; which Operations, when the Soul comes to reflect on, and consider, do furnish the Understanding with another set of Ideas, which could not be had from things without: and such are, Perception, Thinking, Doubting, Believing, Reasoning, Knowing, Willing, and all the different actings of our own Minds; which we being conscious of, and observing in our selves, do from these receive into our understandings, as distinct Ideas, as we do from Bodies affecting our Senses. (II.i.4, my emphasis in bold)\n",
            "\n",
            "For ’tis altogether as intelligible to say, that a body is extended without parts, as that any thing thinks without being conscious of it, or perceiving, that it does so. They who talk thus, may, with as much reason, if it be necessary to their Hypothesis, say that a man is always hungry, but that he does not always feel it: Whereas Hunger consists in that very sensation, as thinking consists in being conscious that one thinks. If they say that a Man is always conscious to himself of thinking; I ask how they know it? Consciousness is the Perception of what passes in a Man’s own Mind. (II.i.19, my emphasis in bold) Note that in the passage on sensation (II.i.23) and in the one on reflection (II.i.4) Locke’s explanation focuses on the production of ideas or the furnishing of ideas in the understanding either by sensation or reflection. In sensation, an impression on the body caused by an external object “produces some Perception in the Understanding” (II.i.23). Presumably, the motions from the impression on the body travel through the nervous system to the mind, where they produce in the understanding a perception of an idea of the external object. That is the process by which we gain ideas of sensation. In reflection, the mind turns in on the ideas (mostly) from sensation it already has and perceives the thinking operations involved in having those ideas. When the mind “comes to reflect on and consider” those ideas it already has, the operations of the mind “do furnish the Understanding with another set of Ideas,” namely, ideas of reflection. The ideas “furnished” to the mind in reflection are the result of perceptions of the operations of our minds as they are “employ’d about the Ideas it [the mind] has got.” It is clear from these two passages that sensation and reflection are mental acts or operations that furnish or produce additional ideas in the understanding.41\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "Rather, to explain the relation consciousness bears to perception, Locke employs an analogy, primarily to the relation between hunger and feeling hungry. Although the analogy is not strict, it suggests that Locke understands the relation consciousness bears to perception as having similar aspects to the relation feeling hungry bears to being hungry. Being hungry, Locke says, consists in feeling hungry: what it is like for me to be hungry is not additional to having hunger.\n",

Analogously, there is more to hunger, say, physiological aspects, than just feeling hungry. On this model, consciousness—as non-productive of ideas and as analogous to the points made about hunger—is best explained as something different from perception but internal to it, perhaps, as my experience of myself as thinking.42\n",
            "\n",
            "In many places, Locke seems to indicate that consciousness is self-consciousness or some sort of experience of our thinking as our own. The following examples make up just a few of many: “Every Man being conscious to himself, That he thinks . . .” (II.i.1); “If the Soul doth think in a sleeping Man, without being conscious of it, I ask, whether, during such thinking, it has any Pleasure or Pain, or be capable of Happiness or Misery? . . . For to be happy or miserable without being conscious of it, seems to me utterly inconsistent and impossible” (II.i.11), and “For since consciousness always accompanies thinking, and ’tis that, that makes everyone to be, what he calls self; and thereby distinguishes himself from all other thinking things” (II.xxvii.9).

            "\n",
            "At this point one might wonder about the implications of this interpretation for animals. Locke is clear that animals have perception: “This faculty of Perception, seems to be that, which puts the distinction betwixt the animal Kingdom, and the inferior parts of Nature” (II.ix.11). Plants, on the other hand do not have perception; the sensitivity of plants to the motions of other bodies, Locke says, “is all bare Mechanism” (II.ix.11). But if animals have perception, then on my interpretation they are conscious and even to some degree self-conscious. Although this might sound odd, Locke does not seem to think so. On the contrary, he seems to think that by and large the mental capacities of animals are like those of human beings, except in matter of degree: Perception, I believe, is, in some degree, in all sorts of Animals; though in some possibly, the Avenues, provided by Nature for the reception of Sensations, are so few, and the perception they are received with, so obscure and dull, that it comes extremely short of the quickness and variety of Sensations, which is in other Animals: but yet it is sufficient for, and wisely adapted to, the state and condition of that sort of Animals, who are thus made: So that the Wisdom and Goodness of the Maker plainly appears in all the Parts of this stupendious Fabrick, and all the several degrees and ranks of Creatures in it. (II.ix.12)\n",
            "\n",
            "Moreover, sensation is not the only kind of mental activity Locke assigns to other animals. He thinks they may also “compare” ideas, at least ideas having to do with “sensible circumstances annexed to the Objects themselves” (II.xi.5), and although he doubts they are able to “compound” simple ideas into complex ones, animals are able to “take in, and retain together several Combinations of simple Ideas, as possibly the Shape, Smell, and Voice of his Master . . . [as] so many marks whereby he knows him” (II.xi.7). Locke has similar doubts that animals are able to “enlarge” ideas. Where Locke draws the line, though, and where he thinks he actually can do more than merely conjecture, is when it comes to abstraction. Non-human animals have no capacity for general ideas, so any mental operations they do have will be about particular ideas: “If it may be doubted, Whether Beasts compound and enlarge their Ideas that way, to any degree: This, I think, I may be positive in, That the power of Abstracting is not at all in them; and that the having of general Ideas, is that which puts the perfect distinction betwixt Men and Brutes” (II.xi.10).\n",
            "\n",
            "Importantly, when it comes to the mental activities of animals and the degree to which they mimic human beings, Locke is willing to assign more to animals than one might think. “For if they have any Ideas at all, and are not bare Machins (as some would have them) we cannot deny them to have some Reason” (II.xi.11). Exactly what Locke means by “reason” here is not exactly clear. Given the passages above, perhaps Locke, like Leibniz (1996: 50), thinks that animals are “sheer empirics,” able to draw inductive conclusions on the basis of the regularity of their collections of\n",
            "\n",
            "simple ideas. At the very least we can see Locke’s attribution of some form of reasoning to animals as consistent with his critique of essentialism generally as well as with his critique of Descartes’s explanation of psychological activity as dependent on an immortal soul or substance. And if non-human animals have simple ideas of sensation and they are able to manipulate those ideas in various ways that add variety and richness to their mental lives, I suspect it is not a great leap to say that they are also (to varying degrees) conscious and so self-conscious. Remember that as I have described it, consciousness is pre-reflective. So being self-conscious on this view does not imply that non-human animals can have full-fledged ideas of themselves or a conceptual understanding of themselves. That would require reflection or abstraction. Abstraction, Locke denies to animals. He does not say specifically that nonhuman animals do not reflect, but if reflection is not present in young children, it is reasonable to think it is not present in other animals. Moreover, I do not believe it is far-fetched to think that many animals have some sense of their thinking as their own—that they pre-reflectively assign whatever ideas they have to themselves.43\n",

In addition, if we read Locke as seeing consciousness as a reflexive and self-referential perception internal to ordinary perception, namely the awareness of ourselves as perceiving ideas, we can make sense of the independent role given to consciousness in those accounts in which Locke seems to employ consciousness.44 Although I will have much more to say about all the ways in which consciousness is employed in the Essay, for now consider just Locke’s analysis of memory.\n",

            "assertion that “to remember is to perceive any thing with memory, or with a consciousness, that it was known or perceived before.” This strongly suggests that Locke intends consciousness to contribute something to the perception of an idea that has been revived from memory. Perhaps it contributes the awareness that I have perceived the idea before, which makes the difference in my experience between reviving an idea and other ways of perceiving an idea, say, my experience in sensing (perceiving an idea of sensation). In perceiving an idea I have had before, I am conscious that I am reviving an idea, namely experiencing it as remembered or as from memory.45\n",

Indeed, we would have to say that consciousness is a perception of the idea “had the idea before.” But this interpretation—that consciousness can have an idea as an object—results in the problem that Locke’s account of memory violates the empiricist principle. Moreover, as mentioned at the outset, the I.iv.20 discussion of memory is in the service of an argument against innate ideas, namely against the view that we have ideas that do not originate in sensation and reflection. So, Locke cannot be thinking that the feature that allows for an awareness that makes a memory a memory rather than an idea of sensation is a kind of perception that has an idea as an object, since there is no explanation where that idea originates consistent with Locke’s empiricism. On the view that consciousness is a special kind of awareness internal to ordinary perception we have an account that avoids these problems altogether. That is, consciousness can be the awareness of the perception of an idea as a reviving (or as from memory) without having to say that that awareness is the result of perceiving an additional idea.\n",

It is the experience or awareness of my thoughts and actions as mine—my awareness of myself as thinking and acting—that constitutes the criterion by which I can claim to be having those thoughts and engaging in those actions. This implicit grasp of ourselves as so perceiving a thought or performing an action is made explicit to us when we turn our present attention to those thoughts and actions in reflection. And when our past and present thinking and acting are brought into relief by an act of reflection we become explicitly aware of ourselves as thinking and acting in both the past and the present, that is, that “it is the same self now it was then; and ’tis by the same self with this present one that now reflects on it, that that Action was done” (II.xxvii.9, my emphasis in bold).47\n",

A thorough investigation of the experience of our own thinking reveals no justification for the claim that we have innate ideas. Whether or not Locke has considered all the ways in which ideas can be innate is a good question.1 In spite of the scholarship’s answer to this query, however, certainly Locke thinks he has sufficiently argued the case, and so draws the conclusion that all ideas must have their origin in experience: in sensation and reflection.\n",

The understanding is the power of perception, and the will is the power of volition. Therefore, acts of the understanding (sensing, reflecting, discerning, comparing, knowing, believing, etc.) are all perceptions.3 Moreover, as already argued, all perceptions include self-consciousness, and as will become clear in a moment, all perceptions include ideas.\n",

I take passages like this to be less careful ways of saying that although we can conceptually distinguish acts of perception from ideas, in experience we never have ideas without acts of perception or acts of perception without ideas.6 Putting this issue aside, it is not at all clear that Locke himself was concerned to figure out the nature of ideas. When questioned about it by Stillingfleet, he responds, So that supposing ideas real spiritual things ever so much, if they are neither substances nor modes, let them be what they will, I am no more instructed in their nature, than when I am told they are perceptions, such as I find them. (Works, ix.220) In spite of Locke’s lack of concern, it is probably helpful to clarify the way in which I interpret Lockean ideas. Locke seems to state pretty clearly that ideas are some sort of mental objects. Textual support for this conclusion includes I.i.8, where Locke says about ‘idea,’ “It being that Term, which, I think, serves best to stand for whatsoever is the Object of the Understanding when a Man thinks”; II.viii.8, where we find, “Whatsoever the Mind perceives in it self, or is the immediate object of Perception, Thought, or Understanding”; and IV.xxi.4, where we have, “For since the Things, the Mind contemplates, are none of them, besides it self, present to the Understanding, ’tis necessary that something else, as a Sign or Representation of the thing it considers, should be present to it.” Passages like these lead us to think that ideas are mental objects that mediate between us and an external world.\n",

            "Because consciousness is an intrinsic feature of all acts of perception, we are conscious of all of our ideas—that we are perceiving them.

At the very least the complexity consists in an act of perception, an idea perceived, and consciousness that I am perceiving the idea.\n",

            "The fourth and final book of the Essay extends the account of the origin and generation of ideas to an explanation of how perceptions of ideas can lead to knowledge and certainty. Knowledge, Locke defines as “the perception of the\n",

            "\n",
            "Where this Perception is, there is Knowledge, and where it is not, there, though we may fancy, guess, or believe, yet we always come short of Knowledge” (IV.i.2).8 As the result of having ideas in the mind, we are able to perceive (know) how they agree or disagree. Locke can be seen to confirm his definition of knowledge in his claims that all knowledge is propositional. In II.xxxiii.19, for example, we find, “our Knowledge, which all consists in Propositions,” and again in the Correspondence with Stillingfleet (Locke, 1823, iv: 357), Locke says, “Everything which we either know or believe, is some proposition.” In addition, in the IV.v.1 definition of truth, Locke is clear that the “joining or separating of Signs” whose agreement or disagreement constitutes truth “is what by another name, we call Proposition.”9 Agreements (or disagreements) of ideas, the perception of which constitutes knowledge, are arranged into four categories: “1. Identity, or Diversity. 2. Relation, 3. Co-existence, or necessary connexion, [and] 4. Real Existence” (IV.i.3). “Identity,” Locke seems to limit to knowing our own ideas as they are in the mind. It is to perceive that each idea agrees with itself, although what Locke seems really to mean is that we know of each idea “what it is” (IV.i.4) or that “it is as [we] perceive it to be” (IV.ii.1). Knowing that two ideas are “diverse” is to know that “one is not the other” (IV.i.4). “Relation” is a very broad category of agreements comprising everything that does not fall into one of the other three categories. Locke usually turns to mathematical relations as examples, but we can include knowing any sort of relation between our ideas.10 Knowing an agreement of “necessary co-existence” in the same subject is a type of knowledge particularly about substances—that some quality of a substance as represented by an idea is necessarily joined by some other quality as represented by a different idea (IV.i.6). Finally, we know only three “real existences”: the existence of ourselves, of God, and of particular external objects (IV.i.7).\n",

            "Although when push comes to shove Locke thinks that all four categories of agreements are relations, he tells us that some agreements are so “peculiar . . . that they deserve well to be considered under distinct heads, and not under Relation in general, since they are such different grounds of affirmation and negation” (IV.i.7).\n",
            "\n",
            "That is, Locke could have said that to know an agreement of ideas is simply to know a relation of ideas and left it at that. But then what I take to be a meaningful “peculiarity . . . of the different grounds of affirmation and negation” would have\n",
            "\n",
            "been glossed over. Locke mentions only identity and co-existence as having this peculiarity. As with the agreement of identity, I also take the agreement of real existence with respect to knowing our own existence and knowing the existence of external objects to be somewhat peculiar. One, but not the only, reason to think that knowing particular real existences is like knowing a particular idea is that Locke refers to ideas as particular “real existences”: “Every Man’s Reasoning and Knowledge, is only about the Ideas existing in his own Mind, which are truly, every one of them, particular Existences: and our Knowledge and reasoning about other Things, is only as they correspond with those our particular Ideas” (IV.xvii.8).\n",
            "\n",
            "The peculiarity consists, as Locke says, in the “grounds of affirmation and negation,” that is, in the way in which the agreement is constituted and perceived. Having any knowledge, whether peculiar or not, for Locke, is the result of perceiving agreeing ideas. This means that ideas are in the mind simultaneously. Examples of having simultaneous ideas in the mind include, but are not limited to, cases of the composition of simple ideas to create complex ones, cases of reflection, and cases of comparing or juxtaposing ideas. In the mental operation of “COMPOSITION” the mind “puts together several of those simple ones [ideas] it has received from Sensation and Reflection, and combines them into complex ones” (II.xi.6). “Reflection,” Locke explains, “is the Perception of the Operations of our own Minds within us, as it is employed about the Ideas it has got” (II.i.4), which implies that the reflective perception is in the mind at the same time as the perception that is its object. Additionally, in comparing ideas “the Mind so considers one thing, that it does, as it were, bring it to, and set it by another, and carry its view from one t’other” (II.xxv.1). In all three cases, ideas are perceived in the mind simultaneously, that is, there is a complex perceptual state.11 And when there are ideas in the mind simultaneously and there are agreements between those ideas, we can know those agreements.12 We might say that those agreements are presented to us in consciousness. That is, insofar we know an agreement of ideas, we are conscious of ourselves as knowing it.\n",
            "\n",
            "My interpretation of Locke’s theory of knowledge includes two claims: one is novel; the other is not. First, the non-novel claim: knowing an agreement intuitively (or non-inferentially) need not require a mental act in addition to the complex perceptual state wherein we find the agreeing ideas. That is, we can have non-inferential knowledge (perceive an agreement) just in virtue of attending to whatever constitutes the agreement. There is no need for an additional mental act.13\n",

            "As I have argued, perceptions of ideas are complex mental states that include, at the very least, a perceptual act, an idea perceived, and the consciousness of myself as perceiving. And when there are simultaneous perceptions of ideas, there is an even more complex mental state in which we are conscious that we are perceiving multiple ideas. Furthermore, if there are ideas in my mind simultaneously, then, without any additional act of the mind, we can know intuitively (be conscious of) any agreements therein.14 I will have more to say about this in part I of this chapter. In addition, that we have simultaneous ideas and we are conscious we are perceiving each idea results in unity of consciousness in perceiving more than one idea. I will have more to say about the unity of consciousness and the work it does for Locke in chapters four and five.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now for the novel claim: I will argue that there are other aspects of mental content that can play a role in constituting an agreement of ideas. My proposal is that we can see the peculiarity in cases of knowing an idea, knowing our own existence, and knowing the existence of an external object as due to two factors.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, part of the peculiarity is due to the fact that in these cases my knowledge is of a particular individual thing. That is, I know a particular truth as opposed to a general one. Although I think these instances of knowledge are consistent with the general definition of knowledge, it is not so easy to see how. Second, and relatedly, part of the peculiarity in knowing the agreements constituting our knowledge of the identity of an idea, of our own existence, and of the existence of external objects is due to the complexity of our perceptual states. For example, knowing an idea and knowing that we exist depend on the first-personal character of consciousness as a constituent element in a more complex mental state resulting from the perception of an idea. Because this first-personal character is itself an element of the complex mental state, it can play a role in constituting an agreement. We will also see that Locke has consciousness playing a role in the agreement in an instance of knowing the existence of something external to me, but it is different from what we find in the other two cases. But here, too, it is because of the complexity of our perceptual states that we are able to perceive the agreement constituting what Locke calls “sensitive knowledge” of the existence of particular finite beings. In none of the cases, though, must the account violate Locke’s definition of knowledge as the perception of an agreement of ideas.\n",
            "\n",
            "One might wonder why I am not considering the “peculiarity” in knowing agreements of “necessary co-existence in the same subject.” First, according to Locke, we have virtually no knowledge of this category except insofar as particular collections of defending a “proto-Fregean” account in order to avoid some of these difficulties. Marušić (2014: 263–78) provides a recent very compelling argument against the “proto-Fregean” view and in defense of the “one-act” view.\n",

            "simple ideas make up our complex ideas of substances. If this is the extent of our knowledge, then it is not hard to make the case that in perceiving a complex idea, say, of gold, I am conscious of the simple ideas composing it. But knowledge of necessary connection is much more than that. It is knowing that there is a necessary dependence of one idea on another, which requires knowing the metaphysical relation between insensible bodies and the metaphysical dependence of ideas on the powers of those related bodies to produce them. Locke is clear that such knowledge is very scarce: This, how weighty and considerable a part soever of Humane Science, is yet very narrow, and scarce any at all. The reason whereof is that the simple Ideas whereof our complex Ideas of Substances are made up, are, for the most part such, as carry with them, in their own Nature, no visible necessary connexion, or inconsistency with any other simple Ideas, whose co-existence with them we would inform ourselves about.

Indeed, some few of the primary Qualities have a necessary dependence, and visible connexion one with another, as Figure necessarily supposes Extension, receiving or communicating Motion by impulse, supposes Solidity” (IV.iii.14). Locke does not provide any further description of these instances of intuitively knowing a necessary co-existence. I suspect when he says we know it only by experience he means that when we perceive an idea of figure, we always also perceive an idea of extension. We cannot perceive the one idea without the other; perceiving their coexistence is psychologically unavoidable. Perhaps this is some of the peculiarity of the way of perceiving the agreement. If so, then, as we will see, these two cases of knowing a necessary co-existence, namely the psychological unavoidability of the two ideas simultaneously together in the mind and thus the perception of their agreement, is fully compatible with my interpretation of how we have the other peculiar forms of knowledge.\n",

            "Intuitive knowledge is an immediate perception of an agreement, where demonstration requires an intervening idea to show the agreement.

Moreover, although “where-ever the Mind perceives the Agreement or Disagreement of any Ideas,” says Locke, “there be certain knowledge” (IV.ii.2), not all perceptions of agreements carry the same degree of certainty. Demonstrative knowledge is a little less certain than intuitive knowledge, and sensitive knowledge (of the existence of external objects) falls somewhere in between demonstrative\n",

Attributions of certain knowledge are generally reserved only for intuition and demonstration, what we might call “knowledge proper.” Given the Cartesian skeptical concerns, Locke’s representational theory of perception, and his goal of discovering the limits of human understanding, it is surprising that he would want to include representations of external world objects as providing “sensitive” knowledge. More naturally one would conclude, as some do, that what Locke calls sensitive knowledge is really only a high degree of probability. In part III of this chapter, I will argue that Locke’s inclusion of sensitive knowledge as having a degree of certainty appropriate to his understanding of knowledge is consistent with his reasons for why there is a difference in the certainty of intuitive and demonstrative knowledge.\n",
            "\n",
            "Let me also add that Locke’s account of probability, although having parallel features, is significantly different from his account of knowledge. For Locke, ideas may agree, in which case there is truth, but unless we actually perceive them to agree there is no knowledge. Therefore, in having knowledge it is the perception of the agreement that counts. If we do not perceive the agreement (either because we are unable to for lack of intervening ideas or there is not one), then the best we can do is some degree of assent to a probable judgment. “Judgment,” says Locke, “. . . is the putting Ideas together, or separating them from one another in the Mind, when their certain Agreement or Disagreement is not perceived, but presumed to be so” (IV.xiv.4). Probable judgment is taking there to be an agreement (or disagreement) when we do not actually perceive one. Moreover, there is no direct analogue between the degrees of certainty of knowledge and the degrees of assent to a probable judgment, for all cases of probability are cases of proofs. We do not immediately “presume” ideas to agree; there is always an intervening idea doing some work to bolster the presumption. “That which makes me believe,” Locke says, “is something extraneous to the thing I believe; something not evidently joined on both sides to, and so not manifestly shewing the Agreement or Disagreement of those Ideas, that are under consideration” (IV.xv.3).16 In other words, probable judgments are always inferential, which I am interpreting as the result of a mediating idea (or proposition). Only two kinds of grounds or justification are used in probabilistic reasoning: “First, The conformity of any thing with our own Knowledge, Observation, and Experience. Secondly, The testimony of others, vouching their\n",
            "\n",
            "Observation and Experience” (IV.xv.4). The intervening idea justifying the presumption of an agreement is our own past experience or testimony of the experience of others. Factors attesting to the reliability of the testimony of another, things like the integrity of the testifier, the skill of the witness, whether there is any contrary experience, etc., justify the degree to which we assent to the belief. And degrees of belief range from assurance and confidence to conjecture, wavering, doubt, distrust, and disbelief (IV.xvi.6–9).\n",
            "\n",
            "Importantly also, for Locke, there is an involuntary aspect to both belief and knowledge—something over which we have no control. When we perceive an agreement, we do not choose to be certain, nor do we voluntarily assign ourselves a degree of assent given the evidence for a probable judgment. We just see the agreement (the truth) and experience certainty; in probable judgment we just naturally presume the proposition to be true to a degree warranted by how we are affected by the evidence.17 This is not to say that we have no epistemic responsibility when it comes to what we believe. We do, and in fact Locke’s project to discover the limits of knowledge would in some ways be in vain were we to have no control at all over what we believe. Our responsibility is to seek knowledge (the perception of agreeing or disagreeing ideas), and when we fail to achieve it, to recognize that much of what we claim to know really only reaches various levels of probability depending on the reliability of the evidence.18\n",

            "Why then would he think we have knowledge of the external world, especially since drawing the proper boundary between knowledge and probability is Locke’s stated task in the Essay? And what does all of this have to do with consciousness? I suggest that Locke’s “Historical, plain Method” of providing an account of the facts of experience leads him to his controversial conclusions concerning the status of sensitive knowledge. I argue that insofar as it reveals to us the experience of our own thinking, Locke’s introspective method is key to understanding how we have knowledge of our own ideas and ourselves (the topics of part I) and of external objects (the topic of parts II and III). Understanding the important role of our experience in perceiving ideas, as it pertains to Locke’s claims concerning how we have these various forms of knowledge, is the task of the entire chapter. Consciousness, as providing some of that experience, as we will see, plays a significant role in each case. What is more, appreciating the complexity of our mental states and that consciousness is a part of that complexity leads to an integrated account of all three of these instances of knowing particular things.

            "## PART I Knowing our own Ideas (and Ourselves) As we have just seen, at the beginning of Book IV, Of Knowledge and Probability, Locke defines knowledge as “nothing but the perception of the connexion and agreement, or disagreement and repugnancy of any of our Ideas” (IV.i.1). There are four categories of agreement: first, there is “Identity, or Diversity,” which is the agreement of an idea with itself, or its disagreement with any other idea (IV.i.4); second, there is “Co-existence . . . in the same Subject,” which is the agreement ideas of qualities have that are necessarily found together in complex ideas of substances (IV.1.6); third, there is “Real Existence,” which is knowledge of the existence of ourselves, God, and particular finite things (external objects) (IV.iii.21); and finally, there is “relation in general,” which is a catch-all category for those agreements that do not fall under the specific definitions of the other three (IV.i.5, IV.i.7). For example, mathematical relations fall into this last group, as do agreements of resemblance or size. So, knowledge is the perception of an agreement of ideas, and each of these four categories is a species of knowledge. Therefore, what we know in each case must be consistent with Locke’s definition of knowledge.\n",
            "\n",
            "When Locke describes the category of “Identity, or Diversity,” he speaks only of the intuitive knowledge we have of our own individual ideas. Knowing our own ideas is to perceive “each Idea to agree with it self, and to be what it is” (IV.i.4). In addition, he distinguishes this sort of knowledge from general maxims or propositions that express an identity relation. For example, he says: A Man infallibly knows, as soon as ever he has them in his Mind that the Ideas he calls White and Round, are the very Ideas they are, and that they are not other Ideas, which he calls Red or Square. Nor can any Maxim or Proposition in the World make him know it clearer or surer than he did before, and without any such general Rule. (IV.i.4)\n",
            "\n",
            "But if knowing a particular idea is not by virtue of perceiving a general maxim or analytic proposition, then how is it consistent with the general definition of knowledge? And what is the agreement perceived and the true proposition known?\n",

In addition, we will see that the same account leads to an explanation of how we know our own existence, namely Locke’s version of the cogito argument. In both cases, consciousness as a constituent of a more complex mental state is crucial to the explanation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another reason why we should be concerned to provide a consistent account of knowing individual ideas is that Locke sees this knowledge as having suitable epistemic perfection to be foundational (IV.viii.3, IV.vii.4). He seems to think that the intuitive knowledge of our own ideas has some sort of “immunity to error through misidentification.”21 That is, I cannot but know which ideas I am perceiving.\n",
            "\n",
            "I cannot misidentify my own ideas. This is why Locke must maintain that all ideas are perceived distinctly and why he must resort to the relation between ideas and names in order to generate any confusion in our ideas: Now every Idea a Man has, being visibly what it is, and distinct from all other Ideas but it self, that which makes it confused is, when it is such, that it may as well be called by another Name, as that which it is expressed by, the difference which keeps the Things (to be ranked under those two different Names) distinct, and makes some of them belong rather to the one, and some of them to the other of those Names, . . . and so the distinction, which was intended to be kept up by those different Names is quite lost.

            "\n",
            "One example Locke gives of having a confused idea is when I take the idea “beast with spots” to stand for a leopard, since this idea, to which I have attached the name ‘leopard,’ cannot distinguish a leopard from a lynx (a different beast with spots) (II.xxix.7).\n",

            "Similarly, in Book IV, in the first paragraph in which he discusses our knowledge of our own ideas, Locke states, “This then is the first agreement, or disagreement, which the Mind perceives in its Ideas; which it always perceives at first sight: And if there ever\n",

I am using the term (IEM) only in a very general way to showcase both the propositional nature and the kind of epistemic infallibility Locke assigns to knowledge of our own ideas. For Locke, when I know an idea, I am immune to error relative to my own first-personal identification of the idea. I cannot be wrong when I claim to know that the idea, as Locke says, “is such as . . . [I] perceive[ . . . ] it to be” (IV.ii.1).\n",

            "Right off the bat, one might object that I have conjured up an interpretive problem for Locke that does not exist. For I have conflated the perception of ideas with the perception of agreements of ideas. Consider, for example, II.xxi.5, where Locke distinguishes the three powers of perception constituting the understanding: Perception, which we make the act of the Understanding, is of three sorts: 1. The Perception of Ideas in our Minds, 2. The Perception of the signification of Signs. 3. The Perception of the Connexion or Repugnancy, Agreement or Disagreement, that there is between any of our Ideas.\n",

            "\n",
            "But this objection misses the target. First, in the very next sentence of the above passage, Locke states this: “All these [powers of perception] are attributed to the Understanding, or perceptive Power, though it be the two latter only that use allows us to say we understand” (II.xxi.5). Yet, if Locke thinks we have knowledge of individual ideas, and he includes it in Book IV (Of Knowledge in General), then he must be thinking that when we perceive an idea, we understand something constituting knowledge. So, I do not think that Locke means the power of perceiving ideas to be fully capturing his Book IV discussion of knowing an idea. Second, Locke cannot be thinking that what we understand when we know an idea is an analytic proposition (two tokens of a single idea type), for he devotes an entire chapter to explaining why these sorts of propositions are “trivial” as opposed to “instructive.” I take it that when Locke says we “understand” something, he means it to be something substantive.23 Third, Locke claims that we know the identity of “each”\n",
            "\n",
            "Locke explains that ideas are determined prior to being denominated, which is consistent with the passage above in which Locke describes confusion as not having to do with anything inherent in the perception (or knowledge) of an idea, but with the failure of terms (denominations) to distinguish a particular idea sufficiently from another similar to it.\n",

            "\n",
            "Therefore, knowing an idea seems not to be the result of perceiving two tokens of an idea type, and there is some need for an account of Locke’s claim that we have intuitive knowledge of individual ideas.\n",

            "We should also be clear, as was mentioned earlier, that knowing the identity of an idea is not the result of already knowing a general principle of identity. Locke asserts, the Mind clearly and infallibly perceives each Idea to agree with it self, and to be what it is; . . . at first view, by its natural power of Perception and Distinction. And though Men of Art have reduced this into those general Rules, What is, is; and it is impossible for the same thing to be, and not to be, for ready application in all cases, wherein there may be occasion to reflect on it; yet it is certain that the first exercise of this Faculty is about particular Ideas. (IV.i.4) Consider again that Locke is drawing a distinction between knowing our own ideas individually by the “first exercise of this Faculty [‘of Perception and Distinction’]” and an act of reason (as Locke uses the term) or reflection by which we would recognize that the individual identity fits under a general principle concerning all ideas. Not only does Locke think that we have intuitive knowledge of particular ideas, but the view I am advocating does not see Locke as requiring reason, reflection, or any other perceptual act for intuitive knowledge at all. Rather, non-inferential forms of knowledge can be conveyed as part of first-order perceptual acts. From this we can conclude, first, that I know that any idea in my mind is the idea it is, and, second, that the reason why I know the identity is in virtue of that particular perceptual state itself and not because of anything else. We can then move on to answer these next two questions concerning our knowledge of our own ideas: How can we know these agreements as the result of perceiving an idea, and what is the nature of the proposition known? From what I have been arguing, crucial to the story is that perceptions of ideas are complex mental states with constituent elements.\n",

            "extension).” Bolton then concentrates on establishing (3) in terms of Locke’s theory of how ideas represent things external to us. As will be clear soon, I will distinguish the knowledge in (3) from what we have in (1) and (2) and then focus on the latter. I am also arguing that consistent with Locke’s other commitments, our knowledge of our own ideas (what we have in (1) and (2)) is propositional, although I do not think Bolton would deny this. See also Ayers (1991: 98), who acknowledges that “on Locke’s view the perception of the identity or diversity of ideas reduces to the ‘discerning’ or distinguishing of a single idea or two different ideas.” He continues, “Since we cannot have ideas without distinguishing them, the potentiality for a kind of propositional knowledge is bound up with the very having of ideas.” In a comparison of Locke with Descartes, Loeb (1981: 54) claims that for both “we have intuitive knowledge of propositions about the content of our present sensory states.” I take Loeb to be saying that knowing our own ideas, for Locke, is a form of substantive propositional knowledge.\n",

            "The task, then, is to provide an account of how we have propositional knowledge of individual ideas consistent with Locke’s theory of knowledge generally, and in so doing also reveal the important role consciousness plays. As mentioned earlier, there has been almost no treatment of this issue in the scholarship. There are, however, two exceptions. Lex Newman (2007), in a footnote responds to this passage in Locke: Every one finds in himself, that he knows the Ideas he has; That he knows also, when any one is in his Understanding, and what it is; And that when more than one are there he knows them distinctly and unconfusedly one from another. Which always being so, (it being impossible but that he should perceive what he perceives,) he can never be in doubt when any Idea is in his Mind, that it is there, and is that Idea it is; and that two distinct Ideas, when they are in his Mind, are there, and are not one and the same Idea. (IV.vii.4)\n",
            "\n",
            "Here Locke distinguishes three different kinds of knowledge falling under the category of identity and diversity: (1) we know “when any one [idea] is in the understanding,” which Locke glosses as “that it is there”; (2) we know “what it [the idea] is,” namely that it “is the Idea it is”; and (3) when more than one idea is in the mind, we know that they “are not one and the same idea.” Since we are concerned only with knowing the identity of an idea and not its diversity from other ideas, I will consider only (1) and (2): knowing that an idea is in the mind and knowing what the idea is. Here is how Newman explains those agreements: Locke writes that a man “can never be in doubt when any Idea is in his Mind, that it is there,” explaining this by appeal to “it being impossible but that he should perceive what he perceives” (E IV.vii.4). But this leaves unclear how such truths count as agreements between ideas. An explanation is suggested in connection with his Book II discussion of perception: “What Perception is, everyone will know better by reflecting on what he does himself, when he sees, hears, feels, etc.”—that is, “reflects on what passes in his own Mind” (E II.ix.2: 143). This implies that the general idea of perception subsumes all manner of occurring ideas, thereby suggesting how to formulate the relevant agreement. Suppose a sensation of red is occurring in my mind. To know that that idea is presently occurring—that it is in the present contents of consciousness—is to perceive an agreement between that idea and my general idea of perception. (To know, in addition, that the occurring sensation is of red is to perceive, in addition, an agreement between that idea of sensation and my general idea of red.)25 Newman argues that the agreement in knowing (1) is between the idea (any idea) and a general idea of perception, and in perceiving that agreement we know “that an idea is presently occurring” (my emphasis). Knowing (2) “that the occurring sensation is of red,” namely what the idea is, Newman argues, consists in perceiving an agreement between the “idea of sensation and my general idea of red.” Although I concur that when we know an idea, we seem to know both that the idea is in the mind and what the idea is (as stated in the IV.vii.4 passage), here are some reasons to be suspicious that the agreements are as Newman describes them. First, Newman’s view requires\n",
            "\n",
            "that we already have several general or abstract ideas before we can have knowledge of the identity of an idea. So, prior to knowing the identity of my idea red, I must have a general idea of perception, and I must have a general idea of red. But this conflicts with Locke’s claim in the rest of the passage from IV.vii.4 that we know the identity of each and every idea just upon perceiving it—that it is “the first Act of the Mind, . . . to know every one of its Ideas by it self.” We find virtually the same statement in IV.i.4: First, as to the first sort of agreement or disagreement, viz. identity or diversity. It is the first act of the mind, when it has any sentiments or ideas at all, to perceive its ideas; and so far as it perceives them, to know each what it is, and thereby also to perceive their difference, and that one is not another. This is so absolutely necessary, that without it there could be no knowledge, no reasoning, no imagination, no distinct thoughts at all. (IV.i.4)\n",
            "\n",
            "Clearly implied here is that we know the identity of an idea, say, the idea red, prior to having generated an abstract idea of red or even an abstract idea of perception. In addition, abstracting ideas requires a higher-order mental act that is absent in young children. Newman’s interpretation would lead to the odd conclusion that young children have no first-order knowledge that they are having ideas, nor what those ideas are. Or to accommodate that children do have knowledge of their own ideas, it would be suggestive of there being innate ideas of perception and of red that are already in the mind to be compared. But we know what Locke has to say about innate ideas. This, on top of Locke’s clear statement that “the first Act of the Mind, . . . to know every one of its Ideas by it self,” leads me to conclude that Locke must have something different in mind.\n",

            "Another exception is Nicholas Wolterstorff (1996: 20–1), who argues that contrary to his “official” position, Locke “actually” held the view that we know our own ideas, mental acts, and perhaps ourselves as constituents of facts prior to propositions. “Locke’s official doctrine [is] that, from among all the facts that there are, those of which one is directly aware consist of ideas-in-relation; it was also his doctrine that propositions consist of ideas-in-relation” (1996: 20). But “Locke’s actual view, as distinguished from his official view, was that the facts available to one for one’s ‘perception’ have not only one’s own ideas as their constituents but also one’s mental acts, and perhaps one’s self ” (1996: 21).

In section 3.I.5, I argue that Locke’s version of the cogito argument (intuitively knowing our own existence) is an analogous case. In section 3.I.6, I show why Locke’s failure adequately to account for perceptual error is not harmful to the claim that we cannot be mistaken about our own ideas. Finally, in section 3.I.7, I consider a possible textual objection to my claim that we can have knowledge in virtue of perceiving individual ideas.

            "As argued earlier, ideas are the immediate objects of perception. But it is still a question what we are thinking about when we have ideas in our minds. Many have argued for what can be roughly called an “externalist” theory of representation in Locke.26 Without delving into the details of different interpretations, the general claim is that what we are thinking about when we have sensory ideas in our minds is the external causes of those ideas. Locke’s treatment of the inverted spectrum case in the II.xxxii chapter on the truth of ideas can be seen as good support for the view: Neither would it carry any imputation of Falshood to our simple Ideas, if by the different Structure of our Organs, it were so ordered, That the same Object should produce in several Men’s Minds different Ideas at the same time; v.g. if the Idea, that a Violet produced in one Man’s Mind by his Eyes, were the same that a Marigold produced in another Man’s, and vice versa. For since this could never be known: because one Man’s Mind could never pass into another Man’s Body, to perceive, what Appearances were produced by those Organs; neither the Ideas hereby, nor the Names, would be at all confounded, or any Falshood be in either. For\n",

Moreover, that one person’s idea yellow appears not the same as another’s does not imply that anyone has a false idea. Such a view about the way in which ideas represent should lead us to think that what we are thinking about when we are having simple ideas is the causes of those ideas and not the intrinsic (apparent) features of the ideas. Thus, ideas can be seen as something like “blank effects” of their causes.27 But if what we are thinking about when we have ideas is the causes of the ideas and not the ideas themselves, then it seems difficult to make sense of Locke’s claims that we know our own ideas. That is, what we know is the idea itself, not its cause.28\n",

            "One way to circumvent this problem is to read Locke’s account of representation slightly differently. Gábor Forrai (2005: 46) argues that Locke’s theory should be “construed in content-theoretical terms.” The main thrust of the content theory is that we should distinguish the object of thinking (what we are thinking about) from the content of thinking (the way of conceiving the object of thinking): The crucial points of this interpretation are as follows. (1) Whereas the content-theory distinguishes between the object of thought, and its content, the way the object is conceived, Locke does not make this distinction explicitly, but he tacitly relies on it. He uses “idea” to stand for pieces of intentional content. (2) [Locke] is an externalist with regard to simple ideas in the following, minimal sense. The existence of simple ideas, in the sense of intentional contents, implies the existence of the objects we conceive when we have simple ideas.

Knowing an idea is the result of the relation between the different contents of my thinking when I perceive an idea, not with the object thought about. Such a view is consistent with having knowledge on the basis of the introspectable features of what is presented in the mind without having to give up that ideas also represent their causes. As we will see, the perception of an idea has a structural complexity resulting in intuitive knowledge of the idea: the agreement is presented to us in virtue of our experience of the introspectable features of perceptions of ideas.30 Perceptions of ideas, for Locke, turn out to be propositional states.\n",

            "### 3.I.2 Perceptions of Ideas Convey Knowledge In order that we can know an idea insofar as we perceive it, we must be able to have knowledge as the result of that perception. Two pieces of this puzzle have already been mentioned. First, for Locke, perceptions of ideas are complex propositional states in which there is more than just the idea perceived. Second, in order to have intuitive knowledge all that is required is that the constituents of the agreement are before the mind. In this section, I provide argumentation establishing this latter point more clearly, especially as it pertains to knowing our ideas. Once we see that agreements can be known without having to engage in an additional mental act, the door is opened to understanding how we can have knowledge as internal to the perception of an idea.\n",

            "To make the case that we have knowledge as the result of the complexity in perceiving an idea, let us start with Locke’s first statement concerning knowing the identity of an idea: First, As to the first sort of Agreement or Disagreement, viz. Identity, or Diversity. ’Tis the first Act of the Mind, when it has any Sentiments or Ideas at all, to perceive its Ideas; and so far as it perceives them, to know each what it is, and thereby also to perceive their difference, and that one is not another. This is so absolutely necessary, that without it there could be no Knowledge, no Reasoning, no Imagination, no distinct Thoughts at all. (IV.i.4)\n",

            "It is important, first, to acknowledge that in this passage Locke appears to be saying that I have intuitive knowledge of individual ideas. Insofar as I perceive an idea I “know each what it is,” and by knowing the identity of each idea, “thereby” I am able to know that it is diverse from any other.31 And if I could not be sure of the ideas I perceive, then I would not be able to know anything else.32 Similarly, in the passage\n",
            "\n",

Note, however, that in IV.ix.3, a passage cited earlier in chapter two, Locke states that we have another form of intuitive knowledge on the basis of perceiving an idea: “In every Act of Sensation, Reasoning, or Thinking,” he says, “we are conscious to our selves of our own being; and in this Matter, come not short of the highest degree of Certainty.” So there is clear textual evidence in the Essay that Locke thinks we have at least two forms of knowledge (of our own ideas and of our own existence) conveyed with whatever is given in the perception of any idea.33\n",
            "\n",
            "As additional support, let me draw attention to Locke’s Book IV explanation of the different categories of agreements constituting knowledge. There, Locke seems to equate intuitively knowing our ideas with the mental operation of distinguishing ideas: the mind clearly and infallibly perceives each idea to agree with itself, and to be what it is; and all distinct ideas to disagree, i.e. the one not to be the other: and this it does without pains, labour, or deduction; but at first view by its natural power of Perception and Distinction. (IV.i.2) Here, Locke states that just in virtue of the mind’s natural power to perceive and distinguish ideas, we are able to know “clearly and infallibly,” their identity—that they are as we perceive them. Distinguishing ideas falls under the mental faculty of “discerning,” which Locke describes in Book II as the mind “distinguishing between the several Ideas it has” (II.xi.1).34 In these passages, then, Locke is saying that discerning an idea, or what is the same, perceiving a distinct idea (distinguishing it) entails also knowing it intuitively. The explanation, I suggest, is that when I perceive (distinguish) an idea, I know that it is the idea it is—I know that there is an idea in my mind, and I know what it is. The intuitive knowledge of an idea is conveyed as a part of the perceptual act of distinguishing it. But distinguishing an idea is no more than to perceive it, which results in knowing it.\n",

There he says, “For a Man cannot conceive himself capable of a greater Certainty, than to know that any Idea in his Mind is such, as he perceives it to be.” So, in four different chapters, two from Book II and two from Book IV, we find Locke equating perceiving an idea, perceiving it distinctly, and knowing its identity. This is strong textual evidence that whatever components constituting the agreement in knowing an idea are somehow present in the mind along with the idea, such that in perceiving it I also have knowledge.\n",

            "In fact, knowing my own ideas and my own existence is not the only kind of intuitive knowledge conveyed as a part of simply having the constituents of the agreement in the mind.

Thus the mind perceives that white is not black, that a circle is not a triangle, that three are more than two and equal to one and two. Such kinds of truths the mind perceives at the first sight of the ideas together, by bare intuition; without the intervention of any other idea: and this kind of knowledge is the clearest and most certain that human frailty is capable of.

Therefore, intuitively knowing agreements or disagreements (as described in the passage above) seems not to require a mental act in addition to perceiving the ideas together in the mind. Similarly, it seems reasonable to conclude that having intuitive knowledge of our own ideas requires nothing more than having whatever constitutes that agreement together in the mind.35 Owen (1999: 47) states\n",

It is but like a Monkey shifting his Oyster from one hand to the other; and had he had but Words, might, no doubt, have said, Oyster in right hand is Subject, and Oyster in left hand is Predicate: and so might have made a self-evident Proposition of Oyster, i.e. Oyster is Oyster; and yet, with all this, not have been one whit the wiser, or more knowing.

Every one that has any Knowledge at all, has, as the Foundation of it various and distinct Ideas: And it is the first Act of the Mind, (without which, it can never be capable of any Knowledge,) to know every one of its Ideas by itself, and distinguish it from others.

            "Third, we can look to Locke’s II.xxxii analysis of the truth and falsity of ideas for more help. There, Locke distinguishes two ways in which we can speak of ideas as true or false. On the one hand, ideas can be true or false in the “ordinary Acceptation,” which is when we refer an idea to something else such that we can affirm or deny conformity of the idea to that thing. The three most common cases are the reference of an idea in my mind to an idea in another person’s mind, the reference of an idea to some “real existence,” and the reference of an idea to a “real Constitution, and essence of any thing” (II.xxxii.5). On the other hand, and this is the one we are interested in, an idea can be true in what Locke calls the “metaphysical sense of the Word Truth”: as all other Things, that any way exist, are said to be true; i.e. really to be such as they exist.\n",
            "\n",
            "Though in Things called true even in that Sense, there is, perhaps a secret reference to our Ideas, look’d upon as the Standards of that Truth, which amounts to a mental Proposition, though it be usually not taken notice of. (II.xxxii.2)\n",

            "This locution, that an idea is “really to be such as it exists,” is remarkably similar to those propositions Locke uses (just mentioned above) to describe what we know when we have intuitive knowledge of the identity of an idea. Perhaps it is fair to say that when I perceive an idea, it is “metaphysically” true, and I know it intuitively.\n",
            "\n",
            "Moreover, Locke asserts that ideas in themselves, “being only so many . . . appearances there [in the mind],” cannot be false.41 So, there is a mental proposition that expresses the reason why ideas deserve to be affirmed as true—the reason why they cannot be misidentified. This reason is the agreement constitutive of the truth of an idea. This truth, expressed by the proposition “the idea is as it exists in my mind” or by the proposition “the idea is as I perceive it to be,” is known as the result of perceiving an idea.\n",
            "\n",
            "What, though, should we make of Locke’s claim that “perhaps there is a secret reference . . . to our Ideas . . . as the Standards of that Truth” and that the mental proposition is “usually not taken notice of ”? I suggest that because the perception of an idea is a complex propositional state, we can know that proposition insofar as we perceive the idea. The agreeing elements as found together in the complex propositional state constitute the “secret reference” of the idea to itself: Insofar as the elements internal to the propositional state stand to each other, the idea can be\n",

When Locke says that the proposition “is not usually tak[en] notice of ” we can see him as distinguishing what constitutes the truth of the idea from what constitutes our knowledge of that truth.

            "Locke does not say specifically that having knowledge requires that we attend to our mental states, but he does say that “taking notice” of our mental states is required for the production of ideas of sensation (II.ix.4) and of ideas of reflection (II.i.4, II.i.7). If some degree of attention is required for passively receiving ideas of sensation, then it is reasonable to think that having knowledge of our own ideas (or having knowledge of any other agreement) requires it too. In all three cases, though, Locke seems to see attention as a way of engaging in an act of perception rather than constituting an additional perception. This seems to be confirmed in II.xix.3 when Locke “digresses” from his explication of the modes of thinking to mention “Attention, Revery, and Dreaming,” which are described as “different state[s] of the Mind in thinking.” For example, “the mind employs it self about them [its perceptions of ideas] with several different degrees of Attention. Sometimes the mind fixes it self with so much earnestness on the Contemplation of some Objects. . . . At other times, it barely observes the train of Ideas.” Presumably, perceiving an agreement can fall anywhere on this scale. Insofar as I take notice of the idea of the black of the typed words and the idea of the white of the paper in front of me, I know that “the black of the type is not the white of the paper.” Such is the nature of intuitive knowledge; I just have it “as soon as ever the Mind turns its view” (IV.ii.1) to those ideas. Similarly, because perceptions of ideas are propositional states, insofar as I take notice of the idea I am perceiving, I will know that proposition. It is time now to turn to the agreeing elements constituting the truth of the proposition known.\n",

That is, what is the nature of the agreement the perception of which constitutes our knowledge of an idea? Important to keep in mind, as we move through these arguments, is that perceptions of ideas are complex mental states with distinct constituent elements.\n",

            "every perception of an idea.42 But Locke also states clearly that every idea is accompanied by an idea of existence: Existence and Unity, are two other Ideas, that are suggested to the Understanding, by every Object without, and every Idea within.

But also constituent in the complex mental state, and so simultaneous with the idea perceived and the idea of existence, is consciousness, which is an awareness of an I perceiving.

In one case, it is an agreement between qualitative patterns or features making up the idea and the first-personal way (due to consciousness) in which it is presented to me (the way in which I perceive it to be). In the other case, it is an agreement between the qualitative patterns or features of the idea and the existential way (due to the idea of existence) in which it is presented to me.45 In both cases, there is agreement between various elements of my mental content resulting in the knowledge of what the idea is and that it is there.\n",

            "To bolster my interpretation that we can have one true proposition expressing agreements among three different constituents of the perception of an idea, it is helpful to borrow from a well-known interpretation of Locke’s understanding of the agreement in a different case—a case of sensitive knowledge. Ruth Mattern (1978: 682) cites passages from the Essay (those we have already seen) to show that, for Locke, all knowledge is propositional. Mattern (1978: 682) then argues that Locke sees the definition of knowledge (the perception of an agreement or disagreement of ideas) “as equivalent to the statement in the Elements of Natural Philosophy that knowledge ‘consists in the perception of the truth of affirmative or negative propositions’” (W III: 329). Mattern applies this conclusion to resolve the apparent conflict between the general definition of knowledge and Locke’s description of sensitive knowledge as “an actual real Existence agreeing to an Idea” (IV.i.7). The upshot is that Locke failed to separate sharply two different senses of “agreement and disagreement of ideas.” There is the “agreement and disagreement within propositions,” and there is the “agreement and\n",

            "In Locke’s words, I am considering only their “metaphysical truth” or as they “really [are] such as [they] exist.” So my argument should not be confused with relations (especially simple) ideas bear to external things as found in the chapters on “Real” and “Adequate” ideas.\n",
            "\n",
            "disagreement that render propositions true” (1978: 693, my emphasis). In the latter case, as we have, she argues, in sensitive knowledge, what grounds the knowledge is not the relation between the ideas themselves as found in the proposition. Rather, what grounds the knowledge is what guarantees the truth of the proposition. As Mattern explains, these are cases in which there are “states of affairs that render propositions true and false. . . . It is . . . what Locke . . . terms the ‘grounds of Affirmation and Negation’” (E IV.i.7: 527). But in the former case, which Mattern (1978: 693) calls “idea-theoretic” truths, “the two sorts of agreement coincide; the relation between ideas is both the state rendering the proposition true and the state of the proposition expressing this truth.” Applying this argument to a case of knowing an idea, namely an “idea-theoretic truth,” we can see our knowledge of an idea as grounded in the state of affairs that renders the idea (“metaphysically”) true, but at the same time it is also the agreement expressed in the structure or composition of the proposition itself.48\n",
            "\n",
            "Perhaps now is the time to consider a few possible objections. First, one might wonder whether I have actually succeeded in showing that intuitive knowledge of our own ideas is consistent with Locke’s definition of knowledge. For example, Newman (2004, 2007) argues that knowledge, for Locke, consists only in a perception of an agreement between two ideas. Rickless (2008: 86) cites the following passage from IV.i.5 as the most persuasive of the same claim, since it seems to say that there is “no room” for any kind of agreement that is not between two ideas: “There could be no room for any positive Knowledge at all, if we could not perceive any Relation between our Ideas, and find out the Agreement or Disagreement, they have one with another, in several ways the Mind takes of comparing them.” I do not think we have to see the interpretation I have offered as conflicting with these passages. One reason is that the latter is found in the section in which Locke is describing only our knowledge of general truths as covered in the specific category of “Relation in general.” When describing these relations Locke usually refers to mathematical or moral relations, which are primarily known through demonstrations. But as already noted, knowing the identity of an idea (and of our own existence and even of the existence of an external object) is an instance of having knowledge of a particular thing, which perhaps calls for a different, yet by and large consistent, explanation. And as Locke has warned us in IV.i.7, these are “peculiar ways of agreements.” But more to the point, I do not think my interpretation disagrees with Locke’s definition of knowledge, since there is the perception of an agreement of ideas, even if there is more to the agreement that just what we get from those two ideas.49\n",
            "\n",
            "Second, there might be a different, yet related objection: my account of the proposition in knowing an idea conflicts with Locke’s IV.5 account of truth. Locke says that truth is “the joining or separating of Signs, as the Things signified by them, do agree or disagree one with another” (IV.5.2) and that “Truth properly belongs only to Propositions” (IV.5.2). Thus, the objection would be that a true proposition must be the joining of signs, either ideas or words. It cannot be, as I have argued, the joining of constituents of the complex mental state of perceiving an idea, since one of those three constituents is consciousness. I suggest, however, that Locke leaves room for just such an interpretation. At the end of his discussion of true and false ideas in II.xxxii.19, Locke has this to say: Though in compliance with the ordinary way of Speaking, I have shewed in what sense, and upon what ground our Ideas may be sometimes called true, or false; yet if we look a little nearer into the matter in all cases, where any Idea is call’d true, or false, it is from some Judgment that the Mind makes, or is supposed to make, that is true, or false. For Truth, or Falshood, being never without some Affirmation, or Negation, Express, or Tacit, it is not to be found, but where signs are joined or separated, according to the agreement, or disagreement, of the Things they stand for. The signs we chiefly use, are either Ideas, or Words, wherewith we make either mental, or verbal Propositions. (II.xxxii.19)\n",
            "\n",
            "Notice that when we look very closely into the grounds of truth or falsity (whether it is the “ordinary way of Speaking” or the metaphysical sense) what constitutes the truth of an idea is due to “some [true] judgment the mind makes.” Moreover, the signs we use to compose those propositions, Locke says, are “chiefly” ideas and words. Therefore, there can be cases in which a sign used to form the proposition is not an idea or a word. Therefore, it can be consciousness, an awareness of an I perceiving.\n",
            "\n",
            "Third, one might want to accept the spirit of my interpretation but at the same time press the foregoing objection by arguing that there are other ways to interpret knowing an idea, ways perhaps that are more in keeping with the assumption that the proposition known is a common identity statement.50 For example, we might see Locke as saying that when there is an idea in the mind I know its truth by comparing that idea with another idea. For example, the comparison would be of the original idea white with another idea white, say from memory. But if this is Locke’s view, then his account of the intuitive knowledge of our own ideas as “foundational” cannot get off the ground, for we would need already a standard in the mind by which to make the comparison and perceive the identity (agreement). This would also threaten Locke’s empiricism.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another possible explanation (in the form of an objection) is that when we perceive and distinguish an idea, the mind duplicates or re-presents the idea so that there can\n",
            "\n",
            "be a comparison between them. But this seems an unlikely scenario considering Locke’s derogatory view of “identity propositions” (IV.viii.2). Thus, we can see this disparaging attitude extending to mental propositions formed and agreements perceived as the result of a re-presentation of an idea. In addition, in the IV.i.4 explanation of our knowledge of the agreement of identity, just after he says that we know ideas individually, Locke denies that “any maxim or Proposition in the World [would] make him know it clearer or surer than he did before.” If it is Locke’s view that knowing the identity of an idea consists in re-presenting the idea and then perceiving an agreement between the original and the re-presentation, then surely this would be a case in which a proposition is generated to affirm what we already seem to know about the original idea. Furthermore, to assign to Locke a re-presentation interpretation would saddle him with the psychologically implausible view that the mind engages in the task of double-checking its ideas in order to know that they really are as we perceive them. Charity would frown on such a move.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, if the identity perceived in the re-presentation view is interpreted as the perception of resemblance between a particular idea and a re-presentation of itself, then knowing the identity of an idea is no different from knowing any other relation.\n",
            "\n",
            "But Locke himself, already cited from IV.i.7 in the introduction to this chapter, makes a point of distinguishing the agreement of identity from agreements, like resemblance, that fall into the category of relation in general. Owen (1999: 41) analyzes the peculiarity this way: “Identity is distinct because it is primordial and fundamental to our awareness of ideas.” Given everything said, I suggest that there are sufficient reasons to accept the interpretation I have put forward.\n",

            "### 3.I.5. An Analogous Case: Knowing I Exist As mentioned earlier, Locke’s version of the cogito argument includes the claim that we have intuitive knowledge of our own existence conveyed in the act of perceiving any idea: As for our own Existence, we perceive it so plainly, and so certainly, that it neither needs, nor is capable of any proof. For nothing can be more evident to us, than our own Existence. I think, I reason, I feel Pleasure and Pain; Can any of these be more evident to me, than my own Existence? . . . Experience then convinces us, that we have an intuitive Knowledge of our own Existence, and an internal infallible Perception that we are. In every Act of Sensation, Reasoning, or Thinking, we are conscious to our selves of our own Being; and, in this Matter, come not short of the highest degree of Certainty. (IV.ix.3)\n",

Third, it is important that he does not say that knowing my own existence requires anything in addition to what is presently in my mind. Neither does he say that the knowledge is inferred in a separate act of the mind. Thus, there are very good reasons to conclude that we have certain non-inferential knowledge of our own existence as a part of perceiving an idea.\n",

            "If we try to provide the same sort of analysis here as we did in knowing our own ideas, then there must be a proposition whose stated agreement expresses what makes the proposition true. And in perceiving any idea we know that truth. In a way that is a analogous, then, to how in perceiving an idea, I know the truth of the idea—that “it is as I am perceiving it to be,” in perceiving an idea I know the truth of my existence— that the “I perceiving exists.” To see this, consider again Locke’s analysis of knowing an idea: we know that an idea exists in the mind and we know that what is presented in the mind is as we perceive it. Explaining these aspects of knowing an idea required that we isolate the three (simultaneous) constituents of any perception of an idea: an idea perceived, an idea of existence, and consciousness (an I perceiving). As the result of all three constituents in the mind simultaneously, there is an agreement of mental content—a state of affairs—expressed in any of a family of propositions Locke uses when he speaks of knowing an idea. Similarly, knowing that “I exist” is the result of perceiving any idea, because of the simultaneity of the same trio of constituents—the same mental content, most specifically the idea of existence and consciousness. So, when I perceive an idea, just as I have the intuitive knowledge that “the idea is as I am perceiving it to be,” I also have the intuitive knowledge that “I exist as perceiving an idea”—or more simply, that I exist. Again, as the result of the complexity of a perception of an idea, there is a proposition whose stated agreement is what makes the proposition true. And in perceiving the idea, I know that proposition. The compresence of all three constituents of any perception of an idea is the state rendering true and at the same time the state of those true propositions expressing what we know when we know our ideas and our own existence.\n",

Wynne takes Locke to “comprehend under the general Name of Intuition, the Knowledge we have of our own existence and Thoughts as well as of self-evident truths,” but “at the same time to allow, what my friend contends for, that If we come to distinguish nicely, we may conceive A difference between the Internal perception or Sensation of our own Existence, the Consciousness of our Thoughts, and the perception of Self-evident Truths, All which seem to have an equal degree of certainty and evidence.” This is consistent with the interpretation offered in that we can see Locke as not wanting to limit consciousness to the intuitive knowledge of ourselves or of our ideas, but at the same time wanting consciousness to play a role in the immediacy of the knowledge we have in virtue of the perceptions of ideas themselves.\n",

Both Martha Brandt Bolton (2004a, 2004b) and Antonia LoLordo (2008) have argued persuasively that Locke seems unable adequately to account for perceptual error when it comes to sensory ideas. But if there is no immunity to error when it comes to these, then certainly Locke’s claim that my knowledge of my own ideas can serve as the foundation for knowledge cannot be right. Why should we think it is?\n",

For example, I can misidentify the round tower I now see as square, and I can in general identify honey as always bitter instead of sweet. Problematically, our sensory ideas are not immune to error.\n",

Still I experienced the idea pain in my incisor. Then in the course of a regular check-up, the dentist discovered a crack in my left front molar, just two teeth down from the painful incisor. After this tooth was crowned, I no longer experienced pain in my incisor. So all along I had been misidentifying the idea pain in my incisor. That is, the representational content of the idea was actually pain in my molar, since the idea was in a relation of regular correspondence with my molar and “marking” or distinguishing the impinging of the nerve in my molar.54 So Locke’s commitments with respect to the representational role of sensory ideas—that they correctly identify their causes—cannot accommodate what I take to be a somewhat common experience of misidentifying our own ideas.55\n",

That is, a “content theory” of ideas allows us to distinguish what we are thinking about (the object of thinking) from the content of thinking (the way of experiencing the object of thinking): The object thought about (the external cause) is not the same as the subjective experience we have in thinking about it.

Therefore, that Locke has difficulty accommodating perceptual error is not evidence that we do not always know our own ideas.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3.I.7 A Textual Objection and Reply In spite of the fact that my interpretation includes that there are always two ideas in the mind as the result of perceiving any idea, one might still think that two passages in the Correspondence with Stillingfleet give cause for worry. For Locke seems to say that we cannot have knowledge as the result of perceiving an idea: For I place certainty where I think everybody will find it, and nowhere else, viz. in the perception of the agreement or disagreement of ideas; so that, in my opinion, it is impossible to be placed in any one single idea, simple or complex. (Locke 1823, iv: 57)\n",
            "\n",
            "Nor is it one idea by itself that in any case makes us certain; but certainty consists in the perceived agreement or disagreement of all the ideas that serve to show the agreement or disagreement of distinct ideas, as they stand in a proposition, whose truth or falsehood we would be certain of. (Locke 1823, iv: 60)\n",
            "\n",
            "Given my interpretation I find this objection a little far-fetched, but let me still try to alleviate any possible concern. It might be helpful, first, to look at the context in which Locke makes the above statements to Stillingfleet. These statements are in response to Stillingfleet’s insistence that Locke has not proved the existence of God by the use of ideas, but by the use of reason, namely by employing innately known “principles of reason” (Locke 1823, iv: 56). Just following the first passage in question, Locke (1823, iv: 57) rephrases Stillingfleet’s objection as follows: “What! Can the grounds of our certainty arise from the idea of ourselves? No, certainly.” To which Locke “with due respect” replies, “Yes, certainly. The certainty of the being of a God is grounded on the idea of ourselves as we are thinking beings.” Locke (1823, iv: 58)\n",
            "\n",
            "continues, “My lord, I must confess I never thought, that the consideration of ourselves, and what we find in our own constitutions, excluded the consideration of the idea either of being or of thinking, two of the ideas that make a part of the complex idea a man has of him self.”57 Thus, the context of the passage, namely that the argument for the existence of God can begin with the complex idea of a human being as a thinking being, tells against the objection. For, first, Locke does allow that the perception of an idea leads to a proposition constituting knowledge: The consideration of a complex idea of ourselves can lead to a proposition containing ideas of thinking and being, ideas internal to the complex idea.\n",
            "\n",
            "Second, when Locke says that knowledge “cannot be placed in any one single idea,” he means that knowledge is propositional. But that all knowledge is propositional is fully consistent with the interpretation I have given in which we perceive the truth of a proposition as the result of perceiving an idea—or, really, as the result of perceiving a constellation of mental content that includes two ideas. Indeed, it is somewhat analogous to Locke’s own example in which the truth of a proposition is perceived on the basis of perceiving all of the component elements contributing to the complexity of an idea.\n",
            "\n",
            "Third, the context of the passage tells against the objection in another way. Locke’s statement that we cannot have knowledge with only one idea is in defense of his view that reason is a capacity of the mind employed about the ideas gained from sensation and reflection. Reason, for Locke, “perceives the necessary, and indubitable connexion of all the Ideas or Proofs one to another” (IV.xvii.2). Reason, therefore, is an ability of the mind to “cast about” for intermediate premises to help construct a demonstrative proof. It is not to be thought of as a stock of already known rational principles (or ideas) waiting in the mind to be discovered. This is suggested by Locke’s reply that he does not understand what Stillingfleet could mean when he puts forward the view that “from the consideration of ourselves, and what we find in our own constitutions, the certainty is placed in good and sound reason. . . . But not in the idea” (iv: 58). I suggest that Locke’s response here has to do with how we are able to come to knowledge of the existence of God, not just by the consideration of an idea, but also by the mind’s ability to use the faculty of reason to construct a demonstrative proof. So, Locke is not necessarily denying that we can have propositional knowledge on the basis of perceiving individual ideas. He is only denying that an individual idea (without either propositions or the use of reason) can result in a successful demonstration. Therefore, we need not read the foregoing statements to Stillingfleet as precluding the interpretation of the intuitive knowledge of an idea (or of ourselves) that I have put forward.\n",
            "\n",
            "Considering what we find in the Essay, that is, owing to (1) the claim that we know the identity of individual ideas; (2) the claim that general identity statements\n",
            "\n",
            "are trivial while knowledge of the identity of an idea is foundational; (3) the evidence that consciousness is self-consciousness and of the particular relation between consciousness and perception that allows textual and philosophical consistency to Locke’s model of the mind; (4) the claim that we have an idea of existence “joined” or “annexed” to every other idea; (5) the evidence that there need not be an additional mental act to know an agreement intuitively; and (6) the claim that ideas are “metaphysically true,” namely “really to be such as they exist” in the mind, something along the lines of what I have argued might be the best we can do for Locke. The sheer number of passages affirming something like the interpretation I have put forward should, at the very least, tip the balance in its favor. Therefore, we should see the intuitive knowledge of our own ideas, which grounds the possibility of attaining any knowledge at all, as well as the knowledge of our own existence, as forms of propositional knowledge conveyed in the perception of an individual idea. That is, perceptions of ideas are complex propositional states conveying knowledge.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3.I.8 Conclusion So far in this chapter, I have worked to fill in Locke scholarship by providing an interpretation of the intuitive knowledge of an individual idea that is consistent with Locke’s understanding of knowledge as the perception of a true proposition (an agreement of ideas) and that can serve as a suitable foundation for knowledge given what we find in the Essay and elsewhere. I argued that perceptions of ideas are complex propositional states that convey knowledge. In perceiving any idea, I know two propositions resulting from agreeing elements therein. Because in the perception of any idea there is included an idea of existence and my consciousness of myself as perceiving both ideas, I know tacitly or implicitly that the idea is as I am perceiving it to be and that I exist. Now that I have explained the complexity of our mental states and how as the result of that complexity we have knowledge of our own ideas and our own existence, in parts II and III I will extend that analysis to an explanation of how (in part II), and the extent to which (in part III), for Locke, we can claim to have knowledge of particular things existing external to us. As will be shown, the same trio of elements constituent in any perception of an idea have a role to play in constituting the agreement perceived in what Locke calls “sensitive” knowledge.\n",
            "\n",
            "## PART II Knowing the Existence of Particular External Objects In part I of this chapter, I argued that knowing the agreements in the intuitive knowledge of our own ideas and of our own existence is the result of the complexity inherent in the perception of any idea. As the result of the trio of constituents in the complex mental state of perceiving an idea, we have two different forms of propositional knowledge. Here in part II, I will extend that analysis to an explanation of the agreement perceived in knowing the existence of particular external objects. Just as we saw in the previous cases, the agreement perceived in having knowledge of something external to me will also make sense of the proposition Locke uses to express it. Moreover, consciousness will have a specific role to play, one a little different from, but consistent with, what we saw in the other two cases of knowing truths about particular things.\n",
            "\n",
            "As we know, knowledge in general, for Locke, consists in the perception of an agreement of ideas expressed in a true proposition. But, also, knowledge comes in three “degrees” of evidence, or certainty: intuitive knowledge, demonstrative knowledge, and sensitive knowledge. As far as intuitive and demonstrative knowledge go, Locke is right in line with other seventeenth-century figures, most notably Descartes.\n",
            "\n",
            "But when it comes to sensitive knowledge—our knowledge of particular external world objects—he holds a very peculiar view. He insists that we have knowledge of the external world even though he also thinks that all we perceive directly are our own ideas, mental objects that act as intermediaries between us and the world. To see how Locke can hold such a view, let us start with a brief description of what Locke calls “sensitive” knowledge of “the existence of particular finite beings without us” (IV.ii.14) and then consider some of the well-known questions arising from his account. What follows here and in part III will provide answers to these questions, as well as explain the role of consciousness and the complexity of our mental states in answering them.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the following passages, we find Locke’s distinctions between the three degrees of certainty of knowledge.58 First, Locke provides a general statement of the kind of difference we see in the three degrees of knowledge: All our Knowledge consisting, as I have said in the view the Mind has of its own Ideas, which is the utmost Light and greatest Certainty, we with our Faculties, and in our way of Knowledge are capable of, it may not be amiss, to consider a little the degrees of its Evidence. The different clearness of our Knowledge seems to me to lie in the different way of Perception, the Mind has of the Agreement, or Disagreement of any of its Ideas. (IV.ii.1)\n",
            "\n",
            "Then he tells us that the way of perceiving in intuitive knowledge provides the highest degree of certainty: For if we reflect on our own ways of Thinking, we shall find, that sometimes the Mind perceives the Agreement or Disagreement of two Ideas immediately by themselves, without the intervention of any other: And this, I think, we may call intuitive Knowledge. (IV.ii.1)\n",
            "\n",
            "Next, the way of perceiving in demonstrative knowledge has less certainty: The next degree of Knowledge is, where the Mind perceives the Agreement or Disagreement of any of its Ideas, but not immediately. . . . In this Case, then, when the Mind cannot so bring its Ideas together, as by their immediate Comparison, and as it were Juxta-position, or application to one another, to perceive their Agreement or Disagreement, it is fain, by the Intervention of other Ideas (one or more, as it happens) to discover the Agreement or Disagreement, which it searches; and this is that which we call Reasoning. (IV.ii.2)\n",
            "\n",
            "This Knowledge by intervening Proofs, though it be certain, yet the evidence of it is not altogether so clear and bright, nor the assent so ready, as in intuitive Knowledge. (IV.ii.4)\n",
            "\n",
            "And finally, sensitive knowledge has the lowest degree of certainty: These two, (viz.) Intuition and Demonstration, are the degrees of our Knowledge; whatever comes short of one of these, with what assurance soever embraced, is by Faith, or Opinion, but not Knowledge, at least in all general Truths. There is, indeed, another Perception of the Mind, employ’d about the particular existence of finite Beings without us; which going beyond bare probability, and yet not reaching perfectly to either of the foregoing degrees of certainty, passes under the name of Knowledge. (IV.ii.14)\n",
            "\n",
            "Intuitive knowledge is most certain, demonstrative knowledge is a little less certain, and sensitive knowledge (of the truth of the existence of particular things external to\n",
            "\n",
            "Locke, however, does seem to say fairly explicitly that demonstrative knowledge is a different degree of certainty when he “allow[s] these three degrees of Knowledge, viz. Intuitive, Demonstrative, and Sensitive: In each of which, there are different degrees and ways of Evidence and Certainty” (IV.ii.14). Also, I will address the consistency of both holding that demonstrative knowledge is less certain than intuitive knowledge and Locke’s claims about the difference between them in lustre, clearness, and distinctness in part III.\n",
            "\n",
            "us) is even less certain than that. Which degree of certainty is reached seems to depend on the way the agreement is perceived. Immediately known agreements, noninferential knowledge, have the highest degree of certainty, while the need for intervening ideas, resulting in inferential knowledge, lessens the certainty.\n",
            "\n",
            "What about sensitive knowledge? Is it inferential, or is it non-inferential? Answering this question merely leads to a host of others. On the one hand, if it is inferential, then how is it any different from demonstrative knowledge? Perhaps the reason is that it has to do with particular existences as opposed to general truths. Quite naturally, we would think there to be an inference from an idea to the existence of an external object. But then, also quite naturally, we might ask why it qualifies as anything more than probable judgment. Support for this line of reasoning, one might continue, is found in IV.xi.4–7, where Locke provides a series of probabilistic arguments in defense of sensitive knowledge. Thinking these arguments are meant as sole justification for sensitive knowledge, however, leaves us again wondering why Locke calls it knowledge. Why would he open the door to a third degree of knowledge by distinguishing it from demonstrative knowledge of general truths? On the other hand, if sensitive knowledge is non-inferential, then how is it different from intuitive knowledge, and how can it be less certain than demonstrative knowledge?\n",
            "\n",
            "I suggest that these questions, roughly, boil down to the following three: First, how can Locke think that we have knowledge of things external to the mind when ideas serve as the immediate objects of perception? Second, given that Locke thinks sensitive knowledge counts as a (less certain) form of knowledge, why would he offer a series of probabilistic arguments in defense of it? Third, how should we see sensitive knowledge as something different from intuitive and demonstrative knowledge given that we are limited to just two ways of perceiving agreements: either noninferentially or inferentially? I see the first two questions, and relatedly the third, as motivated primarily by skeptical concerns. Given that ideas are the objects of perception, how can Locke think we have knowledge of things external to us? Another way to pose this question is to ask, what does Locke think we actually know in an instance of sensitive knowledge, and how do we know it? Later in part III of this chapter, I will offer an interpretation of sensitive knowledge that answers these skeptical concerns.\n",
            "\n",
            "Before we move on to Locke’s treatment of the skeptical challenge, though, it is important, first, to address a different puzzle. For seeing how sensitive knowledge can fall under the category of knowledge at all requires an understanding of how it satisfies the general definition of knowledge. What is the agreement perceived in an instance of sensitive knowledge such that, given Locke’s representationalism, it makes sense to say we have sufficient contact with things outside us to make any claims about their actual existence? Here in part II, I provide an answer to this question.\n",
            "\n",
            "Locke understands knowledge as consisting in the perception of an agreement or disagreement of ideas (IV.i.2). From this, he says, “it follows . . . That [w]e can have Knowledge no farther than we have Ideas” (IV.iii.1). But then he describes the agreement in sensitive knowledge, a species of the knowledge of real existence, as\n",
            "\n",
            "“that of actual real Existence agreeing to any Idea” (IV.i.7).59 These two descriptions seem to conflict, and no interpretive suggestion for how to resolve the tension has carried the day. How can knowledge extend no farther than our ideas (be the perception of an agreement of ideas) and yet what we know is expressed by the proposition: “actual real Existence agreeing to any Idea”?\n",
            "\n",
            "A spate of interpretations has come forward in recent years, each emphasizing various aspects of Locke’s account. My interpretation is in agreement with many of these aspects. For example, like Mattern (1978) and Soles (1985), I emphasize the propositional nature of knowledge. But unlike them, I do not argue that the true proposition known corresponds to an external existent. Rather my interpretation is fully consistent with Locke’s general (fully ideational) definition of knowledge.60 Like Ayers (1991) and Bolton (2004a), I give due weight to the contribution of Locke’s semantic externalism. Unlike them, I argue that the proposition known in an instance of sensitive knowledge includes also internalist epistemic justification. Like Allen (2013) and Nagel (forthcoming), I argue for the importance of the subjective experience of sensing in an instance of sensitive knowledge. Unlike both, I argue that the proposition known does not include a reflective idea of sensation. And like Owen (2008), Allen (2013), and Weinberg (2013), I argue that sensitive knowledge is noninferential.61 But my account, unlike all these others (and some I have not mentioned),62 fully explains the contribution of both the internalist and externalist aspects, and it does so without textual conflict and without tempting incoherence with other of Locke’s views. Because these other interpretations and objections to them are readily available and it would take up far too much space to rehearse them all, I will not reiterate them here.63 Rather, when appropriate, I will simply note reasons for\n",

Because my account of the internalist condition and so my reconciliation of the apparent tension in Locke’s account of sensitive knowledge might seem much like Allen’s and Nagel’s, I will spend ample time at the end explaining the difference and why mine succeeds in avoiding a particularly sticky problem, while theirs do not.\n",

            "To elicit the nature of the elements of the agreement perceived in sensitive knowledge, it will be helpful first to look at that to which Locke’s account of sensitive knowledge seems to be committed. In sections 3.II.2–4, I will show how each commitment contributes an element to the mental state of affairs expressed in the proposition Locke uses in IV.1.7 to describe an instance of our knowledge of the real existence of an external object. Consistent with the previous analysis in part I of how we know other particular things (individual ideas and our own existence), the same trio of constituents comprising the complexity of the perception of an idea forms the agreement perceived in an instance of sensitive knowledge. Therefore, as in those other two cases, there is no conflict with Locke’s general definition of knowledge.\n",

            "### 3.II.1 Locke’s Commitments—The Elements of Sensitive Knowledge A survey of the Essay reveals that Locke’s account of perceiving the agreement in sensitive knowledge includes five fundamental elements: 1. Knowledge in general is defined as “the perception of the connexion and agreement, or disagreement and repugnancy of any of our Ideas” (IV.i.2).\n",
            "\n",

            "strictly speaking, there is no perception of an agreement of ideas. Soles (1985) also finds a solution in Locke’s propositional account of knowledge by arguing that inferences to unobservable entities are not precluded by Locke’s empiricist principle that all knowledge originates in ideas of sensation and reflection.\n",
            "\n",
            "But, arguably, both of these views stray from Locke’s definition of knowledge as the perception of an agreement or disagreement of ideas. Newman (2004, 2007) tries to reconcile the tension by having sensitive knowledge include both the perception of an agreement of ideas and a probable judgment between an idea and something external to us. Rickless (2008) and Allen (2013) lodge well-reasoned objections to Newman’s view. Rickless (2008) attempts reconciliation by arguing that the perception of some true propositions really only achieves the highest degree of probability, or what he calls “assurance.” Owen (1999), Allen (2013), Weinberg (2013), and Nagel (forthcoming) offer objections to Rickless (2008), and all but Weinberg offer their own interpretations of the agreement perceived constituting knowledge consistent with the definition of knowledge. (I am providing my interpretation in this part of chapter three.) Rickless (forthcoming) tries to defend his view against objections by Allen, Nagel, and Owen, (and Weinberg indirectly). Reiterating arguments by Owen, Allen, Weinberg, and Nagel, most recently Wilson (2014: 10) sums it up by saying “there are simply too many passages in which Locke refers to sensitive knowledge as knowledge while not giving any indication that he is only honorifically referring to it as such.”\n",

I think it is fair to say that Locke thinks each of these five elements has some sort of role to play in an instance of sensitive knowledge.64 Each is mentioned and seemingly relied on in the various places where Locke discusses how we might have sufficient contact with an external world to claim some sort of knowledge of it. And even if some interpretations admit all five elements, significant disagreement exists over what role each part actually plays.\n",

I argue that all five elements can be brought together into a reasonable and coherent picture of the agreement perceived in an instance of sensitive knowledge as Locke sees it—not probable judgment. One reason is that Locke, not unsurprisingly, focuses on the relation sensory ideas in fact have not only to external causes, but also, and perhaps equally importantly, to our subjective internal experience in having ideas of external objects. I will argue that elements (1)–(5) above can be accounted for by looking to what is presented to us in consciousness and what is implied by what is presented to us as the result of perceiving an occurrent idea of an external object. Consistent with how we know our own ideas and our own existence, I argue that this other form of knowledge—what Locke calls our knowledge of the existence of “particular finite beings”—is due to the complex nature of our perceptual states. Because of the complexity of perceptions of ideas and because of Locke’s one-act view of knowledge, we can know an agreement expressed by the proposition “actual real Existence agreeing to an Idea” just in virtue of having that complex mental state.

When I say that I am providing only the skeleton of the agreement, what I mean is that I am providing only some of the elements (parts of the state of affairs) that go into making up the full agreement. In each subsequent section, I will fill out the agreement by arguing for the inclusion of more elements, until we arrive at the full state of affairs expressed by the proposition Locke uses in IV.i.7 to describe an instance of sensitive knowledge. By the end of section II.4, all of Locke’s commitments will be accounted for, the proposition known in an instance of sensitive knowledge will be fully constructed, and the tension between sensitive knowledge and the general definition of knowledge will be resolved.\n",

            "Let us begin with the definition of knowledge as the perception of an agreement of ideas. What we are looking for is the ideas that form the basis of the agreement in an instance of sensitive knowledge. Locke’s IV.ii.14 account of what happens in an instance of sensitive knowledge is a natural place to start. He begins with the statement that along with intuitive and demonstrative knowledge “There is, indeed, another Perception of the Mind, employ’d about the particular existence of finite beings without us.” Immediately thereafter, he says, “There can be nothing more certain than, that the Idea we receive from an external Object is in our Minds.” I take this to be a clear statement when we have an idea of an object we know that we do: We have intuitive knowledge of the idea.\n",
            "\n",

            "But remember that Locke also thinks that all ideas are accompanied by a simple idea of existence (II.vii.7). Every perception of an idea is a complex mental state that includes, at the very least, the idea perceived, an idea of existence, and consciousness.\n",

            "constituents. As Locke says about the accompanying simple idea of existence, “Existence and Unity, are two other Ideas, that are suggested to the Understanding, by every Object without and every Idea within. When Ideas are in our Minds, we consider them as being actually there, as well as we consider things to be actually without us; which is that they exist, or have Existence” (II.vii.7). As I have already argued, having any idea together with an idea of existence is the state of affairs expressed in the proposition that the idea is there—that it exists in my mind.\n",
            "\n",
            "Whenever I have an idea in my mind, the accompanying idea of existence contributes to my knowing that there exists something in my mind. But, as is clear from the preceding passage, Locke seems to think that, at least in some cases, I also take my idea to be as of something existing outside my mind. We see Locke say the same sort of thing when talking about the signification of names in III.iv.2: “The Names of simple Ideas and Substances, with the abstract Ideas in the Mind, which they immediately signify, intimate also some real Existence, from which was derived their original pattern.” For example, when I am thinking about a cat, I consider myself as having an idea of cat. Locke, though, seems to think that at the same time I take my idea to be as of a cat existing outside or independently of my mind. Donald Ainslie (2013: 99) puts it nicely here: “We are aware of objects by means of ideas that present them to us from our particular perspective, in the same way we are aware of things outside our visual field when we look at images of them in a mirror.” I take the idea of the cat in my mind to be an idea as of a cat existing outside my mind.

            "\n",
            "We see the same sort of language describing how we experience our ideas in other places in the Essay. In talking about ideas of substances in III.v.3, Locke says those ideas “carry with them the Supposition of some real Being, from which they are taken, and to which they are conformable” (my emphasis in bold). Locke’s chapters on “real” and “adequate” ideas (II.xxx–xxxii), which are an account of how ideas succeed in representing things to us, have similar language. In II.xxxi.1, Locke states that whenever we have ideas, we also suppose those ideas to be “taken from” their “archetypes” or causes: “Of our real Ideas some are Adequate, and some are Inadequate. Those I call Adequate, which perfectly represent those Archetypes, which the Mind supposes them taken from; which it intends them to stand for, and to which it refers them” (II.xxxi.1, my emphasis in bold). Perceiving an idea as of something external to me includes supposing the existence of whatever the idea “stands for” or is “referred to”—its archetype or cause.66 And it is not only “real” ideas that come with this suggestion that they are ideas of external things. In distinguishing “real” from\n",
            "\n",
            "“fantastical” ideas, Locke says of the latter that they “have no Foundation in Nature, nor have any Conformity with that reality of Being, to which they are tacitly referr’d, as to their Archetypes” (II.xxx.1, my emphasis in bold). So, also, we “tacitly refer” or “suppose” our fictional ideas to represent real things in Nature, even though we may come to find out that they really do not. It seems to be the case, for Locke, that whenever I have an idea, say of a particular object, I consider, or suppose, it to be of something external to me. I experience it as of something external to me, as of something outside my mind. Consistent with how Locke describes it in II.vii.7, I suggest that having an idea of existence “suggested to the Understanding” with an idea of an object is what this “taking,” “considering,” “supposing,” or as I have called it, “experiencing,” consists in. Thus, ideas of objects (say, of particular finite beings) just are experienced as ideas of real things—as of things having a real existence outside of me.\n",
            "\n",
            "Having these two ideas together in my mind (an idea of an object and an idea of existence) as a part of a more complex mental state gives me the experience or, as Locke says in II.vii.7, the suggestion, that what I am perceiving exists; I experience the idea as of an external object—as of something existing outside of my mind. That these two ideas and the experience of them together in the mind form the foundation of the agreement perceived in an instance of sensitive knowledge is confirmed by Locke in his defense of it to Stillingfleet: “[E]xistence is affirmed of something, some being: and I have as clear an idea of existence and something, the two things joined in that proposition, as I have of them in this proposition, ‘something exists in the world, whereof I have an idea’” (Works IV: 357–8). As we will see, more needs to be added to the explanation before we can claim to have sensitive knowledge as a part of this complex mental state. But we do have the basis—the two ideas—for the agreement expressed by the proposition Locke uses in IV.i.7: We have an idea of existence agreeing to an idea of an object.67\n",

            "At this point, two crucial distinctions must be made and kept in mind. First, although whenever we perceive an idea of an object, we experience that idea as of something existing outside the mind, that supposition holds up only with respect to real and adequate ideas of sensation. “Real” and “adequate” ideas, for Locke, are technical terms describing both a causal and a representational relation between some real existence and my idea. In Locke’s theory of representation, real and adequate ideas actually do correspond to the real existence of their causes.68 The supposition, however, does not hold up with respect to “fantastical or Chimerical” ideas. We will see why in just a moment. Second, perceiving an idea that in fact does correspond to\n",
            "\n",
            "something existing external to me does not also mean that the external thing has either present, or actual, outer existence. Present, or actual, existence would imply something more: that there is something outside or external to me at this moment causing my idea. Consider these two distinctions in this example: If I close my eyes and think about a cat, I am not presently or actually sensing it. Nevertheless, when I think about a cat, I consider or suppose (or experience) the idea to be of a real cat existing at some place or some time. Maybe it is an idea of a chimerical or fictional cat, say, one with a horn in the front of its head, in which case my supposition turns out false. Or maybe the cat I am thinking of is the black one named “Cartman” that I left at home this morning, a really existing cat, one with which I am in some sort of causal relation. In this case, my supposition turns out to be true. In neither case, though, for Locke, am I justified in claiming that the cat I am thinking of is presently, or actually, external to me in this moment causing my idea. In order to make these additional claims, the other elements of an instance of sensitive knowledge must be added in.\n",
            "\n",
            "Importantly, though, for now, we have the foundation for the agreement perceived (the true proposition known) in an instance of sensitive knowledge: Owing to the idea of an object and an idea of existence we have in the mind an idea as of an existing (outer) object. That is, owing to the complexity of the mental state in perceiving an idea of an object, we have an experience of an idea as of an existing object. I suggest that this is what Locke means when he begins the IV.ii.14 analysis of sensitive knowledge with the claim that we can be certain that we have in the mind an idea of an external object—not just an idea of an object, but of an external object. But notice that Locke makes this claim prior to questioning whether there really is an external object causing the idea. Thus, he must be thinking, and quite naturally so, that merely having an idea of an external object in the mind is not sufficient for sensitive knowledge. More justification is needed. Also, importantly, we have shown that sensitive knowledge satisfies the definition of knowledge as the perception of ideational agreement, understood propositionally, although we have yet to include all of the state of affairs constituting that knowledge and expressed in the complete proposition. We can now, as it were, build the state of affairs and thus the proposition from the bottom up by including the other elements on our list of Locke’s commitments until we have the complete state of affairs expressed in the proposition he uses in IV.i.7 to describe what we know when we have sensitive knowledge. Thus, we will see how each of the other of Locke’s commitments (the externalist justificatory element, the internalist justificatory element, and the present affectation of the senses) plays a role in having sensitive knowledge.\n",

            "Another way to see it is to say that we have now partially satisfied the agreement described in an instance of sensitive knowledge: “actual real Existence agreeing to an Idea” (IV.i.7). As we have seen, included along with an idea of an object is an idea of existence, giving me the experience of my idea as of an external object. But other conditions must be met in order to be able to say whether that object really exists or whether it actually/presently exists, namely those further features we see described in\n",

For now, simply note how Locke’s account of sensitive knowledge grows out of his account of how we know our own ideas. Because perceptual states are complex, we can have various forms of knowledge depending on the constituents of the mental state. Every perceptual state includes the original idea perceived, an idea of existence, and consciousness. No matter what the original idea perceived is, having these three constituents in the mind results in intuitive knowledge of the idea and of my existence. We now see that the same three constituents (as long as other conditions are also met) lead to an instance of sensitive knowledge. Let us move now to those other conditions justifying an instance of sensitive knowledge.\n",

            "### 3.II.3 From an Idea of an Object to the Real Existence of the Object As in the other two cases of knowing a particular thing (individual ideas and ourselves), we are explaining a state of affairs that is also the state of the proposition known. In an instance of sensitive knowledge of a particular external object that state of affairs begins with having an idea of an object and taking that object to be as of something external to me, which is expressed in the proposition that existence agrees to any idea. (Note that this proposition is embedded in the more complex one Locke is committed to in his IV.i.7 definition of the agreement known: “that of actual real Existence agreeing to any Idea.”) But there is nothing in the state of affairs expressed in the truncated proposition at this point precluding that the idea has no basis in a reality existing outside of us, even though we might experience it that way. So, let us consider, first, how we get from the perception of an idea of an object considered as external to us to the real existence of the object, one step farther to filling out the agreement perceived and the proposition known in having sensitive knowledge. I suggest that incorporating Locke’s commitment to an externalist justificatory element in having knowledge permits us to take that step.\n",

Our Knowledge therefore is real, only so far as there is a conformity between our Ideas and the reality of Things. But what shall here be the Criterion? How shall the Mind, when it perceives nothing but its own Ideas, know that they agree with Things themselves?

Notice, and this is important, that when our ideas can be said to conform to real things, it is because they satisfy certain factual conditions.

For in simple Ideas, . . . the Mind is wholly confined to the Operations of things upon it; and can make to it self no simple Idea, more than what it has received.” And in II.xxxi.1, Locke describes adequate ideas as those “which perfectly represent” those things the mind supposes them taken from. A simple idea “cannot but be adequate, since it ought only to answer that power” that produced it (II.xxxi.2).

            "### 3.II.3.1 Why simple ideas of sensation conform to their causes Locke explains that simple ideas of sensation are a part of the natural response we have to being affected by things through our senses. Such is the way in which God has created us: When external things impinge on us, we perceive simple ideas of primary and secondary qualities. They are “ordained by our Maker, to produce in us such Sensations; they are real Ideas in us, whereby we distinguish the Qualities, that are really in things themselves” (II.xxx.2). Because simple ideas of sensation are divinely designated effects of external causes affecting the senses, in performing their function, they necessarily correspond to those causes (things) they are designated to represent: For these several Appearances, being designed to be the Marks, whereby we are to know, and distinguish Things, which we have to do with; our Ideas do as well serve us to that purpose, and are as real distinguishing Characters, whether they be only constant Effects, or else exact Resemblances of something in the things themselves: the reality lying in that steady correspondence, they have with the distinct Constitutions of real Beings. But whether they answer to those Constitutions, as to Causes, or Patterns, it matters not; it suffices, that they are constantly produced by them. And thus our simple Ideas are all real and true, because they answer and agree to those Powers of Things, which produce them in our Minds, and that being all that is requisite to make them real, and not fictions at Pleasure. (II.xxx.2) The conformity to reality enjoyed by simple ideas, then, has nothing to do with how well they actually resemble the things for which they serve as marks. In fact, that a particular idea distinguishes a particular cause is in some respects an arbitrary decision of God’s. Rather, conformity consists in the regularity of the correspondence of an effect (idea) to a cause (power of a thing to produce the idea). So simple ideas mark the existence of the powers of real things to produce in us those ideas. As Locke states, they are “the Marks, whereby we are to know, and distinguish Things, which we have to do with.” Simple ideas correspond to really existing things as effects regularly correspond to causes, while “fantastical” ideas “have no Foundation in Nature, nor have any Conformity with that reality of Being, to which they are tacitly referr’d, as to their Archetypes” (II.xxx.1). Because fantastical ideas do not enjoy a “steady correspondence” with those things they are taken to correspond to, they cannot be said to conform to reality.\n",

Indeed, the kind of relation Locke is talking about in his discussion of how adequate ideas conform to their archetypes fits awkwardly (if at all) with his discussion of the way in which our simple ideas of primary and secondary qualities do (or do not) resemble those qualities/powers in the objects causing our ideas.\n",

Because, being intended to express nothing but the power in Things to produce in the Mind such a Sensation, that Sensation, when it is produced, cannot but be the Effect of that Power. So the Paper I write on, having the Power in the Light (I speak according to the common Notion of Light,) to produce in me the Sensation which I call White, it cannot but be the Effect of such a Power in something without the Mind; since the Mind has not the Power to produce any such Idea in it self, and being meant for nothing else but the Effect of such a Power, that simple Idea is real and adequate: the Sensation of White, in my Mind, being the Effect of that Power, which is in the Paper to produce it, is perfectly adequate to that Power; or else that Power would produce a different Idea.

And so each Sensation answering the Power, that operates on any of our Senses, the Idea so produced, is a real Idea, (and not a fiction of the Mind, which has no power to produce any simple Idea;) and cannot but be adequate, since it ought only to answer that power: and so all simple Ideas are adequate.

Of course, we do not usually experience being affected through the senses by each power/quality of the object individually. This might be why in explaining the individuality of simple ideas, Locke speaks of “the coldness and hardness, which a Man feels in a piece of Ice,” “the Smell and Whiteness of a Lily,” and “the taste of Sugar, and smell of a Rose” (II.ii.1). Moreover, and importantly, Locke thinks simple ideas enter the mind together, at the same time. For example, “Sight and Touch often take in from the same Object, at the same time, different Ideas; as a Man sees at once Motion and Colour; the hand feels Softness and Warmth in the same piece of Wax” (II.ii.1). So, even though our experience is of a whole external object affecting the senses, really it is a collection of occurrent simple ideas of sensation, all of which representationally capture their causes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Locke seems to say as much in this passage about the scope of sensitive knowledge: But this Knowledge extends as far as the present Testimony of our Senses, employ’d about particular Objects, that do then affect them, and no farther. For if I saw such a collection of\n",
            "\n",
            "simple Ideas as is wont to be called a Man, existing together one minute since, and am now alone, I cannot be certain, that the same Man exists now, since there is no necessary connexion of his Existence a minute since, with his Existence now. (IV.xi.9)\n",
            "\n",
            "On my view, I have sensitive knowledge insofar as I am perceiving the “collection of simple Ideas as is wont to be called” an external object, namely the occurrent simple ideas of sensation. In some cases, I may perceive only a portion of the possible simple sensory ideas producible by any given object, say only the coldness and hardness, but not the bluish color of the piece of ice. In that moment, I have sensitive knowledge of whatever has the power to produce in me those particular simple ideas. Note that Locke makes this distinction himself in the passage above from IV.xi.2. Therefore, for Locke, we have sensitive knowledge only when we are perceiving occurrent ideas of sensation—when we are actually being affected through the senses.\n",
            "\n",
            "Second, just as we have externalist justification that the simple ideas of sensation collected in our idea of an object correspond to a real existence, Locke thinks that we also have internalist justification. To understand better how we have first-personal (internal) justification, let us turn to Locke’s own description of our experience in having sensitive knowledge. As discussed earlier, Locke begins his IV.ii.14 discussion of it by differentiating sensitive knowledge from intuitive and demonstrative knowledge. As well as the “Knowledge . . . of general Truths” that come by way of intuition and demonstration, “There is,” Locke says, “indeed, another Perception of the Mind, employ’d about the particular existence of finite Beings without us” (IV.ii.14). Sensitive knowledge consists in knowing that there exists a particular external object—or at least something to produce an idea of one. Locke’s explanation proceeds as follows.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, “There can be nothing more certain, than that the Idea we receive from an external Object is in our Minds; this is intuitive Knowledge” (IV.ii.14). When we have an idea as of an external object we know that we do. We have intuitive knowledge of the idea. But on what grounds are we justified in claiming that that idea corresponds to something really existing external to us right now? Here is Locke’s answer: But yet here, I think, we are provided with an Evidence that puts us past doubting: For I ask any one, Whether he be not invincibly conscious to himself of a different Perception, when he looks on the Sun by day, and thinks on it by night; when he actually tastes Wormwood, or smells a Rose, or only thinks on that Savour, or Odour? We as plainly find the difference there is between any Idea revived in our Minds by our own Memory, and actually coming into our Minds by our Senses, as we do between any two distinct Ideas. (IV.ii.14)\n",
            "\n",
            "One way to read this passage is to say that, when compared, ideas of sensation feel different to us than do ideas from memory. Then, on the basis of that knowledge we can draw an inference to the existence of the object.77 But remember that sensitive knowledge arises only when there is an occurrent idea of sensation—only when we are\n",
            "\n",
            "actually sensing. Therefore, the “evidence” Locke speaks of in this passage must be the result of, and so available only when we are, perceiving an occurrent sensory idea.\n",
            "\n",
            "I suggest that Locke’s response is that we already have an internalist form of justification for sensitive knowledge in the perception of the idea of the object itself. It is a part of the complex mental state. That is, “whilst” I perceive an occurrent idea of the sun (or to use Locke’s example, “whilst” the paper in front of me is affecting my eyes (IV.xi.2)), I cannot but experience the idea as originating in my senses.78 In such a case, I am conscious of the idea (the apparent intrinsic features of it) as from sensation.\n",

            "I need not make an additional inference to the present existence of the object.79\n",
            "\n",
            "Similarly, I would just know that when I am thinking of the sun later that evening I am remembering the sun. I am conscious of the idea as from memory. Remember what Locke says about memory: “the Mind has a Power . . . to revive Perceptions, which it has once had, with this additional Perception annexed to them, that it has had them before” (II.x.2). Evidence that by the “additional perception” Locke means consciousness is found in I.iv.20: For to remember is to perceive any thing with memory, or with a consciousness, that it was known or perceived before: without this, whatever Idea comes into the mind is new, and not remembered: This consciousness of it having been in the mind before, being that, which distinguishes Remembring from all other ways of Thinking.\n",

            "Consciousness as internal to the perception of the revived idea accounts for our occurrent experience of the idea as from memory. Likewise, consciousness as internal to the perception of an occurrent idea of sensation accounts for our experience of the idea as from sensation. In being conscious of myself as perceiving the idea, I am conscious of the manner of perception. Moreover, this distinction between my experience of sensing, say, the sun, and remembering it later that night cannot be due to the object of the perception, since both ideas are of the sun. Both perceptions are of ideas of a really existing sun. Therefore, I have epistemic evidence for sensitive knowledge in my consciousness of the way of perceiving. That there actually exists something external to me affecting my senses is experienced as internal to the perception of the occurrent sensory idea. Because consciousness is a constituent of a perception of an idea, it is a part of the complex mental state. This ability to detect the sources of our ideas is not unfamiliar to contemporary cognitive scientists. Such experience of identifying phenomenal characteristics concerning what sort of mental state we are in, or where our mental states are coming from, as a part of that mental state itself is often called “source-monitoring.” According to Johnson (1998: 181),\n",

On my view, it is the complex mental state that is the perception of an occurrent idea of sensation that conveys sensitive knowledge.\n",
            "\n",
            "That consciousness is responsible for our experience of the way of perceiving gains support a few lines later when Locke concludes the IV.ii.14 description of sensitive knowledge with the following passage: So that, I think, we may add to the two former sorts of Knowledge, this also, of the existence of particular external Objects, by that perception and Consciousness we have of the actual entrance of Ideas from them, and allow these three degrees of Knowledge, viz. Intuitive, Demonstrative, and Sensitive: in each of which, there are different degrees and ways of Evidence and Certainty. (IV.ii.14)\n",
            "\n",
            "Sensitive knowledge is due to the “perception and Consciousness we have of the actual entrance of Ideas.” We should take this passage to confirm the interpretation put forward. Because we are conscious of our ideas as having different sources, namely as being in the mind by different ways of perception, sensitive knowledge enjoys a degree of certainty that qualifies it as a species of knowledge. In addition, Locke says, “Where-ever the Mind perceives the Agreement or Disagreement of any of its Ideas, there be certain knowledge” (IV.ii.2). So perceiving the idea as from sensation is a part of the agreement constituting sensitive knowledge. Therefore, when we perceive an occurrent idea as of an external object (an occurrent collection of real and adequate simple ideas of sensation), we are justified in claiming that the real existence captured in the idea is presently (actually) affecting our senses. Insofar as we are experiencing that complex mental state, we know the agreement constituting an instance of sensitive knowledge.\n",

That this idea (insofar as it is a collection of simple sensory ideas) is “real” and “adequate” provides a form of externalist justification that the existence we are talking about is “real Existence agreeing to any Idea.” That the occurrent idea as of an external object is consciously experienced as from sensation provides a form of internalist justification that the real existence we are talking about is “actual real Existence agreeing to any Idea,” which is\n",

            "So that there is no confusion, let me acknowledge that implied in this interpretation is that sensitive knowledge is non-inferential.81 Sensitive knowledge does not require an inference from an idea to the existence of an external object. Consistent with knowing our own ideas and knowing ourselves, I am again relying on Locke’s “one-act” view of knowledge wherein knowing agreements does not require a separate act of the mind: perceiving the agreement, forming the proposition, and knowing it to be true are all achieved as a part of the same mental act. Moreover, we know agreements internal to the perception of an idea because those perceptions are complex mental states with constituent agreeing elements: an idea perceived, an idea of existence, and consciousness. Perceptions of ideas are complex propositional states. As already established, as the result of this complexity when I perceive any idea, I have intuitive knowledge of the idea and of my own existence. When the idea perceived is an occurrent idea of sensation, in addition, I have sensitive knowledge, namely knowledge of the actual real existence of the particular object represented by the idea, or more accurately, by the collection of simple sensory ideas. Therefore, the role of consciousness as a constituent of a more complex mental state makes possible that we are able to have knowledge of particular things, namely perceive the agreements in knowing an individual idea, in knowing our own existence, and in knowing the existence of a particular finite thing outside of me as Locke describes them. And knowing these agreements is fully consistent with his general definition of knowledge. The complexity of the mental state that is the perception of an idea and the role consciousness plays in it allow for a coherent and unified account of how, for Locke, we can have knowledge of particular things.82 In part III, I will provide more argumentation that sensitive knowledge is non-inferential as well as address the consequences of such a view.\n",

            "preliminary replies now and reserve for part III a full examination of how Locke’s account of sensitive knowledge includes a textually and philosophically satisfactory reply to the skeptical challenge. First, Locke himself does not seem to think sensitive knowledge is immune to an evil demon doubt. In response to more pressure from the skeptic after his explanation that our experience of sensing provides sufficient “evidence” for sensitive knowledge, he replies: If any one say, a Dream may do the same thing, and all these Ideas may be produced in us, without any external Objects; he may please to dream that I make him this Answer: 1. That ’tis no great matter, whether I remove his Scruple, or no: Where all is but Dream, Reasoning and Arguments are of no use, Truth and Knowledge nothing. (IV.ii.14)\n",
            "\n",
            "I take Locke to be saying that the global skeptical question has little import for his account of sensitive knowledge, since if it is true, then his entire empiricist enterprise to discover the limits of knowledge is irrelevant.\n",
            "\n",
            "Second, that I have not rendered sensitive knowledge immune to the global skeptic would not place my interpretation in any worse shape than other recent attempts to explain the nature of the agreement.83 Moreover, one might want to think mine better, since it is consistent with Locke’s definition of knowledge as the perception of an agreement of ideas (the perception of a true proposition) and with his expression of that agreement as an “actual real Existence agreeing to an Idea.”84 It also has the added advantage that it incorporates all that Locke says about how our ideas are in relation to an external world and how we come to have knowledge of it—both the externalist and internalist justificatory elements. What is more, it explains how the state of affairs guaranteeing the truth of the proposition known is also the composition or structure of the true proposition itself. And the interpretation comes at no cost. In addition, it does all of that not only in a way consistent with the role of consciousness in Locke’s model of the mind, but also by showing that Locke can be seen to have a coherent and unified account of all three cases in which we have non-inferential knowledge of particular things. Furthermore, contrary to some recent interpretations, mine is consistent with Locke’s explicit claims that we have sensitive knowledge only when we are being presently affected through the senses, only when we are perceiving occurrent ideas of sensation. I will have more to say about this in section II.5.\n",

In addition, I have shown why sensitive knowledge is expressed as “actual real Existence agreeing to an idea,” even though it is a case of ideational agreement. In part III of this chapter, I will fill out my interpretation of Locke’s account of sensitive knowledge by showing why sensitive knowledge, even though non-inferential, is a less certain form of knowledge falling somewhere between the certainty of demonstrative knowledge and probability. I will also provide more explanation why it makes sense that Locke includes a series of probabilistic arguments in support of it.\n",

            "### 3.II.5 Locke’s Reply to Stillingfleet Before we move on, I should provide some analysis of a passage that has become quite famous from the Correspondence with Stillingfleet where Locke seems to state the agreement perceived in sensitive knowledge: Now the two ideas, that in this case are perceived to agree, and do thereby produce knowledge, are the idea of actual sensation (which is an action whereof I have a clear and distinct idea) and the idea of actual existence of something without me that causes that sensation. (Works, IV: 360)\n",
            "\n",
            "Recently, contrary to what I am arguing here, some have interpreted “the idea of actual sensation” as a reflective idea of sensation (an idea of reflection) and “the idea of actual existence of something without me that causes that sensation” as an idea of an external cause.85 I think there are two reasons to be suspicious that Locke is not as careful as he should have been in his reply to Stillingfleet, for this reading of “idea of actual sensation” conflicts with passages already cited in the Essay and even with a preceding passage in the Correspondence with Stillingfleet itself. Let us see why. Were we to see “the idea of actual sensation” as a reflective idea, three interpretations are possible, none of which comes without significant cost. On the one hand, the reflective idea can be generated just after having the idea of sensation. That is, immediately following the perception of an idea of sensation there would be a reflection on that mental operation of sensing resulting in the reflective idea of sensation. Having to reflect on my present sensation in order to generate the “idea of actual sensation” would require an additional mental act following the experience of sensing itself. But this reading contradicts those passages in which Locke states that we have sensitive knowledge in the moment, or only when, we are being presently affected through the senses.86\n",
            "\n",
            "On the other hand, we could interpret Locke as saying that the (reflective) idea of actual sensation is brought into contemporaneity with the idea of the external cause.\n",
            "\n",
            "But then the idea would be of a past experience of sensing, namely from memory, which is something Locke emphatically denies in a statement to Stillingfleet just prior to the passage cited above: But if you had been pleased to have considered my answer there to the sceptics, whose cause you seem, with no small vigour, to manage; you would, I humbly conceive, have found that you mistake one thing for another, viz. the idea that has by a former sensation been lodged in the mind, for actually receiving any idea, i.e. actual sensation. (Works, IV: 360)\n",
            "\n",
            "Here Locke is clear that he does not mean “actual sensation” to refer to a reflective idea that has been generated at some other time and retrieved from memory, namely an “idea that has by a former sensation been lodged in the mind” (my emphasis). Rather, he seems to confirm that “actual sensation” refers to an occurrent idea of sensation.\n",
            "\n",
            "On the third hand, one can argue as does Nagel (forthcoming) that in being conscious of a sensory idea there is occurrently generated a reflective idea of sensation, which if successful would escape my other two objections.87 I do not, however, think it is successful, for in making that argument Nagel has identified consciousness with the mental operation of reflection, which results in a textual conflict between Locke’s claims that all perception is conscious (II.i.19, II.i.25), but young children do not yet have ideas of reflection (II.i.8). So Nagel must find herself either contradicting Locke’s explicit position concerning the reflective abilities of young children or as denying that young children have sensitive knowledge. Recognizing that Locke disallows reflection in young children, Nagel (forthcoming) takes the second route: “It is a consequence of the view suggested here that very small children with no ideas of reflection whatsoever will not have sensitive knowledge; to the extent that very small children are poor judges of the distinction between reality and fantasy this might not be an unwelcome result.” But this solution is unavailable to Nagel, for her interpretation actually entails that young children have sensitive knowledge. The reason is that Locke is committed to the view that young children have what in II.i.25 he calls “obscure Notions” of their own thinking. And Nagel explicitly equates these “obscure Notions” with the reflective ideas that guarantee sensitive knowledge. Let me try to clarify this point.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, consider again what Locke says in II.i.25: When the Objects of our Senses, do, many of them, obtrude their particular Ideas upon our minds, whether we will or no: And the Operations of our minds will not let us be without at least some obscure Notions of them. No man can be totally ignorant of what he does when he thinks. (II.i.25)\n",
            "\n",
            "Locke’s claim that “no man,” namely no one, “can be ignorant of what he does when he thinks” is just his view that all thinking, regardless of the thinker, is conscious.\n",

            "Because young children are conscious, they must be having ideas of reflection— contrary to Locke’s view.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next, consider Nagel’s view. After citing the famous IV.ii.14 passage in which Locke claims that we can just tell the difference between an occurrent sensation of the sun and a memory of the sun, Nagel explicitly equates the “obscure Notions” in II.\n",

Earlier in the Essay Locke had advanced the milder claim that “the operations of our minds, will not let us be without, at least some obscure Notions of them” (2.1.25); it now seems that even these obscure notions must always be distinct enough that there is no risk of our mistaking recollection for sensation. The perception one enjoys when seeing the sun is different from the perception involved in recollecting it, not in virtue of any of the sensible qualities the sun is represented as having, but in virtue of one’s own current mode of thought, of the operations of one’s mind.\n",

            "The operations of the mind generate what Locke calls ideas of reflection. (Nagel forthcoming) By identifying the “obscure Notions” with ideas of reflection, namely that which notifies us that the perception is one from sensation rather than recollection, Nagel has identified the operation of reflection with the consciousness we all have of all our own thinking. Therefore, Nagel’s attempt to avoid the problem that young children do not reflect is unsuccessful. For she cannot accept the conclusion that young children do not have sensitive knowledge without also undercutting her argument that the ability to tell the difference between an occurrent idea of sensation and one from recollection is due to an occurrently generated idea of reflection.\n",
            "\n",
            "One more reason why I interpret Locke’s use of “actual sensation” in the first passage cited above from the Correspondence with Stillingfleet as referring to the way in which we experience an occurrent idea of sensation is due to Locke’s apparent acknowledgment of just such a reading a few lines later. He says, I cannot but fear, my Lord, that what you have said here in favour of scepticism, against certainty by sense (for it is not all against me, till you show we can have no idea of actual sensation) without the proper antidote annexed, in showing wherein that certainty consists. (Works, IV: 360)\n",
            "\n",
            "I take the “proper antidote annexed” to refer to our consciousness of the way of perceiving an occurrent idea of sensation. So, we do not need a reflective idea of sensing to provide the experience of “actual sensation.” Rather, as Locke tells us in both his II.x.ii account of memory and in his IV.ii.14 account of sensitive knowledge, consciousness as “annexed” to any act of perception allows for an experience of an\n",

            "\n",
            "How, then, should we see Locke’s reply to Stillingfleet’s query about the ideas perceived in an instance of sensitive knowledge? Well, I suggest we see it as I have argued. Indeed, Locke’s reply to Stillingfleet is reconciled once we see that all the elements necessary to the agreement in sensitive knowledge are contained therein, even if Locke mixes up the words a bit. The “idea of actual sensation” is an occurrent idea of an object that necessarily includes both externalist and internalist forms of justification that there really and actually is “something without me that causes that sensation.” In addition, there is an idea that that something exists.\n",
            "\n",
            "What we have in Locke’s response to Stillingfleet, although in slightly jumbled form, is a description of an agreement of ideas consisting in various elements (a state of affairs) that together are expressed in the proposition “actual real Existence agreeing to any Idea.” 3.II.6 Conclusion In this part of chapter three, I have argued that Locke has a textually consistent and coherent understanding of the agreement perceived in an instance of sensitive knowledge. We now see why sensitive knowledge can be seen as a legitimate form of knowledge, namely the perception of an agreement of ideas. In addition, I have shown the importance of consciousness and the complexity of our mental states and their contribution to understanding how Locke can think we perceive an agreement of ideas that is also characterized as knowing an actual real existence agreeing to an idea. Consistent with my interpretations of how we have knowledge of other particular things (individual ideas and our own existence), the trio of elements in every perception of an idea provides the mental state of affairs expressed in the relevant true propositions describing those forms of knowledge.\n",
            "\n",
            "Moreover, because consciousness is a constituent of every act of perception, in perceiving ideas we are aware of aspects of those perceptions that contribute what we experience in having sensitive knowledge. Furthermore, I have provided an interpretation of sensitive knowledge that is consistent with Locke’s philosophical psychology. Thus, I do not encounter the problems arising in interpretations that see Locke’s account of sensitive knowledge as isolated from a coherent account of his model of the mind.\n",

Thus, we will also understand why Locke would see it as having a degree of certainty, but a degree of certainty less than what we find in either demonstrative or intuitive knowledge.\n",
            "\n",
            "## PART III Sensitive Knowledge and the Skeptical Challenge Now that we have an account of the agreement in sensitive knowledge, we are left with the task of figuring out how Locke’s theory of sensitive knowledge addresses the skeptical challenge as introduced at the very beginning of part II. It is uncontroversial to say that Locke’s treatment of the skeptical problem is considered by most to be inadequate. Locke is often accused of having an “insouciant” attitude toward the problem, which is even more puzzling given his textual commitments to a representational theory of perception with the ensuing “veil of ideas.” If ideas are the immediate objects of perception, and knowledge is internal to ideas, then why would he want to insist that we have sensitive knowledge at all? More natural would be to take the skeptical problem seriously by concluding that all we really achieve is highly probable judgment that the causes of our ideas really do exist when we are sensing them. But he does not. Locke claims that sensitive knowledge is a species of knowledge with a degree of certainty. What is more, although Locke claims that sensitive knowledge counts as a species of knowledge, rather than a species of judgment, he also seems to offer a series of probabilistic arguments in defense of sensitive knowledge. But the proper role for probabilistic arguments in Locke’s scheme of things is to support judgment, not knowledge. If Locke really thinks that we have some sort of knowledge of the external world, then what work does he see the probabilistic arguments doing? And if he intends the probabilistic arguments as epistemic justification for sensitive knowledge, then why does he consider it knowledge and why does he not take the skeptic more seriously?\n",
            "\n",
            "We can, fortunately, answer these questions and, indeed, show that Locke’s theory of knowledge allows for a consistent, interesting, and philosophically satisfactory reply to the skeptic. To get started, notice that we can see the skeptical challenge in two ways.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, we can see the skeptic as asking how we can know the existence of external things.\n",
            "\n",
            "Second, we can see the skeptic as asking more specifically how we can know inferentially of the existence of external things. That is, given a representational theory of perception, what reason do we have to think that the ideas we perceive really do represent an\n",
            "\n",
            "external world? I have argued that Locke’s account of sensitive knowledge provides an answer to the first question, which reveals that the second question is based on a false presupposition. The reason is that sensitive knowledge, for Locke, is a form of noninferential knowledge. We know the agreement constituting sensitive knowledge as internal to the perception of an idea due to the complexity of our perceptual states. As far as the existence of particular outer things is concerned, all we can achieve by inference is highly probable judgment. Therefore, the probabilistic arguments Locke provides should not be understood as Locke’s defense of the claim that sensitive knowledge counts as knowledge. Rather they should be seen more as Locke describes them—as “concurrent” reasons to shore up what we already sensitively (noninferentially) know. It is unusual, I admit, to speak of buttressing knowledge with probabilistic arguments. But it is also unusual, as Locke has it, for knowledge to come in degrees according to certainty and for one of those degrees to fall somewhere in between probability and knowledge proper. Locke’s reply to the skeptical challenge, I suggest, is found in his analysis of the different degrees of knowledge.\n",

            "Interpreting sensitive knowledge as non-inferential, though, seems to saddle Locke with an internal incoherence, a potential problem that, as promised, I will now address. Unfortunately, despite Locke’s claims that we actually do have “knowledge of the real existence of particular finite beings without us” (IV.ii.14, IV.xi.3), and the arguments marshaled so far in defense of the agreement and how we perceive it, he seems to have left no logical space for it. Agreements perceived immediately (without intervening ideas) are intuitive, while agreements perceived mediately (requiring intervening ideas) are demonstrative. Locke seems to be aware of the problem in IV.ii.14, when he states “These two, (viz.) Intuition and Demonstration, are the degrees of our Knowledge; whatever comes short of one of these, with what assurance soever embraced, is but Faith, or Opinion, but not Knowledge.” He then adds, “at least in all general Truths,” which suggests that when the proposition is not general, as would be the case with a proposition asserting the real existence of a particular external object, it can count as knowledge although it falls short of intuition and demonstration. But still Locke has gained no ground.\n",
            "\n",
            "The problem for the scholarship is that it seems impossible to maintain coherently that there can be three kinds of knowledge when there are only two ways in which agreements can be perceived, immediately, which is intuitive knowledge, and with the help of intervening ideas, which is demonstrative knowledge.88 Others have tried to address this difficulty in different ways. Newman (2004, 2007: 325) argues that in sensitive knowledge there are two different cognitions: “an idea of sensation stands in dual cognitive relations: it stands both in a perceived agreement with another idea, and\n",
            "\n",
            "in a causal relation with an external cause. Though cognition of the former relation explains why sensitive knowledge ‘passes under the name of Knowledge,’ cognition of the latter relation is integral and yet could pass for nothing stronger than probable judgment.” As noted by Rickless (2008: 91), Newman’s interpretation is philosophically shaky because it runs contrary to Locke’s emphatic philosophical distinction between knowledge and probable judgment or opinion. In addition, that there are “dual cognitive relations” in the same act of knowledge is textually thin. Nagel (forthcoming) argues that the agreement perceived—what constitutes knowledge—consists in “an agreement between the reflective idea of sensation and the idea of the real existence of an outer cause.” The reason why sensitive knowledge is less certain is that the “connection between the central content presented to one’s mind (in this case, the idea of the rose [external object]) and one’s idea of one’s mode of thought (in this case, the [reflective] idea of actual sensation) . . . is one of mere temporal coincidence.” For Allen (2013: 262), sensitive knowledge is less certain, because “even when we are actually receiving ideas from without, a particular kind of doubt remains possible. . . . Whereas reason is employed about the ‘clear and abstract Ideas of our own Minds’ (E IV.xi.3), the reflective awareness of receiving ideas from without can be rendered indistinct and obscure by a failure to attend carefully to our own mental lives.” I pointed to problems I see with Nagel’s and Allen’s interpretations in part II of this chapter.\n",
            "\n",
            "I have argued that the agreement in sensitive knowledge is perceived immediately (non-inferentially), and I think there is a relatively easy way to allow three kinds of knowledge when there are only two ways of perceiving agreements. All that is needed is a slight change in taxonomy. Had Locke been more careful about what, in the end, he was committed to, he would (and should) have said the following: (1) all knowledge is the perception of an agreement or disagreement of ideas; (2) there are two ways of perceiving agreements or disagreements of ideas: immediately (non-inferentially) or mediately (inferentially); (3) intuitive and sensitive knowledge fall into the first category, while demonstrative knowledge falls into the second; (4) the degrees of certainty of knowledge can then depend on how well each form of knowledge meets other conditions. (I will argue that the other conditions are further normative conditions.)89 Although this analysis might seem both tendentious and costly to the interpretation, I suggest that all it does is to swap the definitional terms. Instead of using “intuitive” and “demonstrative” to denote ways of perceiving agreements (immediately and mediately), it uses “non-inferential” and “inferential.” Making this interpretive move makes sense of everything Locke says, except his use of “intuitive” exclusively to denote a noninferential perception of an agreement of ideas. This is a more satisfying solution, since it allows Locke all that he wants in his theory of knowledge. He can have his general definition of knowledge that also “allow[s] these three degrees of Knowledge,\n",

            "Here, in part III, I will argue that Locke’s theory of knowledge includes both firstorder psychological and second-order normative conditions.

            "\n",
            "The degree of certainty we have in the different forms of knowledge depends on how well each “degree” of knowledge (intuitive, demonstrative, and sensitive) meets further second-order (reflective) normative conditions. In advancing my case that sensitive knowledge is a form of non-inferential knowledge, I will draw out Locke’s own implicit analogy between intuitive and sensitive knowledge. By comparing both the similarities in the way in which each one meets the psychological conditions and the differences in the way in which they meet normative conditions, I can show why both sensitive and intuitive knowledge are the immediate (non-inferential) perception of an agreement of ideas, but at the same time they do not have the same certainty.\n",

            "Unlike intuitive knowledge, sensitive knowledge does not meet a higher order normative condition. Should I step back from my sensitive knowledge and reflectively ask whether I should still accept what I have just immediately perceived, I can generate a reason for doubt. Hence, sensitive knowledge has a lesser degree of certainty. But it is still knowledge—at least for Locke. Therefore, not all knowledge, for Locke, must meet the same epistemic conditions. The psychological condition, namely the perception of an agreement and the subjective certainty experienced therein, constitutes knowledge.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the degree of certainty of that knowledge depends upon whether (and how well) further epistemic conditions are met. I suggest that the similarities and differences in the degrees of knowledge and the ways in which they meet these conditions constitute Locke’s reply to the skeptical challenge. Although the bulk of the arguments address only intuitive and sensitive knowledge, I will also have something to say about why Locke’s understanding of demonstrative knowledge is consistent with the interpretation I put forward.\n",
            "\n",
            "I have already provided ample textual reasons for attributing to Locke the view that sensitive knowledge counts as a species of knowledge. Let me reiterate some of the main ones here. First, Locke tells us, “We can have Knowledge no farther than we have Ideas” (IV.iii.1). Second, Locke “allow[s] these three degrees of Knowledge, viz.\n",
            "\n",
            "Intuitive, Demonstrative, and Sensitive” (IV.ii.14). Third, sensitive knowledge is a species of the knowledge of “real existence” (IV.i.1, IV.iii.21). Fourth, Locke defines knowledge as “the perception of the connexion and agreement, or disagreement and repugnancy of any of our Ideas” (IV.i.2), and finally, “where-ever the Mind perceives the Agreement or Disagreement of any of its Ideas, there be certain Knowledge” (IV.ii.2). These passages clearly indicate that a necessary and sufficient condition of knowledge (generally) is that there is the perception of an agreement of ideas, and that all knowledge is certain. Furthermore, in part II we saw that Locke’s definition of the agreement in sensitive knowledge can be reconciled with the general definition\n",
            "\n",
            "of knowledge. So, Locke must be thinking that in a case of sensitive knowledge there is an agreement perceived, and it enjoys (at least some degree of) certainty.\n",
            "\n",
            "What is more, I take Locke to be concerned to delimit what he counts as knowledge from what he considers probability. Locke describes his project as one of “search[ing] out the bounds between opinion and knowledge” (I.i.3). He states his purpose “to inquire into the original, certainty, and extent of human knowledge, together with the grounds and degrees of belief, opinion, and assent” (I.i.2). This mission in combination with the above textual statements about what knowledge in general and sensitive knowledge in particular consist in is good evidence that he considers sensitive knowledge to count as knowledge and not a degree of “belief, opinion, and assent.” My concern, now, is only with why, once sensitive knowledge is seen as knowledge, Locke responds to the skeptical challenge as he does. Part III offers a way to understand Locke’s treatment of the skeptical question, given that all knowledge, including sensitive knowledge, is internal to ideas. In addition, the interpretation underscores Locke’s own description of his task, not to show that we can know all that we may want to know, but rather to show that human understanding can provide knowledge sufficient for what we need to know.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3.III.1 Locke’s Epistemic Task To provide an appropriate frame for the interpretation I am advancing, it is helpful to think about the nature of what I am calling Locke’s “epistemic task” in the Essay. In the “Epistle to the Reader,” Locke relates the birth of the Essay. As he tells it, he was discussing matters of important concern with several friends when they came to the realization that they were unable to reach satisfactory solutions. Locke says, After we had a while puzzled our selves, without coming any nearer a resolution of those Doubts which perplexed us, it came to my thoughts that we took a wrong course; and that, before we set our selves upon Enquiries of that Nature, it was necessary to examine our own Abilities, and see, what Objects our Understandings were, or were not fitted to deal with. (Locke 1975: 7) According to the testimony of his contemporary, James Tyrrell, Locke and his friends were discussing matters of morality and revealed religion.90 Locke wanted to know whether the understanding is “fitted to deal with” important issues concerning our knowledge of God and how we ought to live. Are we fit to achieve the practical goals of happiness in this life and the next? Locke’s answer, after all the subsequent hard work in the Essay, is that although there are a number of things we cannot know, such as the nature of substance, the full mechanistic account of nature, and whether thinking substance is material or immaterial, we can know enough to make our way through those puzzling issues that most concern us:\n",
            "\n",
            "For though the Comprehension of our Understandings, comes exceeding short of the vast Extent of Things; yet, we shall have Cause enough to magnify the bountiful Author of our Being, for that Portion and degree of Knowledge, he has bestowed on us, so far above all the rest of the Inhabitants of this our Mansion. Men have reason to be well satisfied with what God hath thought fit for them, since he has given them. . . . Whatsoever is necessary for the Conveniences of Life, and Information of Vertue; and has put within the reach of their Discovery the comfortable Provision for this Life and the Way that leads to a better. How short soever their Knowledge may come of a Universal, or perfect Comprehension of whatsoever is, it yet secures their great Concernments, that they have Light enough to lead them to the Knowledge of their Maker, and the sight of their own duties. (I.i.5)\n",
            "\n",
            "The epistemic task of the Essay is not to gain a “universal comprehension of whatsoever is,” but to discover the limits of our knowledge in order to make sure that we can know what we need to know in order to live a good life now and be rewarded with a better one later. I suggest that Locke’s general point is that the faculties we have are sufficient for pursuing and gaining the kind of knowledge that is crucial to living a good life. Our senses provide enough about external things to stay out of harm’s way and achieve the “conveniences of Life.” Without such abilities, we would be hard-pressed to devote much time to pursuing knowledge of anything else, say, of the existence of “our Maker” and of “our own duties.” Moreover, our mental faculties are sufficient to achieving knowledge beyond what we can know directly from the senses. Locke confirms as much here: The infinite wise Contriver of us, and things about us, hath fitted our Senses, Faculties and Organs, to the conveniences of Life, and the Business we have to do here. We are able, by our Senses, to know, and distinguish things; and to examine them so far, as to apply them to our Uses, and several ways to accommodate the Exigences of this Life.\n",

            ". . . We are furnished with Faculties (dull and weak as they are) to discover enough in the Creatures, to lead us to Knowledge of the Creator, and Knowledge of our Duty; and we are fitted well enough with Abilities, to provide for the Conveniences of living: These are our Business in the World. (II.xxiii.12)\n",
            "\n",
            "Since Locke admits that our knowledge is limited, yet what knowledge we can attain is sufficient for what we need, it makes sense that not all knowledge must reach the highest level of certainty. For the degree of certainty can track the extent to which we are capable of achieving it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Locke’s division of knowledge into three degrees of certainty can be taken as his reply to the skeptic’s charge that we cannot claim to have knowledge of an external world. The reason is that Locke can be seen to employ different cognitive standpoints in his treatment of the certainty of knowledge and so also in his treatment of skepticism. In resting content with the unavoidable certainty in perceptions of agreements of ideas constituting knowledge, yet acknowledging the possibility of a change in one’s epistemic situation upon a reflective consideration, we can make sense of Locke’s claim that sensitive knowledge counts as (a lesser degree of certainty of) knowledge. We can also\n",
            "\n",
            "make sense of his apparent failure to take seriously the skeptical problem. A good way to advance the argument that sensitive knowledge is non-inferential and also elicit the two cognitive standpoints operating in Locke’s account of the degrees of knowledge and how they constitute Locke’s reply to the skeptic begins by seeing the similarities and differences in intuitive and sensitive knowledge. Let us turn now to making explicit Locke’s own implicit analogy between intuitive and sensitive knowledge.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3.III.2 The Similarity of Intuitive and Sensitive Knowledge: The Nature of Intuitive Knowledge We have just seen that there is a structural similarity in knowing our own ideas, knowing our own existence, and knowing the existence of an external object. In all three cases, owing to the complexity of our perceptual states, we know these agreements internal to the perception of an idea. Moreover, these forms of knowledge do not require a mental act in addition to the perception of the idea itself. But sensitive knowledge also shares more general psychological features with all forms of intuitive knowledge, even those general truths in which we know propositions as the result of voluntarily comparing ideas. Three other important similarities emerge between intuitive knowledge generally and sensitive knowledge. First, all intuitive knowledge, like sensitive knowledge, is immediate both logically and temporally. Second, both intuitive and sensitive knowledge are irresistible and unavoidable. And third, Locke seems to think that both resist what he calls an “earnest” skeptical attitude.\n",
            "\n",
            "Establishing the analogy between intuitive and sensitive knowledge serves three purposes. First, it yields further support for the arguments in part I of this chapter by showing that having intuitive knowledge internal to the perception of an idea is consistent with other features common to all cases of intuitive knowledge. Second, it strengthens my arguments in parts I and II by showing that the structural similarity in knowing the agreement in the intuitive knowledge of my own ideas and my own existence, and in an instance of sensitive knowledge, is consistent with other psychological features similar to both intuitive and sensitive knowledge. Third, explicating the additional shared psychological features of intuitive and sensitive knowledge is helpful in distinguishing their dissimilarities, namely answering the crucial question how two forms of non-inferential knowledge can differ in degree of certainty.\n",
            "\n",
            "Let us move on to the analogy. Consider first Locke’s description of the immediacy of intuitive knowledge.91 First, knowing the identity of an idea (as we saw in part I) is\n",
            "\n",
            "an immediate form of knowledge: “A Man infallibly knows, as soon as ever he has them in his Mind that the Ideas he calls White and Round, are the Ideas they are” (IV.i.4). This knowledge is internal to the perception of the idea. But also when Locke explains the nature of intuitive knowledge more generally, he states that we perceive the agreement or disagreement of ideas “immediately by themselves, without the intervention of any other.” Thus, we perceive that White is not Black, That a Circle is not a Triangle, That Three are more than Two, and equal to One and Two. Such kind of Truths the mind perceives at the first sight of the Ideas together, by bare Intuition, without the intervention of any other Idea; and this kind of Knowledge is the clearest, and most certain, that humane Frailty is capable of. (IV.ii.1)\n",
            "\n",
            "Locke seems to be speaking of the “immediacy” of intuitive knowledge in two ways.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, there is logical immediacy in the sense that no other ideas than those originally perceived (or compared) are necessary to know the agreement.92 Indeed, Locke specifically uses the term “immediately” to distinguish this difference between intuitive and demonstrative knowledge. In demonstrative knowledge, “the Mind perceives the Agreement or Disagreement of any Ideas, but not immediately” (IV.ii.2). Demonstrative knowledge, for Locke, is knowledge by proofs, which requires intervening ideas to show the agreement or disagreement of any ideas. “Those intervening Ideas, which serve to shew the Agreement of any two others, are called Proofs; and where the Agreement or Disagreement is by this means plainly and clearly perceived, it is called Demonstration” (IV.ii.3).93 I suggest that we see logical immediacy as a feature of intuitive knowledge generally that distinguishes it from demonstrative knowledge, but not from sensitive knowledge. Therefore, that all intuitive and sensitive knowledge can be seen to share certain features, for example logical immediacy, does not mean that we cannot within Locke’s theory of knowledge distinguish them insofar as they do not share other features.\n",
            "\n",
            "Indeed, I will argue that how well intuitive and sensitive knowledge (as well as demonstrative knowledge) stand up to a reflective challenge is one such distinguishing feature.\n",
            "\n",
            "Second, Locke also seems to think all intuitive knowledge is temporally immediate in the sense that there is no temporal gap between perceiving the ideas and perceiving any agreement or disagreement therein.94 We see this in Locke’s use of temporal terms like “as soon as ever” he has ideas in the mind he has knowledge, “whilst” having an idea we\n",
            "\n",
            "know something, and we have knowledge “without hesitation” to describe how we have intuitive knowledge. Moreover, these two kinds of immediacy seem, for Locke, related.\n",
            "\n",
            "The reason why a form of knowledge is instantaneously self-evident derives from the fact that I know the agreement as a part of perceiving ideas themselves as compared or juxtaposed in the understanding. For example, when I perceive an idea of white and I perceive (compare) an idea of black, logically, I have an immediate knowledge of their disagreement, since I can perceive it without the need for any intervening ideas. What we find in IV.ii.5 provides a good illustration. Here, Locke says, “And so if the Mind have the Faculty of distinct Perception, it will perceive the Agreement or Disagreement of Ideas that produce intuitive Knowledge.” Distinct perception is not enough in cases where the agreement cannot be perceived immediately. Locke says: Thus having the Ideas of an obtuse, and an acute Triangle, both drawn from equal Bases, and between Parallels, I can by intuitive Knowledge, perceive the one not to be the other; but cannot that way know, whether they be equal, or no; because their Agreement, or Disagreement in equality, can never be perceived by an immediate comparing them: The difference of Figure makes their parts uncapable of an exact immediate application; and therefore there is need of some intervening Quantities to measure them by, which is Demonstration, or rational Knowledge. (IV.iii.3)\n",
            "\n",
            "Moreover, when I perceive those ideas together I know instantaneously—“at first sight”—that, for example, “white is not black.” Consider also, again, this passage in which Locke describes our intuitive knowledge of our own ideas: ’Tis the first Act of the Mind, when it has any Sentiments or Ideas at all, to perceive its Ideas, and so far as it perceives them, to know each what it is, and thereby also to perceive their difference, and that one is not another. This is so absolutely necessary, that without it there could be no knowledge, no Reasoning, no Imagination, no distinct Thoughts at all. By this the Mind clearly and infallibly perceives each Idea to agree with it self, and not to be the other: and it does this without any pains, labour, or deduction; but at first view, by its natural power of Perception and Distinction. . . . A Man infallibly knows, as soon as ever he has them in his Mind that the Ideas he calls White and Round, are the Ideas they are, and that they are not other Ideas which he calls Red or Square. (IV.i.4)\n",
            "\n",
            "Here Locke says that when I have a distinct idea, insofar as I perceive that idea, I know what it is, solely by the mind’s natural power of “Perception and Distinction.” As argued in part I, insofar as I perceive any idea distinctly, I know “what it is.” I need not worry that when I perceive the idea “white” or the idea “black” I actually have some other ideas in my mind, say the idea “red” or the idea “round.” Whenever I perceive the idea “white,” I just know “clearly and infallibly” “without any pains, labour, or deduction; but at first view” that I really am perceiving the idea “white.” The intuitive knowledge is described as both logically and temporally immediate.\n",
            "\n",
            "Notice the similarity in Locke’s description of intuitive knowledge as the result of comparing ideas in this next passage. Again, the mind’s natural power of “distinct\n",
            "\n",
            "perception” is operative in the logical and temporal immediacy of intuitive knowledge. As long as this mental faculty is working properly, Locke says we will intuit the appropriate agreement “at first glimpse, without hesitation”: Another difference between intuitive and demonstrative Knowledge, is, that though in the latter all doubt be removed, when by the Intervention of the intermediate Ideas, the Agreement or Disagreement is perceived; yet before the Demonstration there was a doubt, which in intuitive Knowledge cannot happen to the Mind that has its Faculty of Perception left to a degree capable of distinct Ideas, no more than it can be a doubt to the Eye, (that can distinctly see White and Black,) whether this Ink, and this Paper be all of a Colour. If there be Sight in the Eyes, it will at first glimpse, without Hesitation, perceive the Words printed on this Paper, different from the Colour of the Paper: And so if the Mind have the Faculty of distinct Perception, it will perceive the Agreement or Disagreement of those Ideas that produce intuitive Knowledge. If the Eyes have lost the Faculty of seeing, or the Mind of perceiving, we in vain inquire after the quickness of Sight in one, or clearness of Perception in the other. (IV.ii.5)\n",
            "\n",
            "I take Locke to be saying that part of the temporal dimension involved in knowing demonstrative agreements is that the comparison of the ideas itself does not instantaneously result in knowing the agreement as it does in intuitive knowledge. Just as when we see the ink of the printed words juxtaposed with the color of the paper, there is no “hesitation” in perceiving that “the words printed on this paper [are] different from the color of the paper,” when we compare any two ideas minimally necessary to show the agreement, we will equally, without hesitation, “at first view” know that agreement. If nothing else is needed to perceive the agreement, if the idea or ideas are perceived (that is, they appear in the Mind such that the agreement can be perceived), and if the mind’s faculty of perception is functioning properly, then we will with the same “quickness of sight” perceive the agreement. This is no more than to reiterate and provide more textual evidence for Locke’s “one-act” theory of knowledge.\n",
            "\n",
            "Therefore, we should see intuitive knowledge generally as having both logical and temporal immediacy: It involves neither an intervening idea to show the agreement, nor is the knowledge temporally distinguishable from the mental act involved in perceiving the ideas.\n",
            "\n",
            "The description of intuitive knowledge as logically and temporally immediate is also found in Locke’s version of the cogito argument. Consider again this passage, to which I gave considerable focus in part I. He says, “In every Act of Sensation, Reasoning, or Thinking, we are conscious to our selves of our own Being; and, in this Matter, come not short of the highest degree of Certainty” (IV.ix.3). Locke is here stating that we have intuitive knowledge of our own real existence as a component of any perception, thinking, or what is equivalent, having ideas.95 For Locke, there is\n",
            "\n",
            "nothing more than what is involved in a perception of the understanding, which is part and parcel with the knowledge it includes. “For in this [intuitive knowledge], the Mind is at no pains of proving or examining, but perceives the Truth, as the Eye doth light, only by being directed toward it” (IV.ii.1). When I perceive the idea, in that moment, I just know the agreement.\n",
            "\n",
            "Locke continues that intuitive knowledge is “irresistible” and “like the bright Sunshine, forces it self immediately to be perceived, as soon as ever the Mind turns its view that way; and leaves no room for Hesitation, Doubt, or Examination, but the Mind is presently filled with the clear Light of it” (IV.ii.1). Locke seems to be saying that as soon as we are aware of the ideas in our minds we perceive the agreement; intuitive knowledge is “irresistible” to us. It leaves “no room for Doubt or Hesitation.” In the moment of perceiving the agreement we cannot but accept what we perceive: the knowledge is unavoidable. So, just as the brightness of the sun is irresistible to our sight, which means that we cannot but perceive the brightness of the sun in the moment we look at the sun, we cannot but perceive and accept as true those particular agreements when we perceive (look at) those ideas—when they are presented to us in consciousness. Intuitively (non-inferentially) perceived agreements, therefore, have the second analogous feature. They are “irresistible” and unavoidable; they are in a sense forced on us.96 We are “filled with the clear Light” of the knowledge upon perceiving the ideas.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, we come to the third analogous feature. Locke tells us that the intuitive knowledge of the identity (and diversity) of our own ideas, which is of the highest certainty, resists a skeptical attitude: ’Tis on this Intuition, that depends all the certainty and Evidence of our knowledge, which Certainty every one finds to be so great, that he cannot imagine, and therefore not require a greater: For a Man cannot conceive himself capable of a greater Certainty, than to know that any Idea in his Mind is such as he perceives it to be; and that two Ideas, wherein he perceives a difference, are different, and not precisely the same. He that demands a greater Certainty than this, demands he knows not what, and shews only that he has a Mind to be a Sceptick, without being able to be so. (IV.ii.1)\n",
            "\n",
            "The certainty of my intuitive knowledge is derived from the infallibility of the intuition. It makes sense, then, that Locke ends the passage with the claim that I cannot genuinely doubt my intuitive knowledge. I cannot in good faith doubt what is so very clear to me. As Locke puts it, to doubt my intuitive knowledge shows only that I have “a Mind to be a Sceptick, without being able to be so.” I read this point to be that as hard as I might try to adopt a skeptical stance toward my own intuitive knowledge, I cannot rid myself of the certainty I immediately experience whenever I perceive the agreements of those ideas. Furthermore, the certainty of\n",
            "\n",
            "intuitive knowledge is reinforced—I have the same certainty—each time I step back to consider whether what I take to be intuitive knowledge really is intuitive knowledge, namely that “a Circle is not a Triangle, that Three are more than Two, and equal to One and Two” (IV.ii.1). At no time does it seem natural to doubt the certainty of my perception of the idea “white”—that it is as I am perceiving it to be—or that when I perceive the idea “white” and the idea “black”, they are different. To take a skeptical stance toward what is so very certain to me, and even reinforced to me with each reflective challenge, as we have it in Locke’s model of the mind, would be to adopt an attitude to my own experience of which I am “incapable.” So, Locke’s lack of concern for skepticism with respect to intuitive knowledge is not evidence that he ignores the problem, but rather reveals his conviction that when it comes to the nature of these kinds of agreements we cannot get ourselves into a perceptual situation in which the skeptical challenge has any purchase on us.97\n",

            "### 3.III.3 The Similarity of Intuitive and Sensitive Knowledge: The Case for Sensitive Knowledge Let us turn now to Locke’s discussion of sensitive knowledge to see additional ways in which it is analogous to intuitive knowledge. To provide more evidence why we should see sensitive knowledge as a form of non-inferential knowledge and to elicit the two cognitive standpoints essential to differentiating the three degrees of certainty of knowledge, we are looking to establish the same three features in sensitive knowledge: (1) it is immediate in both the logical and temporal senses; (2) it is irresistible, or unavoidable; and (3) it resists a skeptical attitude. I will consider the first two in this section. The third, I will treat in section 3.III.4.\n",
            "\n",
            "Before considering the analogy proper, it is helpful to have in mind the following two points. First, like intuitive and demonstrative knowledge, sensitive knowledge has a degree of certainty that comes with any instance of knowledge. Locke says, “where-ever the Mind perceives the Agreement or Disagreement of any of its Ideas, there be certain knowledge” (IV.ii.2). The agreement perceived in an instance of sensitive knowledge is the agreement of “real existence” with respect to “particular finite beings without us” (IV.xi.3, IV.ii.14). This means that Locke does not understand sensitive knowledge as a form of probable judgment. In probable judgment, “the Mind takes its Ideas to agree, or disagree . . . without perceiving a demonstrative Evidence in the Proofs” (IV.xiv.3).\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "were Locke to consider sensitive knowledge mere probable judgment, there would be no reason for him to assign it a middle degree of certainty falling somewhere between demonstrative knowledge and probability. It would have the degree of certainty of an agreement perceived either intuitively or demonstratively, or a degree of assent due a probable judgment, but not one, as Locke claims, falling somewhere in between. Yet, Locke states clearly not only that sensitive knowledge attains a degree of certainty, but also that “going beyond bare probability, and yet not reaching to either of the foregoing [intuitive and demonstrative] degrees of certainty, [it] passes under the name of knowledge” (IV.ii.14). Therefore, Locke’s account of sensitive knowledge should not be seen as reducible to probable judgment.\n",
            "\n",
            "I am sensitive to the concern that the IV.ii.14 passage just quoted need not be read as I interpret it. Rather, although called “knowledge” by Locke, perhaps sensitive knowledge is better seen as a very high degree of probability falling between “bare probability” and intuitive and demonstrative knowledge. Rickless (2008) argues that not all true propositions are candidates for knowledge. Thus, Locke’s definition of knowledge as “the perception of an agreement or disagreement of ideas” is reconcilable with an account in which what Locke calls the certainty of sensitive knowledge amounts to “what Locke calls ‘assurance’—founded in the highest possible degree of probability” (2008: 85), where “‘assurance’ is used in a very specific, technical sense” (2008: 92).\n",
            "\n",
            "I think Rickless argues forcefully that Locke can be read this way. I disagree, however, that the textual evidence Rickless cites is conclusive, for there is other textual evidence that seems to be in conflict with the view that “assurance” or even “greatest” or “full assurance” is a technical term for the highest degree of probability. For example, in IV.ii.6, Locke uses “full assurance” to describe the certainty of intuitive knowledge: “’Tis true, the Perception, produced by Demonstration, is also very clear; yet it is often with a great abatement of that evident lustre and full assurance, that always accompany that which I call intuitive.” In II.xxxii.6, Locke uses “assurance” as the degree of certainty we have that the truth of relations between general ideas holds in all instances: “therefore, to shorten its way to knowledge, and make each perception more comprehensive, the first thing it does, as the foundation of the easier enlarging its knowledge . . . , is to bind them into bundles, and rank them so into sorts, that what knowledge it gets of any of them it may thereby with assurance extend to all of that sort.” And in IV.viii.3 we find “assurance” equated with “infallibly know”: Let a man abound, as much as the plenty of words which he has will permit, in such propositions as these: “a law is a law,” and “obligation is obligation”; “right is right,” and “wrong is wrong”: will these and the like ever help him to an acquaintance with ethics, or instruct him or others in the knowledge of morality? Those who know not, nor perhaps ever will know, what is right and what is wrong, nor the measures of them, can with as much assurance make, and infallibly know, the truth of these and all such propositions, as he that is best instructed in morality can do. But what advance do such propositions give in the knowledge of anything necessary or useful for their conduct? (IV.viii.3)\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, in this next passage, Locke tells us that the “greatest assurance” comes from intuition and demonstration: In propositions, then, whose certainty is built upon the clear perception of the agreement or disagreement of our ideas, attained either by immediate intuition, as in self-evident propositions, or by evident deductions of reason in demonstrations we need not the assistance of revelation, as necessary to gain our assent, and introduce them into our minds. Because the natural ways of knowledge could settle them there, or had done it already; which is the greatest assurance we can possibly have of anything. (IV.xviii.5)\n",
            "\n",
            "In addition to Locke’s uses of “assurance” to refer to the subjective certainty we have in both intuitive and demonstrative knowledge, he also uses it to denote any degree of assent to a proposition. When talking about the degree to which any “rational Creature” is “a lover of Truth” Locke says, [T]here are very few lovers of Truth for Truth’s sake, even amongst those, who perswade themselves that they are so. How a Man may know whether he be so in earnest is worth enquiry: And I think there is one unerring Mark of it, viz. The not entertaining any Proposition with greater assurance than the Proofs it is built upon will warrant. (IV.19.1)\n",
            "\n",
            "That Locke uses “assurance” to denote any degree of assent to a proposition, indeed, even only a degree of subjective confidence that is less than rational, undercuts the further objection that, in spite of the conflicting texts, Rickless has the best reading of “assurance.”99 Therefore, we should see sensitive knowledge as having a degree of certainty that comes with any form of knowledge.\n",
            "\n",
            "Second, Locke asserts an explicit analogy of intuitive to sensitive knowledge in II.xxiii.15: “For whilst I know, by seeing or hearing, etc. that there is some Corporeal Being without me, the Object of that sensation, I do more certainly know, that there is some Spiritual Being within me, that sees and hears.” Locke clearly seems to be saying that intuitively perceived agreements are quite like sensitively perceived ones. Just as I know that I exist when I am perceiving any idea, I know that there exists a corporeal being when I have an occurrent idea of sensation. Note that in Locke’s own analogy between knowing that “there is some Corporeal Being without me,” a case of sensitive knowledge, and knowing that “there is some Spiritual being within me,” a case of intuitive knowledge, both count as knowledge. Yet, he clarifies, “I do more certainly know” what I know intuitively than what I know sensitively. This lends support to my claim that Locke’s commitments are much better served by first classifying knowledge as either non-inferential or inferential and then applying other conditions to determine the different degrees of certainty. Once I have established that sensitive knowledge, like intuitive knowledge, is logically and temporally immediate, is irresistible, and resists a skeptical attitude, I will provide another argument why sensitive knowledge, although psychologically akin to intuitive knowledge, is not the same as intuitive knowledge: It is,\n",

He then considers the skeptical problem. He says that many go on to question whether in fact we should infer that the idea we know intuitively to be in the mind corresponds to an actual object existing outside of us: But whether there be any thing more certain than barely that Idea in our Minds, whether we can thence certainly infer the existence of any thing without us, which corresponds to that Idea, is that, whereof some Men think there may be a question made, because Men may have such Ideas in their Minds, when no such thing exists, no such Object affects their Senses.

But the point I am arguing here is slightly different. Here I am arguing that Locke himself is drawing a similarity between the ways in which we intuitively and sensitively perceive agreements. He addresses the skeptical question posed in the preceding passage by saying that when we have ideas of external objects as the result of being affected through the senses, we do indeed have enough evidence in the perception of the idea itself (without needing anything else) to put us past doubting that there really exists something external to us producing our ideas. I repeat here the passage cited earlier in part II: But yet here, I think, we are provided with an Evidence that puts us past doubting: For I ask any one, Whether he be not invincibly conscious to himself of a different Perception, when he looks on the Sun by day, and thinks on it by night; when he actually tastes Wormwood, or smells a Rose, or only thinks on that Savour, or Odour. We as plainly find the difference there is between any Idea revived in our Minds by our own Memory, and actually coming into our Minds by our Senses, as we do between any two distinct Ideas.

            "that we are sensing rather than, say, remembering. But then he says, we as “plainly find” the difference in our experience “as we do between any two distinct Ideas.” Note that Locke is stating relatively clearly that the immediacy and certainty of our knowledge that the perception of an idea of the sun is due to sensation rather than due to memory is the same as the immediacy and certainty with which we know intuitively that two ideas are distinct. That is, it is just as immediately (in both the logical and temporal senses) certain to me that my perception of the idea of the sun is from sensation when I am looking at the sun, as it is immediately certain to me that any two ideas are different. Locke seems to be arguing that sensitive knowledge, like intuitive knowledge, is both logically and temporally immediate; it is non-inferential.\n",
            "\n",
            "Moreover, that sensitive knowledge is both logically and temporally immediate implies that it is at the same time irresistible, or psychologically unavoidable. When we are in the right perceptual situation, that is, when the conditions are right to perceive the agreement (our complex mental state includes the perception of an occurrent real and adequate idea as of an external object, which also includes an awareness of the idea as from sensation), we cannot avoid knowing and accepting it.101 Hence, we have the first and second analogous features: sensitive knowledge is immediate and irresistible.\n",
            "\n",
            "Because sensitive knowledge shares the two aforementioned features with intuitive knowledge, I suggest that we interpret Locke’s response to the skeptical concern, namely whether we can infer that there exist objects external to us in the moment we are sensing them, to be that the question is moot. As traditionally conceived, the skeptical question is inappropriate for Locke’s account, because sensitive knowledge does not involve an inference at all: It is both logically and temporally immediate.\n",

            "response to the skeptical concern raised in IV.ii.14, therefore, is that we need not question, as some do, whether on the basis of our sense experiences we are entitled to infer the existence of external objects. The reason is that sensitive knowledge, like intuitive knowledge, is non-inferential. Both kinds of agreements are logically and temporally immediate, and both are psychologically unavoidable; that is, when we perceive the agreeing ideas we just know and are compelled to accept that the agreement obtains.102\n",

            "Given what I have argued, one might think my interpretation commits Locke to the view that a visual hallucination of a pink elephant would count as an instance of sensitive knowledge, for the hallucination would be experienced as having originated in sensation. Unfortunately, Locke’s treatment of the skeptical problem is concerned with only systematic error, such as we have if there is an evil demon or we are locked in a perpetual dream. As is duly discussed by Bolton (2004a, 2004b) and LoLordo (2008), Locke does not pay sufficient attention to occasional perceptual error. There are, however, two things to say that alleviate having to saddle Locke with the view that hallucinations count as sensitive knowledge. First, Locke thinks that the collections of ideas we experience as originating in the senses do actually exist together: In fine then, when our senses do actually convey into our Understandings any Idea, we cannot but be satisfied, that there doth something at that time really exist without us, which doth affect our Senses, and by them give notice of it self to our apprehensive Faculties, and actually produce that Idea, which we then perceive: and we cannot so far distrust their Testimony, as to doubt, that such Collections of simple Ideas, as we have observed by our Senses to be united together, do really exist together. (IV.xi.9)\n",
            "\n",
            "So, it seems that he would not countenance doubting that whatever we are experiencing through the senses corresponds to something that is or can be experienced through the senses. That is, the collections of simple sensory ideas composing our ideas of external objects are real and adequate ideas.\n",
            "\n",
            "Second, one reason why Locke might say this is that he can also be seen to think that just as there is an obvious conscious difference between ideas originating in sensation, memory, and, say, reflective mental states, there is a (perhaps even more fine-grained) difference in experience between regular sensory ideas and occasional hallucinations. For example, after having been slipped a hallucinogenic drug I may see a pink elephant (or Cartman, my black cat—the same one I interact with regularly) at the back of the room. I suggest that, for Locke, even though I am having a “visual” experience (an hallucination) of Cartman, it is not phenomenologically identical to a regular visual experience. Hallucinating is a different kind of mental act and so experienced differently. Locke is also clear that we are aware of all of our\n",

            "mental operations, even if we have only “obscure Notions” (II.i.25), and I have argued (as have others) that there are very good reasons to think that this awareness is due to consciousness. Phenomenological theories of consciousness generally attribute a particular subjective character, or a certain phenomenal quality of “what it is like” to experience different kinds of perceptual states. So occasional hallucinations can be seen as distinguishable from normal sense experience.103\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, although considered a systematic skeptical possibility, the analysis of the “unknown faculty” in Descartes’s interpretation can be seen as making a similar point. Newman (1994: 496) has argued persuasively that Descartes accepts the view that we are aware of all of our mental activity: “For any faculty, known or unknown, in me, I am aware of when its operations occur.” Therefore, were the ideas originating in such a faculty, I would be conscious of it. Since Locke is also committed to the view that all thinking is conscious (II.i.19), I see no reason why he would argue differently.\n",
            "\n",

            "### 3.III.4 The Difference in Degree of Certainty of Sensitive and Intuitive Knowledge Locke is quite clear that although sensitive knowledge is a species of knowledge, and (as I have argued) the agreement is perceived non-inferentially, still it is not as certain as intuitive knowledge: “The notice we have by our Senses, of the existing of Things without us, though it be not altogether so certain, as our intuitive Knowledge, or the Deductions of our Reason, employ’d about the clear abstract Ideas of our own Minds; yet it is an assurance that deserves the name of Knowledge” (IV.xi.3).

            "That is, I can be conscious that I am perceiving even when owing to “habitual custom” the object of my perception passes so quickly in the mind that I do not take full notice of it. Moreover, that the unity of consciousness is maintained in the mind’s movement from the idea of the flat circle to the idea of the round globe supports that we are conscious we are perceiving throughout the change in ideas.\n",
            "\n",
            "analysis sensitive and intuitive knowledge are seen to be equivalent. In both cases, when I perceive the agreement I am immediately and irresistibly certain—with no room for skeptical concern.\n",
            "\n",
            "The difference between the degrees of certainty in sensitive and intuitive knowledge, I suggest, has been masked by the fact that the analysis of knowledge presented thus far has focused on only the psychological conditions of knowledge: the perception of an agreement and the subjective force of the certainty attending any perception of agreement. In terms of meeting these conditions, both kinds of knowledge are the same and both strike us the same—we cannot but accept what we perceive when we perceive the agreement. Nevertheless, insists Locke, sensitive knowledge is less certain. As Locke says, there are “three degrees of Knowledge, viz. Intuitive, Demonstrative, and Sensitive: in each of which there are different degrees and ways of Evidence and Certainty” (IV.ii.14). Perceiving an agreement, for Locke, constitutes knowledge, and all knowledge is certain.105 But how certain the knowledge is—its degree of certainty—depends on additional factors, namely whether a further reflective normative condition is met.106 I suggest that the fact that sensitive knowledge enjoys a degree of certainty does not mean that it is beyond any doubt; neither does its vulnerability to doubt mean that it does not have a degree of certainty. I propose that, for Locke, intuitive and sensitive knowledge have different degrees of certainty, because intuitive knowledge withstands a second-order normative consideration, while sensitive knowledge does not.107 Although our sensitive knowledge is not as certain as we initially thought it was, our intuitive knowledge maintains its certainty—or at least our intuitive knowledge is as certain as we are capable of knowing.\n",
            "\n",
            "For example, if after I intuitively perceive that my idea “white” is as I perceive it to be, I were to step back and consider reflectively whether I should accept that conclusion, I would have the same experience of intuitively knowing the idea “white” again. The same is true for my intuitive knowledge that “three are more than two” or that “I exist.” I have the same certainty with every consideration whether I should accept what I know in virtue of perceiving the agreement. For every time I reflect on my perception of the agreement, I perceive the agreement again. I cannot place myself in a perceptual situation in which I am not immediately and irresistibly certain that what I perceive is true. Therefore, my intuitive knowledge has what I will call “full epistemic warrant”: it meets the psychological conditions,\n",
            "\n",
            "and in reflection I cannot generate a reason why I should not accept it. The perception of my own real existence as well as of identity and diversity or of any other intuitively perceived agreements is of the highest degree of certainty because it withstands a second-order normative challenge.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our experience of sensitive knowledge, however, is much different. When we reflect on our sensitive knowledge, our perceptual situation changes. No longer are we perceiving an occurrent idea of sensation, and thus no longer are we perceiving an agreement constituting knowledge with the subjective force of the certainty therein.\n",
            "\n",
            "With this shift in cognitive standpoint, there is also a shift in what we are aware of insofar as we perceive an agreement. What we are aware of now is not an idea as currently from sensation, but rather, perhaps, an idea as mental state. Therefore, once we step back from our initial certainty in sensitive knowledge and ask why we should accept what was just so very certain a moment ago, our own experience and observation provide a reason for doubt. After all, when we are not occurrently sensing, we can consider that we might be in a perpetual dream or, equivalently, the victims of an evil demon.108 Sensitive knowledge, therefore, lacks full epistemic warrant and so has a lesser degree of certainty.\n",
            "\n",
            "Let me take a moment now to address a couple of questions that might arise. First, I have been asked whether this analysis of sensitive knowledge stands up to Locke’s claims concerning “habitual knowledge,” namely that sensitive knowledge is retained. It does. Habitual knowledge comes in two “degrees”: of such truths where we perceive the relation between ideas again, which is a case of intuitive knowledge, and of such truths where the mind “retains the Memory of the Conviction, without the Proofs” (IV.i.9). Although Locke’s discussion of the latter form of retained knowledge is concerned almost exclusively with demonstrative knowledge, he does at the very end assert, “But yet ’tis evident, the Author himself knows the Proposition to be true, remembering he once saw the connection of those Ideas [in a proof], as certainly as he knows such a Man wounded another, remembering that he saw him run through” (IV.i.9). The objection would be that sensitive knowledge as interpreted above would not be retained in memory if it does not withstand a second-order consideration.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is not the case, however, since Locke is talking about remembering the certainty with which we perceived the agreement, not perceiving the agreement again. In a case of retained sensitive knowledge, I can remember the certainty with which I initially perceived the agreement, but, nevertheless, I can take a second-order stance to that\n",
            "\n",
            "remembered sensitive knowledge to consider whether there is any room for doubt.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then I would have to admit that it is possible that I am in a perpetual dream or deceived by an evil demon. As we have seen, that just is the difference in degree of certainty between sensitive knowledge and intuitive knowledge.\n",
            "\n",
            "Second, does my account put sensitive knowledge on a par with enthusiasm, since they meet the same psychological conditions of logical and temporal immediacy and the conviction of certainty? To see why they are not on par, think about intuitive knowledge, which is also logically and temporally immediate. Consider, for example, the intuitively known proposition “three is more than two.” It is one question whether that agreement has the highest degree of certainty. I have argued that if in reflection we cannot generate a doubt, then it does. It is an altogether different question whether God has directly revealed that truth to me or I have come to know it by way of Locke’s empiricist explanation (IV.xix.10). Locke says that the certainty of anything known by revelation is the degree of certainty we have that it actually is revelation, not the degree of certainty the perception of the agreement has on its own. Indeed, Locke is clear that “Faith can never convince us of any Thing, that contradicts our Knowledge” (IV.xviii.5). That is because our justification for faith is limited by our ability to have knowledge. So, to think that faith can outstrip knowledge is to “overturn all the Principles and Foundations of Knowledge [God] has given us; render all our Faculties useless; wholly destroy the most excellent Part of his Workmanship, our Understandings” (IV.xviii.5). Thus, if we can know something by our own faculties, it does little to the glorification of God to claim that we know it by direct revelation and not by the use of those faculties. What, then, he asks, would be the point of giving us the faculties in the first place?\n",
            "\n",
            "I suggest that a similar answer can be given with respect to why sensitive knowledge is not equivalent to enthusiasm. The first thing to say is that the psychological conditions are not the same, for perceiving the agreement in an instance of sensitive knowledge includes the experience of the knowledge as having its source in sensation.\n",
            "\n",
            "That is, even on the off chance that the source is an evil demon, I still have the experience of being affected through the senses. But again, if what I know by sensation can just as equally be claimed to be an instance of direct revelation, then why has God given us the faculty of sensation? I suggest that Locke is not so concerned with the objection, since he does not think knowledge, in any form, is over determined in this way. “It is hard,” he says, “to conceive how there can be a revelation to any one of what he knows already” (IV.xix.10). Furthermore, Locke’s main objection to enthusiasm is that it is the irrational acceptance of a belief. It is to place faith above reason: “He that believes, without having any Reason for believing, may be in love with his own Fancies; but neither seeks the Truth as he ought, nor pays the Obedience due his Maker, who would have him use those discerning Faculties he has given him, to keep him out of Mistake and Errour. . . . He that does otherwise, transgresses against his own Light, and misuses those Faculties, which were given him to no other end, but to search and follow the clearer Evidence, and greater\n",
            "\n",
            "Probability” (IV.xvii.24). Sensitive knowledge is not the same as enthusiasm, since our experience that we are sensing does indeed give us a reason (even in reflection) to think that our ideas are the result of really existing things affecting our senses, albeit not a reason that withstands all doubt. Indeed, in describing what is meant by “enthusiasm,” Locke says, “For strong conceit, like a new principle, carries all easily with it, when got above common sense, and freed from all restraint of reason and check of reflection, it is heightened into a divine authority, in concurrence with our own temper and inclination” (IV.xix.7). Thus, my interpretation has not put sensitive knowledge on par with enthusiasm.\n",
            "\n",
            "Returning now to the role of psychological and normative conditions in establishing epistemic warrant and so degrees of certainty of knowledge, we can look again to Locke’s aim in the Essay. That task is to discover the limits of human understanding, that is, to show what we are justified in asserting, given the resources we have. Thus, he sees only intuitive knowledge as meeting the highest standard for certainty. Perhaps one reason Locke does not require a more rigid standard for knowledge is that he is not willing to seek justification for any source of knowledge—including the senses— outside of what human understanding can deliver on its own. In his introduction to the nature of the investigation undertaken in the Essay, Locke contrasts his conclusions with those of the skeptic: Thus Men, extending their Enquiries beyond their Capacities, and letting their Thoughts wander into those depths, where they can find no sure Footing; ’tis no Wonder, that they raise Questions, and multiply Disputes, which never coming into any clear Resolution, are proper only to continue and increase their Doubts, and to confirm them at last in perfect Scepticism. Whereas were the Capacities of our Understandings well considered, the Extent of our Knowledge once discovered, and the Horizon found, which sets the Bounds between the enlightened and dark Parts of Things; between what is and what is not comprehensible by us, Men would perhaps with less scruple acquiesce in the avow’d ignorance of the one, and imploy their Thoughts and Discourse, with more Advantage and Satisfaction in the other. (I.i.7)\n",
            "\n",
            "If we have reached the limits of justification, then it makes better sense to say that we have knowledge with at least some degree of certainty, rather than no knowledge at all, especially if Locke’s main task was to ground moral and pragmatic concerns rather than to pursue a “Universal, or perfect Comprehension of whatsoever is.” But if Locke is willing to rest with what our perceptual faculties can deliver of the external world on their own, and even call it knowledge, then why include a slew of probabilistic arguments in defense of it? I suggest that as long as we do not reflectively challenge the psychological experience of certainty in having sensitive knowledge, the probabilistic arguments do not come into play. Once, however, we trade psychological certainty in sensitive knowledge for a new standard by asking the traditional skeptical question “whether we can thence certainly infer the existence of anything without us” (IV.ii.14, my emphasis), we find ourselves in need of additional reasons to shore up the initial deliverances of our perceptual faculty. We\n",

            "\n",
            "We see Locke making this shift from the initial certainty of sensitive knowledge to the need for further warrant when he introduces the probabilistic arguments in IV.xi.3. He begins by affirming that we cannot doubt what is present to our senses: “I think no body can, in earnest, be so skeptical, as to be uncertain of the Existence of those Things which he sees and feels” (IV.xi.3). This is a clear statement that sensitive knowledge enjoys certainty and that our sensitive knowledge can be no more certain to us when we are perceiving occurrent real and adequate ideas of sensation.\n",

For example, those arguments include pointing to our ability to be affected by the senses (IV.xi.4), the passivity of the senses (IV.xi.5), the fact that a sense experience is often accompanied by a pain, while a memory of the very same experience is not (IV.xi.6), and the fact that we have common agreement concerning our sense experiences (IV.xi.7).\n",

Thus, it makes sense to interpret Locke as seeing the difference between the degrees of certainty of knowledge as the difference in the ability to withstand a challenge of this kind. My suggestion, therefore, is that these arguments address different tasks: grounding sensitive knowledge in psychological conditions due to the nature and experience of our own thinking and seeking to ground it in a secondorder normative perspective we take to our own thinking and experience. The difference between intuitive and sensitive knowledge is not, in other words, that one is knowledge and the other really is not; it is that intuitive knowledge meets second-order normative as well as psychological conditions for certainty while sensitive knowledge meets only the psychological conditions. [Remember that necessary and sufficient for knowledge (in general) is the perception of an agreement or disagreement of ideas (with the subjective force of certainty attending any perception of agreement).] The additional epistemic condition of withstanding a reflective challenge determines the degree of certainty from a second-order normative perspective and so the differences in the degrees of certainty of knowledge. Locke’s theory of the degrees of certainty of knowledge requires that different epistemic\n",

Locke speaks of the same (although even greater) difficulty in assuming a skeptical attitude to intuitive knowledge in IV.ii.1. There Locke states that to demand a greater certainty than what we experience in intuitive knowledge “shews only that he has a Mind to be a Sceptick, without being able to be so” (my emphasis). To take the skeptic’s point of view with respect to intuitive knowledge is practically impossible.

But as soon as I turn my attention back to the things affecting my senses—to my occurrent experiences, I will once again be in a cognitive situation psychologically indistinguishable from an instance of intuitive knowledge.

Consider this passage: By which it is plain, that every step in Reasoning, that produces Knowledge, has intuitive Certainty; which when the Mind perceives, there is no more required, but to remember it to make the Agreement or Disagreement of the Ideas, concerning which we enquire, visible and certain. So that to make any thing a Demonstration, it is necessary to perceive the Agreement of the intervening Ideas, whereby the Agreement or Disagreement of the two Ideas under Examination (whereof the one is always the first, and the other the last in the Account) is found. This intuitive Perception of the Agreement or Disagreement of the intermediate Ideas, in each Step and Progression of the Demonstration, must also be carried exactly in the Mind, and a Man must be sure that no part is left out; which because in long Deductions, and the use of many Proofs, the Memory does not always so readily and exactly retain: therefore it comes to pass, that this is more imperfect than intuitive Knowledge, and Men often embrace Falshoods for Demonstrations.

Perhaps the demonstration is long, and I have left out a step in the proof.\n",

Take, for example, this passage: “I cannot be certain, that the same Man exists now, since there is no necessary connexion of his Existence a minute since, with his Existence now: by a thousand ways he may cease to be, since I had the Testimony of my Senses for his Existence” (IV.xi.9).

Thus it is with Knowledge, made out by a long train of Proofs. (IV.ii.6)\n",

Moreover, Locke is describing not only what makes demonstrative knowledge in general, or theoretically, less certain, but also what actually happens in the course of reflecting on a demonstration. When we successfully complete a proof—have demonstrative knowledge—we have that “evident lustre and full assurance,” namely the clear and distinct perception of an agreement of ideas and the subjective force of the certainty attending it. As long as we can perceive the agreement, the luster and full assurance remain. But on reflection, when I think about the proof again, I have actually forgotten a step, so I no longer have that luster and full assurance constitutive of an instance of knowledge. I have lost the clarity and distinctness; I can no longer “see” all the steps in the proof. And since I am no longer perceiving an agreement of ideas, the “full assurance” (or subjective certainty) attending the perception of agreement disappears. As time goes by, I remember fewer and fewer steps in the proof, until I am left with a very “dim” reconstruction of it.\n",

An idea is “distinct,” for Locke, when it is “sufficiently distinguishable from another” (II.xxix.5).\n",

            "agreement of ideas. Furthermore, it is consistent with Locke’s account of retained (or “habitual”) demonstrative knowledge, for that does not require that we are able to reconstruct the proof. Rather, we need only remember the certainty with which we once perceived the agreement and that there is an “immutability of the same relations between the same immutable things” (IV.i.9). In sum, then, the passage above from IV.ii.6 presents no problem for my interpretation.\n",

            "If I can be permitted a brief digression, Descartes too, in the Rules for the Direction of the Mind, considered demonstrative knowledge as more vulnerable to mistake because of its reliance on memory. In “Rule Eleven,” Descartes distinguishes between a deduction that “involves a kind of movement of our mind” and one that “no longer signifies a movement but rather the completion of a movement”: That is why we are supposing that deduction is made through intuition when it is simple and transparent, but not when it is complex and involved. When the latter is the case, we call it “enumeration” or “induction”, since the intellect cannot simultaneously grasp it as a whole, and its certainty in a sense depends on memory, which must retain the judgments we have made on the individual parts of the enumeration if we are to derive a single conclusion from them taken as a whole. (CSM I: 37; AT X: 408)\n",
            "\n",
            "Descartes adds only a few lines later: As we have said, conclusions which embrace more than we can grasp in a single intuition depend for their certainty on memory, and since memory is weak and unstable, it must be refreshed and strengthened through this continued and repeated movement of thought. Say, for instance in virtue of several operations, I have discovered the relation between the first and the second magnitude of a series, then the relation between the second and the third and the fourth, and lastly the fourth and the fifth: that does not necessarily enable me to see what the relation is between the first and the fifth, and I cannot deduce it from the relations I already know unless I remember all of them. That is why it is necessary that I run over them again and again in my mind until I can pass from the first to the last so quickly that memory is left with practically no role to play, and I seem to be intuiting the whole thing at once.

            "Descartes’s point here, not unlike Locke’s, is that although deduction itself is a mental faculty that leads to certainty, the less of a role memory has to play in constructing the proof, namely the more able we are to perceive the whole proof at once, the greater is our justification for certainty. Similarly, according to Locke, in long and complex proofs there is always the chance that I have forgotten a step, and so even if the original ideas actually agree, I have not perceived them to agree. And it is the perception of the agreement (the justification) that qualifies it as knowledge—not merely the agreement (the truth) itself.\n",

            "One might also object that on this analysis of Locke there is no reason why demonstrative knowledge should be more certain than sensitive knowledge: In both cases, upon reflection, we can generate a reason to doubt what we cannot but accept when we perceive the agreement. All three degrees of knowledge have the same\n",

            "psychological certainty when the agreement is perceived. So, what is the difference in normative warrant between demonstrative and sensitive knowledge such that the former has a higher degree of certainty than the latter? Although Locke does not directly address this objection, he could easily have said something like this: When I incur doubt with respect to my sensitive knowledge it is due to a wholesale failure with respect to my ability to distinguish the causes of my ideas. That is, I can experience my ideas as originating in the senses and yet be entirely mistaken about their causes. I realize on reflection that I am incapable of knowing whether my psychological experience is the result of external objects or whether it is actually the result of an evil demon or of electrodes attached to my brain. Therefore, the doubt I experience when I reflect upon my sensitive knowledge can never be inferentially satisfied. But this does not mean that Locke has not secured any knowledge gained through the senses. Indeed, were all our knowledge of external objects secured by inference, we would not be able to isolate the reflective doubt of the epistemologist from the impossibility of that doubt when having the psychological experience of being presently affected through the senses.\n",
            "\n",
            "There is some demonstrative knowledge, however, for which I cannot generate a doubt, because the proofs are simple and the intervening ideas are never forgotten. For example, perhaps someone has taught the Essay enough times that she will never forget the intervening idea in knowing demonstratively that “the angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles.” When she steps back to reflect on that knowledge, she cannot generate a doubt. Because some demonstrative knowledge (but of course not all) resists reflective doubt, I do not reach a point at which I can raise a wholesale doubt as to the normative status of my cognitive position. This is just to say that because Locke limits his investigation to what we can discover by means of experience and observation, it is never appropriate to entertain the “metaphysical doubt” of the Cartesian skeptic.\n",

But yet where the Mind clearly retains the Intuition it had of the Agreement it had of any Idea with another, and that with a third, and that with a fourth, etc. there the Agreement of the first and the fourth is a Demonstration, and produces certain Knowledge, which may be called Rational Knowledge, as the other is Intuitive.”\n",

And it is in the experience of our own minds that we come up against the dissonance between what we believe with the utmost confidence and what upon a second-order consideration actually warrants that confidence. In the last chapter on knowledge, before turning to judgment and probability, Locke makes the following observations. First, Our Knowledge, as in other Things, so in this, has a great Conformity with our Sight, that it is neither wholly necessary, nor wholly voluntary. . . . Men that have Senses, cannot chuse but receive some Ideas by them; and if they have Memory, they cannot but retain some of them; and if they have any distinguishing Faculty, cannot but perceive the Agreement, or Disagreement of some of them one with another.

            "\n",
            "I take Locke’s point to be that we cannot but have some knowledge due to the nature of our mental faculties. We cannot avoid the certainty that comes with perceiving agreements of ideas. But we are not limited to what the mind presents to us as psychologically unavoidable. Rather, we have the ability to step back and willfully take a survey of what we perceive in order “to observe accurately all that is visible in it.” Here Locke is acknowledging both the unavoidability of our knowledge and what more is revealed about our knowledge when we consider it from a higher order perspective.\n",

            "### 3.III.5 Conclusion This concludes my discussion of Locke’s theory of knowledge and the role consciousness plays in it. I have focused on how we have knowledge of our own ideas, knowledge of ourselves, and knowledge of things external to us, because along with Locke I see these forms of knowledge as “peculiar” or, at least, not as clearly cases of the perception of an agreement of ideas—even though they are. They are cases of knowing particular truths that do not fit squarely under the definition of knowledge as a agreement of ideas in the sense in which we normally think of such agreements as employing general or abstract ideas, and leading to general knowledge. Moreover, although all perceptions of ideas are complex mental states with constituent elements (an idea perceived, an idea of existence, and consciousness), the agreements in these three forms of knowledge depend on just\n",
            "\n",
            "these three constituents and what is implied in having them as a part of the perception of an idea. Realizing the complexity internal to perceptions of ideas allows us not only to make sense of, but also provide a coherent and structurally similar account of, all that Locke says about our intuitive knowledge of our own ideas and ourselves as well as about sensitive knowledge.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is now time to move on to the role of consciousness in Locke’s theory of personal identity. Here, too, we will see how consciousness as internal to a complex perceptual state allows Locke to establish a revolutionary theory of the diachronic identity of persons that is also sufficient for his moral and theological concerns. Furthermore, my interpretation can accommodate Locke’s commitments to the possibility of false memory and his apparent switching back and forth from a purely psychological account of consciousness as a state of awareness of ourselves to an account that seems also to include a metaphysical aspect to consciousness—as an ongoing self we are aware of in that mental state. What is more, the account avoids problems of circularity and transitivity at no cost.\n",
            "\n",
            "No doubt, here, Locke is responding to the Cartesian claim that the essence of the soul is to think, and so the soul must be always thinking: “I know it an Opinion,” Locke says, “that the Soul always thinks, and that it has the actual Perception of Ideas in it self constantly, as long as it exists; and that actual thinking is as inseparable from the Soul, as actual Extension is from the Body” (II.i.9). But then Locke, employing his method of taking an introspective look at our own thinking, counters the Cartesian view by admitting that there is nothing in our experience to back up this claim, and indeed dreamless sleep seems to justify the opposite.1 A better view perhaps, and more warranted by what we actually experience, according to Locke, is that thinking is not the essence of the soul but a power or activity of the soul.2 Even Locke’s concern with memory in these initial passages is in the service of establishing the plausibility (and the better hypothesis) that the soul has periods in which it does not think. Against the view that we might be always thinking and yet not remember it, Locke argues that that would be a very useless sort of thinking indeed. And it is highly implausible to imagine that memory regularly fails for all those hours in the night during which we are sleeping.3 In these arguments, we can see Locke as employing\n",
            "\n",
            "their shared acceptance of the “mental transparency thesis,” that all thinking is conscious, in order to combat one of Descartes’s most famous doctrines: his commitment to the essence of the soul as thinking and the emphasis on the nature of an immaterial substance as the necessary ground for our experience of ourselves as having continued psychological activity.\n",
            "\n",
            "We see this in how Locke extends his analysis. In addition, he argues, maintaining that the soul always thinks, in combination with the facts of experience, leads to a number of implausible consequences. And here we start to see the beginning of Locke’s understanding of the role of consciousness in his thoughts on personal identity. For example, if the soul were always thinking, and I am conscious of all of my thinking, then my soul must be going elsewhere when I am sleeping. It is even possible that I share a soul with someone else: it inhabits my body when I am awake and so I am conscious of my thinking, but when I fall asleep, my soul must move on to continue thinking in another body. But then the crucial question is what constitutes the I, self, or person that is me when my soul (and its thinking) inhabits another body. Locke asks “Whether Castor and Pollux, thus, with only one Soul between them, which thinks and perceives in one, what the other is never conscious of, nor is concerned for, are not two distinct Persons, as Castor and Hercules; or as Socrates and Plato were?” (II.i.12). Notice here Locke’s dialectical move from Descartes’s (or anyone’s) reliance on the soul and its continued thinking to an appeal to consciousness for help in distinguishing different persons.\n",
            "\n",
            "Even more interestingly, Locke emphasizes not just an awareness of any of our thoughts as ours, but more specifically the consciousness of pleasure and pain and its link to a concern for happiness as crucial to identifying a person: “For if we take wholly away all Consciousness of our Actions and Sensations especially of Pleasure and Pain, and the concernment that accompanies it, it will be hard to know wherein to place personal Identity” (II.i.11). Locke seems to be concluding that our awareness of our own pleasure and pain, which engenders a concern for ourselves insofar as we have experiences of that kind, is tied to consciousness and plays a role in personal identity. I think we can see Locke’s initial concerns with personal identity as not only pointing to the fallout of holding the view that thinking is the essence of the soul, but also considering what would constitute the diachronic identity of a person if not the continued existence of a soul.\n",
            "\n",
            "Not until Locke added the II.xxvii chapter On Identity and Diversity to the second edition of the Essay, after the urging of William Molyneux, do we see a full account of issues of individuation and diachronic identity of different kinds of things, including persons, and the role of consciousness in establishing the latter.4 What was previously (in the first edition) only a very cursory mention of consciousness and its link to personal identity is now (in the second edition) turned into a full-blown theory of personal identity in which consciousness, rather than substance (either corporeal or thinking), constitutes the criterion for the identity of persons. Indeed, Locke’s theory\n",
            "\n",
            "of personal identity, as we find it in II.xxvii of the second edition of the Essay, was philosophically groundbreaking for its attempt to establish a non-substantial identity condition, namely consciousness.5 Locke states, “For the same consciousness being preserv’d, whether in the same or different Substances, the personal Identity is preserv’d” (II.xxvii.13). There are two good reasons why Locke would want a theory of this kind, aside from the fact that the continuity of a thinking (or material) substance is empirically suspect. First, relying on a psychological rather than a substantial condition allows Locke to remain agnostic on the nature of thinking substance: whether or not it must be immaterial. Indeed, having a non-substantial identity condition is consistent with Locke’s claims to know very little at all about the nature of substance. Second, at least by Locke’s lights, the theory is compatible with his theological concerns. A psychological condition allows for some flexibility with regard to the theoretical particularities involved in Locke’s theological commitments to the immortality of the soul and the resurrection of the body.6 Moreover, both of these reasons are consistent with Locke’s overall task in the Essay of outlining the limits of human understanding. What is more, we can see an emphasis on a psychological condition as better in tune with his anti-essentialism and his moral theory, including his view that having certain psychological abilities (including intellectual abilities) is necessary to moral agency, rather than being a particular kind of substance.\n",

For whatever any Substance has thought or done, which I cannot recollect, and by my consciousness make my own Thought and Action, it will no more belong to me, whether a part of me thought or did it, than if it had been thought or done by any other immaterial being any where existing.

As early as John Sergeant and Joseph Butler, Locke’s theory was accused of circularity, since knowing that one is identical to a past self, namely having a veridical memory of a past thought or action, presupposes that the criterion has already been met; there is already an identical self to know.10\n",

            "One way to address this problem, while still seeing personal identity as dependent on the attribution of past thoughts and actions to a self, is to see consciousness as not strictly identical to memory. As Mackie (1976: 178) first stated, rather, consciousness consists in the awareness of one’s thoughts and actions from the “inside.” So, in addition to any memories that are there, consciousness would include whatever I can attribute to myself in any moment—whatever I experience as mine. Thiel (2011: 210) puts it this way: “to Locke, whatever it is that I ascribe to myself through consciousness or memory is part of my personality, if not part of my self as a man or soul. Locke’s theory of personality could be vulnerable to the charge of circularity only if the distinction between person, man, and soul is rejected.” Such views have often been called “appropriation theories” of personal identity. Passages in Locke thought key to supporting this interpretation include Locke’s use of the terms ‘appropriation,’ ‘selfattribution,’ or the ‘imputing’ of actions to oneself. Kenneth Winkler (1998: 154), the first to set forth what has been a highly influential interpretation of this stripe, considers the following to be the most “powerful evidence” supporting the proposal: Person, as I take it, is the name for this self. Where-ever a man finds, what he calls himself, there I think another may say is the same Person. . . . This personality extends it self beyond present Existence to what is past, only by consciousness, whereby it becomes concerned and\n",

            "accountable, owns and imputes to it self past Actions, just upon the same ground, and for the same reason, that it does the present. . . . And therefore whatever past Actions it cannot reconcile or appropriate to that present self by consciousness, it can no more be concerned in, than if they had never been done. (II.xxvii.26)\n",
            "\n",
            "The focus is on the way in which the appropriation or self-imputation of thoughts and actions constitutes the extension of “personality” through time. Winkler (1998: 154) interprets Locke as saying that the self has a “certain authority over its own constitution,” so that whatever I take myself to include is what my consciousness “reveals to me” as mine in any particular moment. We want to be clear, though, that the appropriation should not be considered as voluntary or arbitrary. We cannot pick and choose which thoughts and actions to impute to ourselves.\n",
            "\n",
            "Nevertheless, the mere fact that we all experience gaps in memory, namely gaps in the consciousness of our past actions, during which time we would not be the same person, lends a distinct impracticability to the theory, especially since personal identity is essential to Locke’s theory of moral responsibility and divine rectification. Divine rectification is the theological doctrine that we will be judged and then rewarded or punished by God in the next life for what we have done in this life. Such reward and punishment is just only if on the day of judgment the one standing before God is the same person who committed the past act. But if the sole criterion for diachronic identity is a person’s own consciousness of past and present mental states, namely what is revealed to oneself in a conscious act of appropriation, then personal identity seems ill equipped to determine just punishment. After all, we are not presently aware of all we have done.11 So, as long as the identity of the self is determined from a subjective point of view, rectification is impossible, for there is nothing objective, say, an enduring substance, for God to appeal to in determining whether or not we should be punished.\n",
            "\n",
            "Leibniz (1996: 236), though sympathetic to the claim that consciousness is a necessary condition for personal identity, argued, in response to Locke in the New Essays, that it was not enough. Leibniz insisted on the necessity of a substantial “real identity” underlying the phenomenal states we subjectively experience.12\n",
            "\n",
            "Winkler (1998) suggests that Locke might think that personal identity consists in something that underlies consciousness as a state of awareness, which drives a wedge between the real self and the self I take myself to be. . . .

            "past Actions can be transferr’d from one thinking Substance to another” (E II.xxvii.13: 337), a claim that would be extremely odd if Locke thought that consciousness was something whose nature was transparent, and without a foundation that might be better known by God than by ourselves. The rest of }13 strongly suggests that consciousness is not transparent—that it has (though this may be misleading) an unknown real essence. (Winkler 1998: 170–1)\n",
            "\n",
            "Rather than abandon the appropriation theory, the insufficiency with divine rectification leads Winkler (1998: 164–5) to go beyond Locke, yet remain in his words “Lockean” by appealing to substance (“time slices”) to make sure that God has something to look to in determining punishment: “Suppose we allow that substancestages—temporal slices of the enduring things Locke has in mind when he speaks of substances—can be the subjects of thoughts, feelings, and actions of earlier ones, giving rise to relations of psychological continuity.” But surely Locke himself would not make such an appeal to substance to ground the identity of persons.\n",

            "LoLordo (2012: 73) addresses the problem (what in note 11 above she referred to as the “underlying intuition [that] needs addressing”) by arguing that “certain real psychological relations ground what can and cannot be appropriated. You can only appropriate those past experiences that are available to you, and which past experiences are available to you depends on facts about what you remember.” Moreover, her view, she argues, does not collapse back into a memory theory, since there is “a causal connection between memories and the sense experiences they present to us again.” Following Garrett (2003: 110ff), Locke’s account of memory includes a way of distinguishing a false from a genuine memory. LoLordo (2012: 73–4) explains it this way: Memory, for Locke, is not a matter of representing past ideas but of having those very same ideas again. The difference between eating an oyster and remembering the meal later is not that they involve different ideas: when you eat the oyster, you experience a certain group of ideas as ideas of sensation, and when you later remember the meal, you experience the same ideas as ideas of memory. . . . Thus, to remember a past action, your current memory experience must be caused by some past sensory experience of that action.\n",

            "Using Garrett’s insight, LoLordo can ensure a causal connection between an original sense experience and a later appropriation of it. I think Garrett is right about memory, and I will make use of his view later in this chapter. For LoLordo to employ it, however, comes at too high a price. First, LoLordo’s view requires her to deny that consciousness transference, as Locke describes it in II.xxvii.13, results in false memory. Indeed, on LoLordo’s account there is no possibility of false memory. Although others have made the same move, it conflicts with what Locke actually says in II.xxvii.13, when he specifically considers the possibility of false memory.13\n",

            "Second, there are several passages (II.x.5, II.x.10, II.i.15, IV.iv.2) in which Locke seems to say that the causal traces LoLordo relies on to guarantee the connection\n",

            "between a past action (in memory) and a present appropriation of it are stored in the body.14 It follows that she would have to attribute to Locke the view that a consciousness must be resurrected with the same body. But Locke (Works 4: 304) clearly denies any commitment of that sort. LoLordo (2012: 94, n 56) acknowledges that Locke is not committed to the resurrection of the same body, but she does not consider those passages in which Locke attributes the causal traces in memory to the body. This is not to say that I do not agree with much of LoLordo’s view, for I do. But if, as I argue, we interpret Locke to include a metaphysical fact of consciousness, then we address the circularity threat as well as accommodate Locke’s commitment to divine rectification. And we do so without incurring either cost.\n",

            "Another well-known problem facing Locke’s theory of personal identity, pointed to by both Reid and Berkeley, is its apparent failure to adhere to logical transitivity.15\n",
            "\n",
            "Reid’s explanation of the difficulty is most famous, so I will reiterate that one here: Suppose a brave officer to have been flogged when a boy at school, for robbing an orchard, to have taken a standard from the enemy in his first campaign, and to have been made a general in advanced life: Suppose also, which must be admitted to be possible, that when he took the standard, he was conscious of his having been flogged at school, and that when made a general he was conscious of his taking the standard, but had absolutely lost the consciousness of his flogging.\n",
            "\n",
            "These things being supposed, it follows, from Mr. Locke’s doctrine, that he who was flogged at school is the same person who took the standard, and that he who took the standard is the same person who was made a general. Whence it follows, if there be any truth in logic, that the general is the same person with him who was flogged at school. But the general’s consciousness does not reach so far back as his flogging, therefore, according to Mr. Locke’s doctrine, he is not the same person who was flogged. Therefore, the general is, and at the same time is not the same with him who was flogged at school. (Reid 2002: 276) Many have tried to solve this problem for Locke, some by arguing that Locke does not mean to accept transitivity, others by arguing that his theory is consistent with it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Thiel (2011: 213–20) argues quite persuasively that no effort so far succeeds—or if it succeeds, then it does so by attributing to Locke a theory that he does not really hold.\n",
            "\n",
            "I will rehearse all of Thiel’s arguments here. But since I think Locke’s theory, interpreted correctly, does not fail transitivity, I will mention only a few other interpretations that attempt, but ultimately fail, to show consistency.\n",
            "\n",
            "For example, Mackie (1976: 179) and Jolley (1999: 121) argue that weakening the transitivity relation solves the problem. We can replace actually remembering a past self with potentially remembering a past self. So, the general need only be able to\n",

            "remember the flogged boy in principle, not actually. But, as Thiel (2011: 216) responds, such a view invites circularity, for being able to remember in principle is no different from relying on a previously established identity of the person—being able to have a veridical memory implies that I am the same self to remember.\n",
            "\n",
            "A different way of weakening transitivity, attempted by Noonan (1989: 10) and Winkler (1998: 156) is to replace an actual memory relation between a present and a past person with what is often called an “ancestral memory” relation. That is, continuity between persons can be forged by memory links to various ancestor selves that remember the particular past self that a present self cannot remember. So, we have a continuity of consciousness without a complete continuity of memory. Even though Locke does not equate consciousness with memory, still this solution will not do. It is not sufficient for Locke’s understanding of moral responsibility and the role personal identity plays in it. Locke seems to think that I must be able to remember a specific past action in order to be held responsible for it: “For whatsoever any Substance has thought or done, which I cannot recollect, and by my consciousness make my own Thought or Action, it will no more belong to me, whether a part of me thought or did it, than if it had been thought or done by any other immaterial Being any where existing” (II.xxvii.24). This criticism can be extended to Winkler’s (1998: 156), Garrett’s (2003: 103), and LoLordo’s (2012: 70n16) attempts to address the transitivity problem by arguing that in consciously appropriating any thought or action of a past self I automatically appropriate all the thoughts and actions of that self. For the same reasons, we can see why this does not work: attribution of moral responsibility seems to require that one actually remember the specific past action.16\n",

            "Finally, Yaffe’s (2007: 228) unique “susceptibility to punishment theory” argues that Locke reverses the “assumed order of priority of the metaphysical and the moral.” Facts about just punishment and reward ground the identity of a person, rather than the other way around, which avoids circularity for Locke. I note several objections to Yaffe’s interpretation later in the chapter. But even if we allow that he solves circularity, the interpretation does not seem to maintain transitivity. According to Yaffe, I am the same person as another if we are both punishable for the same action. But, unfortunately, because the relation of just punishment is not transitive, neither is the personal identity relation.17\n",

And although Winkler, Garrett, Thiel, and LoLordo solve circularity by having the appropriation of thoughts and actions constitute the continuity of consciousness, where as Yaffe solves it by grounding the metaphysical\n",

To be clear, however, even though Locke’s contribution to contemporary accounts of personal identity is substantial, I am not also arguing that once Locke is rescued from incoherence, we should find his theory of personal identity as it stands on its own a convincing one.\n",
            "\n",
            "The clue to my interpretation is that Locke’s conception of consciousness involves an ambiguity. In the II.xxvii. chapter devoted to personal identity, Locke seems to see consciousness as (1) a mental state inseparable from an act of perception by means of which we are aware of ourselves as perceiving, and (2) the ongoing self we are aware of in these conscious states.20 The first sense of consciousness, the one employed in his philosophical psychology and in his theory of knowledge, is a momentary psychological state. It is the one that provokes the objections already mentioned. This sense of consciousness allows for a momentary subjective experience that the self presently perceiving is the same as the self that remembers having once had a past thought or action. ‘Subjective,’ here, is meant to describe something psychological, which is epistemically available only from a first-personal point of view. The second sense of consciousness, which is needed to answer the objections, is the objective fact of an ongoing consciousness. ‘Objective’ is meant to describe something that is epistemically available from a third-personal (maybe only God’s) point of view. The ongoing self that I am aware of in being conscious of past and present thoughts and actions seems also to have an objective continued temporal existence through any gaps in my successive, subjective states of awareness of myself.21 Disambiguating these two senses of consciousness allows for a metaphysical fact, what I am also calling an ‘objective fact,’ of my diachronic existence. Thus, there is no problem of circularity or transitivity, and there is a metaphysical ground for Locke’s theory of divine rectification. God need only look to all that I, as a continuously existing consciousness, have done to determine my just punishment and reward.\n",

I will then, in section 4.3, begin with a very brief explanation of how the metaphysical fact is revealed to us as a phenomenological fact.22 Given the right perceptual situation, we will experience ourselves as temporally extended. Finally, consistent with my interpretation of Locke’s theory of knowledge, I will argue that what we can claim to actually know of our own diachronic identity is tempered by whether or not both the psychological and the normative conditions for knowledge are met.\n",

            "## 4.1 The Metaphysical Fact of a Continuing Consciousness The problems of circularity, transitivity, or of providing enough by way of consciousness to satisfy the demands of divine rectification, without having to pay undue costs, seem insurmountable as long as consciousness is interpreted to be merely a momentary psychological state of awareness. There are passages in II.xxvii, however, suggesting that consciousness (what we normally think of as the experience of the I, self, or person) is something that persists through our momentary conscious states of ourselves.23 For example, Locke sometimes speaks of consciousness not only as a distinct thing, but also as something that continues through time. He talks about there being “two distinct incommunicable consciousnesses” alternating by day and night (II.xxvii.23), “the same consciousness being transferr’d from one thinking Substance to another” (II.xxvii.13), “the same consciousness being continued in a succession of several Substances” (II.xxvii.10), and in several places, the “same consciousness extended” (II.xxvii.9, 10, 16), “reaching” (II.xxvii.9, 17), and “continued” (II.xxvii.25) into the past or future.\n",

            "\n",
            "There are two ways, Locke suggests, that we can think about consciousness as having a continuing existence. We can try to explain it insofar as it can be seen to fit with the traditional ontology of substances, modes, and relations or we can try to explain it insofar as it continues to exist as the objective I, self, or person we experience when we are conscious we are perceiving ideas. As for explanation by virtue of the traditional ontology, Locke tells us in II.xxvii.25 that were we to consider consciousness in this way, “the more probable Opinion is, that this consciousness is annexed to, and the Affection of, one individual immaterial Substance.” Insofar as consciousness could be made to fit into the traditional ontological scheme, Locke’s best guess is that it would be considered a mode of a single individual thinking substance. This view would be characteristic of Locke’s time.25 But this is not the kind of metaphysical explanation Locke is interested in, for in the next sentence he says, “But let Men according to their divers Hypotheses resolve of that as they please” (II.xxvii.25). Since we cannot know the real constitutions of things or the particularities involved in the relations between substances and their modes, Locke means to leave that kind of explanation up to the conjectures of others.\n",

And thus, by this consciousness, he finds himself to be the same self which did such or such an Action some Years since, by which he comes to be happy or miserable now. In all which account of the same self, the same numerical Substance is not considered, as making the same self: But the same continued consciousness, in which several Substances may have been united, and again separated from it, which whilst they continued in a vital union with that, wherein this consciousness then resided, made a part of that same self.

            "Locke acknowledges the continued existence of consciousness by telling us that it has a “duration,” which we know from his discussion of time as a technical term standing for the “distance between . . . the appearance of any two Ideas in our Minds” (II.xiv.3). According to Locke, the duration designated by a single perception of an idea is an “instant.” He says, “Such a part of Duration as this, wherein we perceive no Succession, is that which we may call an Instant; and is that which takes up the time of only one Idea in our Minds, without the Succession of another, wherein therefore we perceive no Succession at all” (II.xiv.10). Furthermore, Locke asserts that ‘duration’ is a synonym for ‘continued existence’: “we call the Existence, or the Continuation of the Existence of our selves, or anything else, Commensurate to the succession of any Ideas in our Minds, the Duration of our selves, or any such other thing co-existing with our Thinking” (II.xiv.3). And even though we can have only a momentary idea of our own duration or of the duration of any other thing, Locke seems to be saying that things endure through our successive perceptions of ideas of them. We get an idea of the length of that duration by using the ideas we have as marks for measurement. As Locke says, “Duration in it self is to be considered, as going on in one constant, equal, uniform Course: but none of the measures of it, which we make use of, can be known to do so” (II.xiv.21). Furthermore, God can know the continued existence of things as they persist through those ideas by which we measure them. Locke tells us that “God’s infinite Duration being accompanied with infinite Knowledge, and infinite Power, he sees all things past and to come; and they are no more distant from his Knowledge, no farther removed from his sight, than the\n",
            "\n",

            "Also clear from II.xxvii.25 is that Locke understands consciousness as something that has “a continued duration more than one instant.” This confirms that Locke thinks consciousness has an ongoing existence through each instant in which we are conscious of ourselves as perceiving ideas. So, duration is the ongoing temporal existence of any thing as measured by a single perception of an idea, as measured between two immediately successive ideas, or even as measured between any gaps in my awareness of myself as thinking—say between the last idea I had prior to falling into a dreamless sleep and the first idea I had upon waking. And even though there are gaps in my awareness of my own continued existence, the full extent of my duration is known by God. Therefore, in II.xxvii.25 we are told, first, that consciousness is something that endures through each momentary instance of a conscious state of awareness of itself, and second, the way in which it endures is not to be explained by appeal to the traditional underlying metaphysics of substances and their modes.\n",

            "More textual support that consciousness is something that endures through my momentary conscious states of myself is found in II.xxvii.10: For as far as any intelligent Being can repeat the Idea of any past Action with the same consciousness it had of it at first, and with the same consciousness it has of any present Action; so far is it the same personal Self. For it is by the consciousness it has of its present Thoughts and Actions that it is self to it self now, and so will be the same self as far as the same consciousness can extend to Actions past or to come; and would be by distance of Time, or change of Substance, no more two Persons than a Man be two Men, by wearing other Cloathes to Day than he did Yesterday.

Furthermore, it is the ongoing consciousness that “unites” successive perceptions of ideas: “yet ’tis plain consciousness,” Locke says, “as far as ever it can be extended, should it be to Ages past, unites Existences, and Actions, very remote in time, into the same person, as well as it does the Existence and the Actions of the immediately preceding moment” (II.xxvii.16). Whether the perception of an idea was in the distant past or whether it immediately precedes the present one, Locke seems to be saying that the same ongoing consciousness persists through and links together those momentary successive “Existences and Actions.” We see the same sort of thinking when Locke links consciousness to accountability and concern: This personality extends it self beyond present Existence to what is past, only by consciousness, whereby it becomes concerned and accountable, owns and imputes to it self past Actions, just\n",

To repeat a passage cited earlier, he says, “For if we take wholly away all Consciousness of our Actions and Sensations, especially of Pleasure and Pain, and the Concernment that accompanies it, it will be hard to know wherein to place personal Identity” (II.i.11). So, just as the consciousness of a present reflection on a past action is an experience of an ongoing self that is presently accountable for its own past, the consciousness of a present reflective consideration of a future action is an experience of an ongoing self presently concerned for its future. Unless consciousness actually is the same continuing thing, there is nothing to consider accountable now for what might have been done in the past and nothing to consider as moving toward the future to be concerned for.26 Therefore, Locke must be thinking that our accountability for the past and concern for the pleasures and pains we anticipate perceiving depends on the continued existence of the self we experience when we are conscious we are perceiving ideas.27 How, though, should we understand the metaphysics of a continuing consciousness without appealing to substance?\n",

A particular living thing, say, a plant, animal, or human being, is individuated when its life begins to exist, and it continues to exist as the same animal as long as its life continues.29 Now Locke is clear in II.xxvii.10 that he intends his analysis of the individuation and identity of animals to be in some way analogous to the individuation and identity of persons:\n",

            "\n",
            "Furthermore, the continued existence of consciousness cannot be merely the awareness of past thoughts and actions. Locke defines a person as “a thinking intelligent Being, that has reason and reflection, and can consider it self as it self, the same thinking thing in different times and places, which it does only by that consciousness” (II.xxvii.9). Since thinking is a succession of momentary ideas, each individual perception of an idea has no continued existence of its own.31 Thus, the only way a person can be the same from thought to thought is if consciousness has a continued existence from thought to thought. To employ the model of consciousness and its relation to perception from chapter two, the analogy would be that just as consciousness as a state of awareness of myself is a constituent of an act of thinking, yet something psychologically different from an act of thinking, consciousness as the ongoing self bears some sort of relation to the train of successive perceptions of ideas, yet is something metaphysically different from them. To use Locke’s words, just as the “Identity of the same Man consists . . . in nothing but a participation of the same continued Life, by constantly fleeting Particles of Matter, in a succession vitally united to the same organized Body” (II.xxvii.6, my emphasis in bold), the identity of the same person consists in nothing but a participation of the same continued consciousness, by constantly fleeting perceptions of ideas. Although the analogy is not strict in that Locke seems to think that life just is the organized particles of matter, while consciousness is something more than organized perceptions of ideas,32 the\n",

            "\n",
            "The problem is that we still do not know anything about the metaphysics of a continuing consciousness. Notice, though, that neither (for Locke) do we know anything about the metaphysics of a continuing life. All we know is that plants, animals, and human beings continue living as the same things, despite their constant change of substance. Locke explains that in plants “there is an Organization of those parts, as is fit to receive, and distribute nourishment,” such that it continues as that plant. The organization “is that individual Life, which existing constantly from that moment both forwards and backwards in the same continuity of insensibly succeeding Parts” (II.xxvii.4). In the next two sections, Locke confirms that “The Case is not so much different in Brutes” (II.xxvii.5) or in human beings (II.xxvii.6). The important point is that we do not need a full account of the “life” of an animal in order to know that it has (there is) one and that it is something distinct from the fleeting particles of matter.\n",

            "Indeed, Locke thinks a full account of what life consists in is beyond our understanding: “We see Animals are generated, nourished, and move. . . . These and like Effects we see and know: but the causes that operate, and the manner they are produced in, we can only guess, and probably conjecture” (IV.xvi.12). I suggest that when Locke tells us that the continued existence of consciousness is analogous to the life of animals, he is saying just this sort of thing. We do not need a full account of consciousness in order to know that we have (there is) one and that it is distinct from our fleeting perceptions of ideas.\n",

Winkler (1998: 165ff) argues to a different purpose that Locke does not confine himself to traditional ontological categories, but rather sees them as “worthy of philosophical investigation in their own right.” Locke felt a greater allegiance “to certain features of the lived or commonsense world” than to traditional categories and philosophical problems. Indeed, Locke’s interlocutors desiring more explanation of how ideas—something else not neatly categorized—fit the substance/mode ontology were met with responses like the following: Supposing ideas real spiritual things ever so much, if they are neither substances nor modes, let them be what they will, I am no more instructed in their nature, than when I am told they are perceptions, such as I find them.

            "There are several interpretations of what Locke could mean by God’s “superaddition” of thought to matter, especially given his IV.x. argument for the existence of God in which he seems to maintain that thinking cannot be material. To provide an explanation that reconciles these apparently contradictory claims it is important to see what the superaddition of thinking to matter could amount to in that it must be more than just the way in which particles of matter are in motion. Lisa Downing (2007: 365–9) characterizes one group of interpretations as advocating an “extrinsic powers” reading of superaddition, which can be seen as either the arbitrary attaching\n",
            "\n",
            "(or “gluing”) of thinking powers onto bodies35 or the attaching to bodies thinking powers that are governed by divinely established laws of nature.36 On the other hand, we can see superaddition as involving the way in which God has created the real constitutions of things such that they give rise either mechanically37 or nonmechanically to thought. Since it would take us too far afield to go into each of these views, let us focus only on Downing’s account, since I think it gives us more to work with insofar as consciousness is concerned, and it is a plausible reconciliation of superaddition and Locke’s proof for the existence of God.\n",
            "\n",
            "Downing (2007: 378) argues for what she calls “essentialist superaddition.” First, we should see Locke as not committed to the truth of corpuscularianism, but to a “much more abstract metaphysics of real constitution and primary quality. His ontology of mind reveals these same commitments, together with the same official agnosticism about what the real constitution of bodies and minds are actually like.” It would, however, include a commitment to essentialism38 with respect to the real constitutions of things, but not with respect to what we experience of those things from our perspective (the nominal essence) or those sorted constitutions (real essences) corresponding to the nominal essences.39 Superaddition, then, although it might look to be the addition of extrinsic (thinking) properties to matter, is only so from our point of view.\n",
            "\n",
            "That is, thinking properties do not follow from our idea of body (the nominal essence), but that does not mean that there might not be a configuration of the underlying real constitutions that has thinking as an intrinsic property. Downing (2007: 372) proposes two ways of understanding the real constitutions, such that they can give rise to thinking. It could be that “God gives some stuff a nonmechanical real constitution that allows it to manifest thought as well as extension and solidity, while he gives nonthinking material stuff a different type of real constitution, which might well be purely mechanical.” The other way to see it is that there could be “uniform nonmechanical real constitutions differently configured: the real constitutions of all material things (things that satisfy the nominal essence of matter) are nonmechanical; God configures some of them so as to allow them to think.”40 Note that this explanation entails that mechanism is at best an incomplete explanation of bodies.\n",
            "\n",
            "But, Downing continues, Locke seems to draw just such a conclusion from Newton’s discovery of gravity: The gravitation of matter towards matter, by ways inconceivable to me, is not only a demonstration that God can, if he pleases, put into bodies powers and ways of operation above what can be derived from our idea of body, or can be explained by what we know of matter, but also an unquestionable and every where visible instance, that he has done so. And therefore in the next edition of my book I shall take care to have that passage rectified. (Works IV: 467–8) The crucial point I want to take from Downing’s account and this discussion of superaddition is that Locke’s agnosticism with respect to what we can know of the real constitutions of things beyond the ideas we have opens the door to metaphysical entities (configurations of real constitutions) that give rise to our ideas, but are not fully captured by our ideas.41 So what does this have to do with the metaphysical fact of consciousness? Just as there are real constitutions that have intrinsic to them the ability to give rise to our idea of matter or our ideas of thinking, there are real constitutions configured such that they give rise to our ideas and to the conscious experience of ourselves as perceiving ideas. Thus, there would be a metaphysical fact of consciousness that is not reducible either to thinking (or to thinking substance) or to my experience of being conscious of myself as thinking. In addition, if we interpret Locke’s view to be that the real constitutions have powers, then just as there are real constitutions with a power to think that is not always manifest in actual thinking, there are other real constitutions with a power to be conscious that is not always manifest in the consciousness that I am thinking. This sort of view is also consistent with Locke’s claims that consciousness is “inseparable” from thinking. That is, it is consistent that whenever I am thinking I am conscious that I am thinking and that thinking and consciousness are metaphysically distinct.\n",

I have argued for an interpretation that is textually supported and solves these problems. But there still remain two questions.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, are those passages arguing against the view that substance is the criterion for personal identity not equally powerful against the view that a continuing consciousness is the criterion for personal identity? That is, what about Locke’s emphasis on occurrent mental states (memory, or what I can attribute to myself) as necessary for personal identity? Locke argues that substance cannot be the criterion, since being conscious of one’s past actions (having occurrent mental states) is what generates concern, moral responsibility, and a sense of oneself through time. Therefore, when it\n",
            "\n",
            "comes to personal identity, it seems that Locke is really interested in a psychological, not a metaphysical criterion. Second, what is the relation between consciousness and those occurrent mental states (memory)? These two questions are related in that those passages arguing that personal identity does not consist in substance are mostly the same passages in which Locke refers to “consciousness” as “consciousness of past actions,” namely occurrent (or remembered) mental states. Although this is textual evidence that Locke sees the criterion of personal identity as only psychological, I will argue that Locke’s considered view of the relation between consciousness and memory cuts against this reading by requiring an actual consciousness/mind/body composite to generate those mental states required for a first-personal concern for oneself and one’s actions. The importance of our psychological states for our experience of our own identity, therefore, does not preclude that Locke’s theory also includes a metaphysical criterion.\n",
            "\n",
            "As for the first question, why would Locke allow a metaphysical criterion, a continuing consciousness, as an objective criterion for personal identity when he argues so vehemently against the view that substance can play the same role? I have four responses. First, I suggest that Locke is not against a metaphysical criterion, but only against allowing substance to serve as that criterion. As we know, Locke is agnostic as to the ultimate metaphysical nature of the world, and what we can know of it is only through our experience, namely through the ideas we have. Moreover, Locke is interested in the spatio temporal identity of things, which suggests that he is interested in actual things as they persist through time. Indeed, the first eight sections of II.xxvii are devoted to an analysis of what we should consider when we ask about the spatio temporal identity conditions of different kinds of things. In II.xxvii.8, Locke makes the point that old definitions of ‘human being’ should not rule our considerations, because the traditional idea (‘rational animal’) is ill equipped to capture what we really think human beings are. Locke’s repeating Prince Maurice’s story of the rational parrot that we would not call a man (because it does not have the right body shape) is evidence that Locke wants to reconsider identity conditions, including personal identity conditions, unhindered by traditional ideas.\n",
            "\n",
            "Second, Locke thinks, at least in principle, that bodies, minds, and consciousnesses can be separated. But though Locke’s thought experiments (about the separation and transfer of bodies, minds, and consciousnesses) are meant to drive our thinking about what constitutes personal identity, I take them to represent mere possibilities.42\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "An ontological scenario something like this is consistent with Locke’s claims about the relationships between our mental states. Locke tells us that we are conscious of all of our thinking (II.i.19) and that consciousness “is inseparable from thinking” (II.xxvii.9). But he also claims that we have periods of dreamless sleep in which there is no thinking and therefore also no consciousness that we are thinking.\n",
            "\n",
            "I have argued that consciousness in one sense is a state of awareness that I am thinking. Without consciousness, there is no experience of an I thinking. As has been noted in the literature, and as I argued in chapter two, seeing Locke to understand consciousness as identical to thinking—either first-order perception or second-order reflection—conflicts with other important commitments. We can, however, see consciousness as a self-conscious reflexive perception internal to (yet not identical to) any act of perception. This relation between our mental states is fully consistent with the claim that metaphysically we are created as body/mind/consciousness composites—or as single beings in which these parts are somehow united and act together. Likewise, the mental state that is consciousness is not identical to the mental state that is the perception of an idea; yet they are somehow united and work together. So, regardless of whatever mind/body composite my consciousness is annexed to, I will experience those thoughts as my own. I will be concerned for all those actions as if I had been unified with the mind/body composite that did them.45\n",
            "\n",
            "This is precisely why Locke, in II.xxvii.13, appeals to the “goodness of God” not to disrupt the mind/body/consciousness composite by transferring a consciousness between thinking substances.46 Therefore, my suggestion, again, is that Locke’s arguments against substance as the criterion for personal identity are not in the service of denying that something persists as the criterion for personal identity that is also metaphysically responsible for our conscious states, but only that he wants to get away from an explanation that claims that just by virtue of tradition\n",

            "Third, I suggest that although being aware of our occurrent mental states as our own is necessary for having an experience of ourselves as temporally extended and for experiencing concern for past and future pleasures and pains, it is not sufficient for personal identity. The reason is that it affords us only first-personal access to whether or not a present self is the same as a past self. To read it any other way is uncharitably to saddle Locke either with the circularity problem, with failure of transitivity, or with incoherence. Thus, given the textual evidence, we should see Locke as also including in his theory that consciousness has metaphysical duration. The ambiguity in Locke’s use of ‘consciousness’ to refer both to a state of awareness and to a continuing self can be seen as two aspects of personal identity that have separate tasks: consciousness as a mental state serves to tell me from my own first-personal observation and experience about my own identity, such that I experience my concern for myself and my own moral responsibility. The unknown configurations of the real constitutions of things serve to tell anyone else who can know it from the third-personal objective point of view (that is, God’s) whether I really am the same self.\n",

Because the Drunkard cannot prove that his inability to attribute an action to himself is due to the transference of consciousness, and we are unable to consult God, we must do the best we can epistemically from the third-personal objective point of view. Locke says, “Laws punish both with a Justice suitable to their way of Knowledge. . . . For though punishment be annexed to personality, and personality to consciousness, and the Drunkard perhaps be not conscious of what he did; yet Humane Judicatures justly punish him; because the Fact is proved against him, but want of consciousness cannot be proved for him” (II.xxvii.22). I will have more to say about this case in the next section.\n",

            "Fourth, there is a textual argument concerning the relation of consciousness to memory that supports the view that consciousness is distinct from memory and need not be understood simply as awareness of our occurrent mental states. It is true that this argument is in apparent tension with those passages that seem to identify consciousness with memory. For example, when Locke is drawing a distinction between consciousness and the soul (or thinking substance), he will refer to consciousness as “consciousness of past Actions,” as if consciousness (and therefore the criterion for personal identity) just is occurrent memory. We see this in the II.xxvii.14 discussion of the transmigration ofsouls, when Locke answers no to the question whether I am the same person as Nestor or Thersites at the siege of Troy if I have the same soul but I have no consciousness of any of their past actions. “Can he be concerned in either of their Actions? Attribute them to himself, or think them his own more than the Actions of any\n",

But notice also that in both cases Locke is emphasizing the first-personal point of view. In the case of Nestor and Thersites, I cannot identify myself with another if I cannot from my own point of view appropriate to myself what he did. In the last line of the passage about prince and the cobbler, Locke emphasizes that the prince recognizes the experience of his own mental states as his own, even though from the outside he is still the same cobbler to everyone else. The interpretation I am advocating does not deny that Locke uses ‘consciousness’ ambiguously to refer both to an occurrent mental state of awareness of ourselves and to the ongoing self I am conscious of in that mental state. In some passages, the state of awareness is emphasized, while in others the ongoing self is emphasized.48\n",

And therefore, how far the consciousness of past Actions is annexed to any individual Agent, so that\n",

But that which we call the same consciousness, not being the same individual Act, why one intellectual Substance may not have represented to it, as done by it self, what it never did, and was perhaps done by some other Agent, why I say such a representation may not possibly be without Matter of Fact, as well as several representations in Dreams are, which yet, whilst dreaming, we take for true, will be difficult to conclude from the Nature of things. And that it is never so, will by us, till we have clearer views of the Nature of thinking Substances, be best resolv’d into the Goodness of God, who as far as the Happiness or Misery of any of his sensible Creatures is concerned in it, will not by a fatal Error of theirs transfer from one to another that consciousness, which draws reward and Punishment with it. (II.xxvii.13)\n",
            "\n",
            "Since the consciousness being transferred is described as the “consciousness of past Actions,” we could read Locke to be saying that consciousness is memory. Thus, when consciousness is transferred from one thinking substance (“Agent”) to another, the memories of the actions are transferred too. So when I occupy the new substance, that substance is now responsible for all those actions that I, as the transferred consciousness, either truly or falsely remember having done. But that cannot be Locke’s view, for “punishment,” he says, “[is] annexed to personality and personality to consciousness” (II.xxvii.22). Consciousness, after all, determines the identity of the person, and it is the identity of the person that serves ultimately as the necessary condition for moral responsibility and just punishment, not the substance. So that the new substance is punished by virtue of the transferred consciousness should not be problematic. There would be no reason for Locke to think, as he seems to, that God’s intervention is needed to save us from this possibility.\n",
            "\n",
            "Moreover, this reading does not seem to be consistent with Locke’s view that consciousness transference results in the problem of false memory at all. The reason is that if consciousness is nothing more than appropriated occurrent thoughts, and consciousness is also the criterion for my identity, then it seems that nothing I remember could be false. The problem of false memory occurs only if the transferred consciousness is held accountable for something it did not do, which would have to be something not already a part of its occurrent memory. Therefore, reading consciousness as metaphysically distinct from memory makes sense of the problem of false memory. So although these passages emphasize the importance of the first-personal aspect of consciousness for generating concern for my past and future self, they do not preclude that Locke also sees consciousness as something metaphysical.50\n",
            "\n",
            "Indeed, Locke’s own account of memory seems to include a metaphysical difference between consciousness, memory, and the power of the mind to revive ideas that is suggestive of a mind/body/consciousness composite in which there are distinct powers working together to result in an experience of remembering. This brings us to the second question: What is the relation of consciousness to memory? In Locke’s II.x account of memory, we find strong evidence that consciousness, although essential to experiencing an occurrent idea as a memory, is not identical to memory. In the following passage, Locke provides some explanation for how we should think of memory and the role of consciousness in having memories: For the narrow mind of Man, not being capable of having many Ideas under View and Consideration at once, it was necessary to have a Repository, to lay up those Ideas, which at another time it might have use of. But our Ideas being nothing, but actual Perceptions in the Mind, which cease to be any thing, when there is no perception of them, this laying up of our Ideas in the Repository of Memory, signifies no more but this, that the Mind has a Power, in many cases, to revive Perceptions, which it has once had, with this additional Perception annexed to them, that it has had them before. And in this Sense it is, that our Ideas are said to be in our Memories, when indeed, they are actually no where, but only there is an ability in the Mind, when it will, to revive them again; and as it were paint them anew on it self, though some with more, some with less difficulty; some more lively, others more obscurely. (II.x.2) First, we should see memory as a kind of “Store-house” or “Repository” for ideas that the mind can no longer have in view. But having memories in a repository is not to be confused with having a collection of ideas as normally experienced, say, as images of red and yellow, that can be plucked out as is and reintroduced into the mind. Rather, Locke explains that memories cease to be ideas—in fact they “cease to be any thing”—when they are not the objects of acts of perception. The “laying up of our Ideas in the Repository of Memory,” says Locke, “signifies no more but this, that the Mind has a Power, in many cases, to revive Perceptions” that it has had before. Locke seems to be saying that an instance of remembering is the revival of something that when revived is perceived as an idea, but is not an idea prior to the revival. This is why Locke says that our ideas are “actually no where” before they are revived.\n",
            "\n",
            "Nevertheless, there has to be some more to this story, for surely Locke is not saying that the revived idea is uncaused. I suggest that there are two parts to the story. First, there is the question what it is to perceive an idea “from memory” as opposed to “from sensation” or as the result of another mental operation. Second, there is the question what a memory consists in prior to being revived.\n",
            "\n",
            "Let’s consider the first question. For Locke, the power of the understanding comprises all the powers associated with perception, or thinking (II.vi.2). Having an idea in the mind just is the exercise of the mind’s power of perception in the form of a particular mental operation, say, sensing, reflecting, contemplating, or reviving, as it is directed toward an idea. In the case of sensation, there is an impression in the senses and a power of the mind to perceive, which results in the perception of an idea\n",
            "\n",
            "of sensation (II.i.24). In the case of having a memory, there is something stored away and a power of the mind to revive (perceive) it, which results in the perception of an idea from memory. In the previous passage from II.x.2, Locke explains that when the mind exercises the power of revival, the ideas perceived come with “this additional Perception annexed to them, that it has had them before.” To repeat some of what was discussed in part II of chapter three, the “additional Perception,” Locke confirms, is due to consciousness: For to remember is to perceive anything with memory, or with a consciousness, that it was known or perceived before: without this, whatever Idea comes into the mind is new, and not remembered: This consciousness of its having been in the mind before, being that, which distinguishes Remembring from all other ways of thinking. (I.iv.20)\n",

When I perceive an idea of an external object by way of sensation, I am conscious that it is from sensation. At the risk of repeating this passage yet again, Locke says: But yet here, I think, we are provided with an Evidence, that puts us past doubting: For I ask any one, Whether he be not invincibly conscious to himself of a different Perception, when he looks on the Sun by day, and thinks on it by night. . . . We as plainly find the difference there is between an Idea revived in our Minds by our own Memory, and actually coming into our Minds by our own Senses. (IV.ii.14)\n",

            "What is more, defects of memory, for Locke, are defects in thinking, that is, defects involved in reviving ideas, not defects in the consciousness that the ideas revived are from memory. Locke describes the two defects of memory as “ignorance,” when the mind “loses the Idea” completely, and “stupidity,” when the mind acts so slowly that the ideas are not revived “when need and occasion calls for them” (II.x.8). In either case, forgetfulness has nothing to do with consciousness. True, to have the experience that I am remembering or that I am the same self now that I was in the past requires that I be able to revive an idea. But this does not mean that what is involved in reviving an idea should be identified with the consciousness that I have had that idea before.\n",

And, although, for Locke, all thinking is conscious, the ideas must be revived before what is in the mind counts as thinking—since thinking just is having ideas.

            "We get some indication of what this something might be for Locke at the end of II.x. Here Locke argues that not only humans but other animals, too, have this “faculty of laying up, and retaining the Ideas, that are brought into the mind” (II.x.10). Not only do sounds “mechanically cause a certain motion of the animal Spirits, in the Brains of those Birds, whilst the tune is actually playing,” which then results in particular motions of the wings or body, but also birds are able to recall a sequence of notes when they are no longer directly affected through their senses or when the imitation is necessary for preservation. What explains memory in the case of other animals? Locke says: But which is more, it cannot with any appearance of Reason, be supposed (much less proved) that Birds, without Sense and Memory, can approach their Notes, nearer and nearer by degrees, to a Tune play’d yesterday; which if they have no Idea of in their Memory, is now no-where, nor can be a Pattern for them to imitate, or which any repeated Essays can bring them nearer to. Since there is no reason why the sound of a Pipe should leave traces in their Brains, which not at first, but by their after-endeavors, should produce the like Sounds; and why the Sounds they make themselves, should not make traces which they should follow, as well as those of the Pipe, is impossible to conceive. (II.x.10)\n",
            "\n",
            "Although a little difficult to follow, Locke is suggesting that the ability birds have to repeat a pattern or imitate a tune is due to the ability to record what they have experienced as traces in the brain, which “by their after-endeavours” result in a later production of those sounds.51 It is quite plausible to think that the case is similar in human beings. What is laid up or stored away “in memory” are traces in the brain that with an effort of the mind to revive become ideas perceived in the mind.52\n",
            "\n",
            "We see a similar account of a relation between the mind and the body in the perception of ideas in Locke’s II.i.23 account of the “origin” of ideas. Having ideas in the mind, Locke says there, is “coeval with Sensation”; which is such an Impression or Motion, made in some part of the Body, as produces some perception in the Understanding. ’Tis about these Impressions made on our Senses by outward Objects, that the Mind seems first to employ it self in such Operations as we call Perception, Remembring, Consideration, Reasoning, etc. (II.i.23)\n",

            "Just as there is an impression in the sense organs before there can be a perception of an idea of sensation, there is some sort of imprinting or impression made in the brain before there can be a revival of an idea from memory. The remembered idea is the result of the mind turning toward what is retained in the perceptual act of reviving.\n",
            "\n",
            "That the precursors of revived ideas are likely located in the brain (or perhaps in the “animal spirits”) is acknowledged by Locke in his admission that brain deterioration or other diseases of the body can result in the erasure of memory: How much the Constitution of our Bodies, and the make of our animal Spirits, are concerned in this; and whether the Temper of the Brain makes this difference, that in some it retains the Characters drawn on it like Marble, in others like Free-stone, and in others little better than Sand, I shall not here enquire, though it may seem probable, that the Constitution of the Body does sometimes influence Memory; since we oftentimes find a Disease quite strip the Mind of all its Ideas, and the flames of a Fever, in a few days, calcine all those Images to dust and confusion, which seem’d to be as lasting, as if graved in Marble. (II.x.5) Other passages confirm that what is retained in memory can be explained by traces or “impressions” that are made in the brain. In II.i.15, in his response to the Cartesian claim that the soul always thinks but while sleeping does not retain it, Locke considers how something like that could happen: Perhaps it will be said, that in a waking Man, the materials of the Body are employ’d, and made use of, in thinking; and that the memory of Thoughts, is retained by the impressions that are made on the Brain, and the traces there left after such thinking; but that in the thinking of the Soul, which is not perceived in a sleeping Man, there the Soul thinks apart, and making no use of the Organs of the Body, leaves no impressions on it, and consequently no memory of such Thoughts. (II.i.15)\n",
            "\n",
            "Although Locke responds to this suggestion by saying that if the soul can “receive, and contemplate, without the help of the Body,” then surely “it can retain without the help of the Body too,” his point is that, regardless of whether thinking is material or immaterial or some combination of both, it cannot be that whatever does the thinking would have the capacity for thinking and not also for retaining what it thinks.53 So it cannot be that dreamless sleep is due to a separation of what thinks from what retains the thinking, in this case the soul from the body. Rather, it has to do with the manifestation and interaction of the powers of whatever constitutes the actual metaphysical mind/body/consciousness composite.\n",
            "\n",
            "There is an apparent tension here with Locke’s example of the prince and the cobbler. If memories are stored in the body, then how can the “soul of the Prince, carrying with it the consciousness of the Prince’s past Life, enter and inform the body of the Cobler” (II.xxvii.15)? It would seem that there could be no memory transferred. I suggest we need not read the passage that way, for having “Princely\n",

            "Thoughts” can be only a matter of assigning the prince’s experience of himself to whatever thoughts he currently has. This is consistent with the interpretation of appropriation discussed earlier. Moreover, we could read Locke to be saying that for the prince (in the cobbler’s body) to be accountable for an action he need only be having an occurrent thought of a particular action, which can be a transferred occurrent idea that does not need to be revived. Finally, were we to insist that the collection of memories themselves are what is transferred and so what is necessary for attributing identity to oneself, then we have made Locke, once again, guilty of circularity or of other inconsistencies.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, there is one other somewhat unrelated piece of textual evidence that memory consists in traces in the brain. Locke attributes hallucinations, which on his model of the mind can only be ideas retrieved from memory, to the “Reveries of a crazy Brain” (IV.iv.2).54\n",
            "\n",
            "Although Locke never says explicitly that memories are retained as traces in the brain, it is consistent with his agnosticism with respect to the nature of thinking substance and with respect to the metaphysics of causal relations not to delve into any substantive explanation. On the very first page of the Essay, Locke declines to “meddle” in such philosophical issues: I shall not at present meddle with any Physical Consideration of the Mind; or trouble myself to examine, wherein its Essence consists, or by what Motions of our Spirits, or Alterations of our Bodies, we come to have any Sensation by our Organs, or any Ideas in our Understandings; and whether those Ideas do in their Formation, any, or all of them, depend on Matter, or no. (I.i.2)\n",
            "\n",
            "So, Locke’s failure to go into any detail as to what memory consists in is due to his insistent neutrality on the nature of ideas, on the relation between real constitutions and powers, between the mind and the body, between an act of thinking and our consciousness of it, or even between an objectively existing continuing consciousness and the conscious state of itself as thinking. Moreover, that Locke proclaimed his agnosticism with respect to these issues leaves little room for speculation. What is clear, however, is that Locke is distinguishing the causal precursors to revived ideas from those ideas as revived. And if we must be conscious of ourselves as perceiving revived ideas, because all thinking is conscious, yet the causal precursors to those ideas are “no thing” to us, then Locke must be thinking that consciousness is distinct from, yet somehow united to and working with, memory.\n",

            "There is one final worry: If being able to attribute a past action to ourselves is necessary in order not to be “created miserable,” then it seems that on my interpretation Locke is committed to bodily resurrection, and even perhaps to having the\n",
            "\n",
            "same body resurrected. Locke, however, seems to deny explicitly that necessarily I appear on the “Great Day” with the same body: The Sentence shall be justified by the consciousness all Persons shall have, that they themselves in what Bodies soever they appear, or what Substances soever that consciousness adheres to, are the same, that committed those Actions, and deserve that Punishment for them.

Nay, which is very remarkable in the case, I do not remember any place in the New Testament (where the general resurrection at the last day is spoken of) any such expression as the resurrection of the body, much less the same body.

But this need not be seen as in conflict with the view that stored memory consists in causal traces in the brain for two reasons. First, as far as we can know, God can restore to any particular body those causal traces corresponding to my particular experience. The reason is that God has something objective to look to in determining what those causal traces should be. Therefore, if Locke’s view is that I must revive and experience as mine the appropriate idea of a past action, then there does not seem to be a problem. Second, if Locke’s view is that I do not have to do the reviving myself, then it seems that we do not need the causal traces at all. God could just as easily restore in any moment any particular ideas I need to be conscious of in order to satisfy the criterion that I am not punished for what I have no awareness of having done.\n",

Instead, there is a metaphysical fact of an ongoing self that does this explanatory work. Locke also seems to think that we have an experience of ourselves as temporally extended—as the same self in the past and the present: For as far as any intelligent Agent can repeat the Idea of any past Action with the same consciousness it has of any present Action. . . . For it is by the consciousness it has of its present Thoughts and Actions, that it is self to it self now, and so will be the same self as far as the same consciousness can extend to Actions past or to come.

I will cite many of those passages in the next chapter when I take a more comprehensive look at the unity of consciousness and establish its importance for moral agency. For now, it suffices to consider Locke’s example above of a person “repeating the Idea of any past Action with the same consciousness [she] has of [her] present Thoughts and Actions,” which is what happens when we think about, or reflect on, our past.56 Consistent with Locke’s model of the mind, in so reflecting on my past actions, I have a unified experience of myself as extending into the past. More specifically, there are two simultaneous perceptions in my mind: a present reflection and a revived idea that is the object of the reflection. (Remember that “reviving,” for Locke, is an act of perception.) But I am also conscious of myself as internal to each perception. If there is the same internal experience of myself—the same first-personal character—as both reflecting and remembering (reviving), then there is a unified experience of myself as perceiving from the past to the present.57\n",

As we know from his version of the cogito argument, Locke is clear that we have the highest degree of certainty with respect to our knowledge of a synchronically existing self. Therefore, I have the highest degree of knowledge that the objectively existing self I am conscious I am perceiving in that moment exists. The question then concerns the extent to which I can claim to know that I exist diachronically. Here there are two things to say—one from the point of view of what we experience in virtue of our psychological states and the other from the point of view of what meets a higher epistemic standard. First, from the point of view of my own experience I do not differentiate between the synchronic and the\n",

Drawing a comparison between Locke and Descartes and their different requirements for what counts as knowledge of the synchronic and diachronic existence of the self is helpful here. Descartes establishes the synchronic existence of the self through the cogito argument: “So after considering everything very thoroughly, I must finally conclude that this proposition, I am, I exist, is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind” (CSM II: 16; AT VII: 25). Now it is not in the least controversial to attribute to Descartes the view that we also continue to exist through time.58 But Descartes struggles with establishing the fact of the diachronically existing self. In the “Synopsis” to the Meditations, Descartes admits that in order to establish the continuity of the soul, and thus its immortality, he would have to give “an account of the whole of physics” (CSM II: 10; AT VII: 14). For to know that substances continue to exist depends on knowing that “absolutely all substances, which must be created by God in order to exist, are by their nature incorruptible and cannot ever cease to exist unless they are reduced to nothingness by God’s denying his concurrence to them” (CSM II: 10; AT VII: 14). Establishing the fact of our diachronic existence requires both that we establish the fact that we are incorruptible substances, which requires a full account of physics, and that God does not deny his concurrent activity such that we cease to exist.\n",

            "Descartes, as we know, has a very high standard for knowledge. This is one place where Locke’s epistemology departs from Descartes’s.59 As we saw in part III of chapter three, Locke has different epistemic standards. Knowledge comes in different degrees depending on the way in which we perceive agreements and then to what extent we are rationally justified in accepting what is presented to us in virtue of our perceptual situations. Intuitive and sensitive knowledge present similar perceptual situations: There is an immediate experience of certainty just in virtue of the perception of the agreement.60 Nevertheless, Locke maintains that intuitive and sensitive\n",

My knowledge that there really and actually exists something external to me is immediate and psychologically unavoidable. But, unlike my experience in having intuitive knowledge, when I step back from my sensitive knowledge and ask whether I should accept what is so very certain to me, there is room for doubt.

Like both intuitive and sensitive knowledge, “I continue to exist,” or “I am the same self now as I was then” is given to me as internal to this complex mental state. In virtue of my perceptual situation, I have the immediate certainty that I continue to exist. But like sensitive knowledge, when I step back and question what is so very certain to me in virtue of my psychological experience, there is room for doubt. Just as it is possible—though highly unlikely—that all is a dream or that I am the victim of an evil demon, it is possible—though highly unlikely—that I do not continue to exist through my gaps in memory or even between those discrete instances in which I am conscious of myself as perceiving successive ideas.61\n",

In cognizing my own identity I attend to the persistence of the I against the background of “successive determinations” of the I, namely through the time of the successive instances of the I as thinking. Since time is the form of inner sense, the experience of my own thinking is necessarily of myself as unified in time. Kant states, “The identity of the person is therefore inevitably to be encountered in my own consciousness.”62 Even so, for Kant, we cannot from the inevitability of our own cognitive experience draw the further conclusion that we are something persisting through time: For we cannot judge even from our own consciousness whether as soul we are persisting or not, because we ascribe to our identical Self only that of which we are conscious; and so we must necessarily judge that we are the very same in the whole of the time of which we are conscious.\n",

Therefore, Locke continues that Humane Laws punish both [the drunkard and the sleepwalker] with a Justice suitable to their way of Knowledge: Because in these cases, they cannot distinguish certainly what is real, what counterfeit; and so the ignorance in Drunkenness or Sleep is not admitted as a plea. For though punishment be annexed to personality, and personality to consciousness, and the Drunkard perhaps be not conscious of what he did; yet Human Judicatures justly punish him; because the Fact is proved against him, but want of consciousness cannot be proved for him.

Indeed, Locke asserts that in some matters of fact, especially those that are of great concern to us, the “Probabilities rise so near to certainty . . . we make little or no difference between them and certain knowledge” (IV.xvi.6).

It is a very remote possibility, but a possibility nonetheless—much like the possibility that all is a dream or that I am the victim of an evil demon. But Locke has a solution to this too. In the extraordinarily unlikely event that the drunkard’s lack of memory actually does correspond to a gap in his continued existence, God will ensure his just deserts. Once all of one’s continued existence is accounted for in the day of reckoning, “no one shall be made to answer for what he knows nothing of.” Locke’s example of the drunkard confronts us with the limits of our knowledge. Why Locke thinks such limitations need not concern us is that God makes sure we are sufficiently supplied with what we need.\n",

            "God, therefore, rectifies the limits of our understanding by punishment suitable to God’s way of knowledge. Even though my knowledge of the metaphysical fact of my diachronic existence is incomplete, and hence I do not know all that I have done, God does. Locke assures us that “conformable” to the fact that we are not “created miserable”: At the Great Day, when every one shall receive according to his doings, the secrets of all hearts shall be laid open. The sentence shall be justified by the consciousness all Persons shall have,\n",

            "To be created miserable would be to have no control over my own happiness or misery, namely to be eternally damned for that which I bear no responsibility. And even though, for Locke, it is important that I know what I did in order to be justly punished for it, whether or not I actually did something is not dependent on whether I know (or remember) it. Therefore, God, as omniscient, need only look to all that I, as an objectively existing diachronic self, have done in order to reward or punish me.\n",

            "\n",
            "## 4.4 Conclusion Traditionally, Locke is considered to have a psychological account of personal identity that relies on consciousness as the criterion. The criticisms it has faced are numerous. If the psychological theory is taken also as a metaphysical theory, then there is a problem of circularity. If Locke is interpreted to have an appropriation theory, in which the first-personal attribution to ourselves of occurrent mental states is sufficient for personal identity, then the theory fails transitivity or it is ill equipped to meet the demands of Locke’s commitment to divine rectification. Consciousness must be something persisting metaphysically for there to be sufficient connectivity through memory between past and present selves for transitivity to hold and for there to be something for God to look to in determining those actions for which we can be justly punished or rewarded. Those who bolster a reliance on appropriation with a causal relation between an idea originally perceived and an idea revived from memory may provide enough for divine rectification, but they saddle Locke with an inconsistency when it comes to his claims about consciousness transference and false memory. And those interpretations do not resolve the problem of transitivity.\n",
            "\n",
            "Moreover, Locke is adamant that the objective metaphysical criterion, what has ongoing continuity, is not substance, nor did he give a nod to the “probable Opinion” that it might be a mode. I have argued, rather, that Locke remains agnostic about the metaphysics of an enduring consciousness except that it is consistent with a broader metaphysics of real constitutions and power. Consistent with this view, I have argued that Locke sees persons as mind/body/consciousness composites in which all three components are configurations of real constitutions that are somehow united. In\n",
            "\n",
            "addition, I have argued that Locke’s metaphysical account of memory as consisting in causal traces in the brain helps to support the interpretation that we are mind/body/ consciousness composites, and that although occurrent mental states are necessary to experience and identify myself as the same self, it is the ongoing consciousness that does the work from a third-personal point of view. Thus, I have succeeded in solving all three of the problems traditionally associated with Locke’s theory of personal identity, and I have done it without causing tensions elsewhere in Locke’s philosophy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, I have argued that Locke uses ‘consciousness’ ambiguously both to mean a state of awareness of myself as thinking and as the ongoing self I am aware of in that conscious state. Where the metaphysical fact of my ongoing self is revealed to me as a phenomenological experience of a diachronic self, the metaphysical fact (known only to God) is beyond my ken. Analogously to both the epistemic achievements and limitations of sensitive knowledge, I have the utmost psychological certainty that I exist in every moment, but that knowledge does not stand up to a second-order normative challenge.\n",
            "\n",
            "Having shown the role consciousness plays in Locke’s account of personal identity, I now want to turn to the role it plays in his account of moral agency and more specifically in his account of freedom and moral motivation. First, that we are able to exercise moral agency is tied to the fact that we are the kind of self-conscious beings we are, namely beings with an intellectual nature conscious of pleasure and pain, and so concerned for our own true happiness. In addition, as we have seen only briefly, consciousness as intrinsic to every perception of an idea allows that we can experience unity of consciousness, that is, experience ourselves as extended into the past. Such an experience affords us the opportunity to see past thoughts and actions as ours and thus to be morally accountable for them. But also Locke thinks we experience ourselves as extending into the future. That we experience unity of consciousness in this direction allows us to exercise our agency in the pursuit of long-term happiness, namely the kind of happiness suitable to a moral being.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the suspension of desire necessary to Locke’s account of moral agency requires some sort of motivation. I argue that that motivation comes from a natural concern we have for our own true happiness that is grounded in the fact that we are the kind of self-conscious beings that we are—intellectual beings conscious of their own pleasures and pains. This latter argument, establishing the motivating power of our concern for true happiness, is the primary focus of this chapter and to what I will turn first. As is well known, in response to concerns expressed by Molyneux and others about his original account of moral action, Locke revised his view significantly for the second edition of the Essay. In what follows, I will be considering only the account of moral agency and motivation as we find it in the second through fifth editions.\n",
            "\n",
            "Locke’s theory of moral motivation is grounded in our natural responses to feelings of pleasure and pain. Feelings of pain lead to desires, which move the will to act to attain the objects of those desires. Attaining those objects, what Locke calls “absent goods,” results in pleasure—the alleviation of pain. What is more, “Happiness . . . in its full extent is the utmost Pleasure we are capable of, and Misery the utmost Pain: And the lowest degree of what can be called Happiness, is so much ease from all Pain, . . . as without which any one cannot be content” (II.xxi.42). Locke links our natural\n",
            "\n",
            "motivation to alleviate pain to our physical self-preservation. He writes of “the Wisdom and Goodness of our Maker, who designing the preservation of our being, has annexed Pain to the application of many things to our Bodies, to warn us of the harm they will do; and as advices to withdraw from them” (II.vii.4). Such motivation to physical preservation is a way in which we are naturally constructed, helping to put us on the path to happiness rather than misery. Indeed, Locke thinks that were we not naturally able to avoid things that lead to our own demise, we would be “created miserable.”1 In this chapter, I argue that just as we have a natural drive toward our own physical self-preservation here and now, we also have a natural drive toward our long-term preservation, what Locke calls our “true” or “real” happiness, which consists in attaining the most pleasure in this life and the next. To attain long-term happiness, though, we must be able to choose greater goods, including those that might make us suffer now but bring more pleasure later. And doing that requires that we have the freedom to forbear acting on a present desire. Locke thinks that we do have such freedom, for we are able to suspend desire in order to deliberate over the relative pleasures of competing goods. In Locke’s moral theory, this means we can consider our actions insofar as they compare to laws, conferring on us moral agency and moral responsibility. But only desire moves the will to an action, so there must be a desire that results in the suspension of desire. The scholarship has been generally satisfied with attributing this motivation to a desire for happiness in general, but there is little agreement with respect to how to interpret it. Chappell (2000: 242), for example, argues that the desire for happiness in general moves the will to suspend desire: “this desire constitutes a constant and unalterable spur to the will, a source of motivation over and above that which is made up of the sundry particular uneasinesses that fill our daily lives.” Yaffe (2000: 57) grounds what he calls the “Elusive Something,” namely that which grounds any liberty “worth the name” in the desire for happiness in general, which pursuit he understands as not only choosing the good, “but to track the good, to be ‘tied’ to the good no matter where it lies.” Bolton (2008: 262) considers the desire for happiness in general an “innate conative principle” by virtue of which “Locke’s theory gives everyone a motive to inquire about the prospect of happiness or misery after death” in an argument establishing the way in which Locke sees the difference between moral and cognitive duties. LoLordo (2012: 59) takes a more agnostic view, arguing that the “most plausible conclusion is that Locke simply does not know what, if anything, causes suspension.” Schouls (1992: 145) argues that the will to suspend desire is not “to be explained through the kind of uneasiness that\n",
            "\n",
            "Although Locke uses the term only with reference to being punished for actions that we cannot attribute to ourselves, he also says, “And to receive Pleasure or Pain; i.e. Reward or Punishment, on the account of any such Action, is all one, as to be made happy or miserable in its first being, without any demerit at all . . . what difference is there between that Punishment, and being created miserable?” (II.xxvii.26).\n",
            "\n",
            "I take this to mean more generally that being in a state in which we cannot but receive pain or misery through no fault of our own, say, because God has not fitted us with what we need to attain happiness (or avoid misery), is the same as “to be made happy or miserable in its first being.”\n",
            "\n",
            "would make these acts manifestations of the mechanism of nature.” Stuart (2013: 473) provides a detailed account of the two views in the scholarship as well as good textual evidence that although at times Locke might have seemed to lean toward incompatibilism, “All told, there is little evidence that Locke took himself to have offered a solution to the problem of freedom and determinism, and even less that he saw our capacity to suspend the prosecution of desires as a way of resisting incorporation into the mechanism of nature.”2 Unfortunately, Locke seems not to provide us much explicit help with answering the question of what causes suspension. But he does say, “Whatever necessity determines to the pursuit of real Bliss, the same necessity, with the same force establishes suspence, deliberation, and scrutiny of each successive desire, whether the satisfaction of it, does not interfere with our true happiness, and mislead us from it” (II.xxi.52). I argue that this necessity, the motivation to pursue “real Bliss”—the same force that establishes the suspension of a desire—is a natural motivation, which Locke often calls our “concern” for our own true happiness.\n",
            "\n",
            "To make my case, I will begin, in section 5.1, by drawing out the analogy between present self-preservation and long-term preservation. Section 5.2 argues that even though what is good just is what brings pleasure, Locke distinguishes between pleasure and what he calls “true” happiness, which culminates, ultimately, in an afterlife. In section 5.3, I argue that the motivation to pursue true happiness grounds the freedom Locke thinks is necessary to having moral agency. I also argue that this motivation Locke often calls our “concern” or “concernment” that we gain true happiness. In section 5.4, I tie together consciousness, concern, and moral agency by arguing that the concern for our happiness generally, that it is “true” happiness, is linked to the fact that we are the kind of self-conscious beings we are—that is, beings conscious of their own pleasure and pain, but also with an intellectual nature and so capable of moral agency. I then show, in section 5.5, the importance of the unity of consciousness in Locke’s account of moral agency. Finally, in the last section, I explain why animals, even though conscious (and even self-conscious) for Locke, fail to be moral agents.\n",
            "\n",
            "## 5.1 Motivation, Self-Preservation, and Happiness Locke divides the mind into “two great and principal Actions . . . : Perception, or Thinking, and Volition, or Willing. The Power of Thinking is called the Understanding, and the Power of Volition is called the Will” (II.vi.2).3 Although Locke uses the language of “faculties” to talk about both the understanding and the will, he warns us\n",
            "\n",
            "that he does not mean by “faculty” what most take it to mean. Talk of “faculties,” he says, “has misled many into a confused Notion of so many distinct Agents in us, which had their several Provinces and Authorities, and did command, obey, and perform several Actions, as so many distinct Beings” (II.xxi.6). Rather, Locke sees both the understanding and the will as a power or ability, the exercise of which is perception, or perceiving, and volition, or willing. Locke’s II.xxi. chapter On Power, among other things, contains his theory of action. Actions require, or are at least accompanied by, prior volitions. Locke acknowledges that it is hard to explain exactly what volition is, but if we look to what we do when we will, we might use the terms, “Ordering, Directing, Chusing, Preferring” (II.xxi.15). But he is quick to admit that none of these terms perfectly captures it. For example, someone might prefer to fly rather than to walk, but it cannot be the case that anyone actually wills flying over walking. In general, though, Locke thinks the following is the best description of volition, or willing: “Volition, . . . [is] an Act of the Mind knowingly exerting that Dominion it takes itself to have over any part of the Man, by imploying it in, or withholding it from any particular Action” (II.xxi.15). It is whatever we do when we move from thinking about doing something to actually doing it (or not doing it).4\n",
            "\n",
            "What activates the will such that we are moved to pursue an action? Only desire, or what Locke also calls “uneasiness,” moves the will:5 To return then to the Enquiry, what is it that determines the Will in regard to our Actions? And that upon second thoughts I am apt to imagine is not, as is generally supposed, the greater good in view: But some (and for the most part pressing) uneasiness a Man is at present under. This is that which successively determines the Will, and sets us upon those Actions, we perform. This Uneasiness we may call, as it is, Desire; which is an uneasiness of the Mind for want of some absent good. All pain of the body of what sort soever, and disquiet of the mind, is uneasiness: And with this is always join’d Desire, equal to the pain or uneasiness felt; and is scarce distinguishable from it. For desire being nothing but an uneasiness in the want of an absent good, in reference to any pain felt, ease is that absent good; and till that ease be attained, we may call it desire, no body feeling pain, that he wishes not to be erased of, with a desire equal to that pain, and inseparable from it. (II.xxi.31)\n",
            "\n",
            "How to distinguish desire from uneasiness is not readily clear. Locke will sometimes speak of desire and uneasiness as if they are the same and sometimes as if they are different. I think the above passage makes the distinction. Uneasiness, I take to be equivalent to pain. When we have uneasiness, we have pain. When the pain is associated with an absent good, namely something perceived to alleviate the pain and thus restore us to a state of ease, we have a desire. Desires, then, are always connected with some specific absent good.\n",
            "\n",
            "One might, however, see the distinction somewhat differently. Uneasiness would be the genus of which pain is a species. That is, uneasinesses come in a spectrum, with pain at the painful end of that spectrum. Although I am open to the suggestion, I am not sure that is what Locke has in mind for the following reasons. First, when Locke first mentions our simple ideas of pleasure and pain, he lists them in the following way: “Pleasure, or Delight, and its opposite Pain, or Uneasiness” (II.vii.1). Here Locke seems to be using the “or” in both cases appositively, which signals equivalence. Second, Locke says, “Delight, or Uneasiness, one or other of them join themselves to almost all our Ideas, both of Sensation and Reflection: And there is scarce any affection of our Senses from without, any retired thought of our Mind within, which is not able to produce in us pleasure or pain” (II.vii.2). Given that virtually all our ideas come with some sort of pleasure or pain, Locke seems to be using “pain” to designate “uneasiness” as opposed to the narrower category of uneasinesses that are truly painful. And although Locke goes on to list what appears to be gradations of pleasures and pains when he says, “For whether we call it Satisfaction, Delight, Pleasure, Happiness, etc. on the one side; or Uneasiness, Trouble, Pain, Torment, Anguish, Misery, etc. on the other,” he seems again to equate “pain” with “uneasiness” when he continues the sentence with “they are still but different degrees of the same thing, and belong to the Ideas of Pleasure and Pain, Delight or Uneasiness; which are the Names I shall most commonly use for those two sorts of Ideas” (II.vii.2). Interesting as the question is, I do not think anything in my coming arguments hangs on which interpretation one chooses.\n",
            "\n",
            "Even though desires are always connected with an absent good, Locke also admits that we can consider an absent good without feeling uneasy. We will not feel any uneasiness as long as we are content with what we are doing or with what we have (or do not have): When a Man is perfectly content with the State he is in, which is when he is perfectly without any uneasiness, what industry, what action, what Will is there left, but to continue in it? Of this every Man’s observation will satisfy him. (II.xxi.34) If it is natural to continue an action as long as it brings pleasure, then one might want to ask why we would ever discontinue a pleasurable activity. Locke answers: And thus we see our All-wise Maker, suitable to our constitution and frame, and knowing what it is that determines the Will, has put into man the uneasiness of hunger and thirst, and other natural desires, that return at their Seasons, to move and determine their Wills, for the preservation of themselves, and the continuation of their species.

(II.vii.4)6 These passages confirm that we have a natural motivation to change course when our physical preservation is threatened. When I look up to the sky, if the light is too bright, I am naturally moved to a different action: to stop looking at the sun. We are naturally moved from that which causes pain to that which alleviates it, or toward that which brings pleasure.\n",

            "I suggest that Locke can be seen to have a similar naturalistic explanation of how we can be moved to pursue goods other than those necessary for the present preservation of the body. Consider, first, this passage: Let a Man never be so well perswaded of the advantages of virtue, that it is as necessary to a Man, who has any great aims in this World, or hopes in the next, as food to life: yet till he hungers and thirsts after righteousness; till he feels an uneasiness in the want of it, his will will not be determin’d to any action in pursuit of this confessed greater good; but any other uneasinesses he feels in himself, shall take place, and carry his will to other actions. (II.xxi.35)\n",
            "\n",
            "Locke’s point is that mere persuasion that a virtuous life is better is not enough to motivate us to choose it. How, then, do we come to experience the uneasiness necessary to cause a change in a present state or manner of living, say, from a nonvirtuous to a virtuous life? Locke answers this question with an allusion to those natural pains/uneasinesses leading to the preservation of the body. Virtue, he says, is as necessary to a good life in this world and a better one in the next as food is to the preservation of present physical life. We have to “hunger and thirst” after righteousness. We have to feel the pain that the absence of righteousness brings about, just as we hunger and thirst after bodily sustenance, namely feel the uneasiness that the absence of food and water brings about. In other words, virtue is necessary to our long-term happiness in this life and the next, just as food and water are necessary to our preservation here and now.7\n",
            "\n",
            "This argument may invite the objection that Locke uses “virtue” and “vice” to refer only to the keeping of those “Law[s] of Opinion or Reputation,” that are relative to “Societies, Tribes, and Clubs of Men in the World” (II.xxviii.10). I suggest, though, that Locke actually distinguishes real virtue and vice from what in different societies is countenanced by laws of reputation as virtue and vice. He says, “Vertue and Vice are Names pretended, and supposed every where to stand for actions in their own nature right and wrong: And as far as they really are so applied, they so far are co-incident with the divine Law above-mentioned” (II.xxviii.10). What Locke seems to be saying is that we normally use the terms “virtue” and “vice” as if they denoted objective determinations of right and wrong actions. But really they stand only for what any particular society deems right and wrong actions. In the last part of the passage, though, Locke admits that one correctly uses “virtue” and “vice” to stand for what is objectively right and wrong when those terms describe actions that are “co-incident with divine Law.” So, Locke must be thinking that there is a way to talk about virtue and vice that is not relative to the laws of reputation of a particular society.\n",

First, he cites the following passage from II.xxviii.11. “Men . . . did not for the most part much vary from the Law of Nature, which is that standing and unalterable Rule, by which they ought to judge the moral rectitude and pravity of their actions, and accordingly denominate them Vertues or Vices.” He then explains, Here and in other places Locke’s talk of the law of reputation and the divine law (revealed or law of nature) suggests two distinct standards of morality which may in some particular coincide in their content, so that what counts as a virtuous or a vicious act according to the one may similarly so count as the other. Locke may, however, be read somewhat differently, as concerned with how persons see the precepts of morality. Those who assess their actions in terms of the law of reputation see these precepts as what is socially approved or disapproved, and share society’s approval or disapproval. Those who assess them in terms of the divine law see moral precepts as the law of God. The heathen philosopher perceives morality in the former of these ways, the Christian in the latter.

Because Locke thinks that only the just are preserved in an afterlife, where the wicked are extinguished, we can also see the analogy in this way: Just as we are naturally driven to avoid present bodily deterioration and premature death, we also are naturally driven to avoid longer-term pains and punishments and eventual annihilation.8 So, in both cases, were we not motivated to that which preserves us, we would not be in a position to attain happiness, which “in its full extent,” Locke explains, “is the utmost Pleasure we are capable of ” (II.xxi.42).\n",

That we are so naturally motivated in the direction of longer-term (future) happiness is suggested in the next passage: Beyond all this [pains naturally annexed to objects dangerous to our bodily preservation], we may find another reason why God hath scattered up and down several degrees of Pleasure and Pain, in all the things that environ and affect us; and blended them together, in almost all that our Thoughts and Senses have to do with; that we finding imperfection, dissatisfaction, and want of complete happiness, in all the Enjoyments which the Creatures can afford us, might be led to seek it in the enjoyment of him, with whom there is fullness of joy, and at whose right hand are the pleasures for evermore.

Let us begin with Locke’s account of motivation generally. With respect to any good, greater or not, “I am sure,” says Locke, “whereever there is uneasiness there is desire: For we constantly desire happiness; and whatever we feel of uneasiness, so much, ’tis certain, we want of happiness” (II.xxi.39).10 So, happiness (in its full extent the utmost pleasure) is the removal of pain or uneasiness and what we desire most and constantly.11\n",

            "Locke continues his analysis by telling us that whatever brings pleasure is good and whatever brings pain is evil. But that does not mean that goods cannot be compared or measured against one another, such that a greater one wins out: Farther, though what is apt to produce any degree of Pleasure, be in it self good; and what is apt to produce any degree of Pain, be evil; yet it often happens, that we do not call it so, when it comes in competition with a greater of its sort; because when they come in competition the degrees also of Pleasure and Pain have justly a preference. So that if we will rightly estimate what we call Good and Evil, we shall find it lies much in comparison: For the cause of every less degree of Pain, as well as every greater degree of Pleasure has the nature of good, and vice versa. (II.xxi.43)\n",
            "\n",
            "Indeed, when it comes to comparing the pleasures of competing goods, it makes a lot of difference what we are presently experiencing. Often what happens is that a present pain will easily trump the promise of a future pleasure, so that we have neither the time nor the inclination to pursue more goods or those other than what demands our immediate attention. If we spend most of our time working for food and shelter, namely avoiding the pains of hunger and cold, then we have not much time or interest to pursue other sorts of pleasures, say, those to be gained from more leisured activities.\n",

Because our happiness comes mostly from alleviating pain, and we are constantly bombarded with sundry pains of varying degrees, we are much too busy with those pains to generate equally forceful, or even at times any, desires for greater goods. “The reason whereof,” explains Locke, “is evident from the nature of our happiness and misery it self. All present pain, whatever it be, makes a part of our present misery: But all absent good does not at any time make a necessary part of our present happiness, nor the absence of it make a part of our misery” (II.xxi.44). Locke continues: We are seldom at ease, and free enough from the sollicitation of our natural or adopted desires, but a constant succession of uneasinesses out of that stock, which natural wants, or acquired habits have heaped up, take the will in their turns; and no sooner is one action dispatch’d, which by such a determination of the will we are set upon, but another uneasiness is ready to set us on work. For the removing of the pains we feel, and are at present pressed with, being the getting out of misery, and consequently the first thing to be done in order to happiness, absent good, though thought on, confessed, and appearing to be good, not making any part of this unhappiness in its absence, is jostled out, to make way for the removal of those uneasinesses we [currently] feel.

            "Furthermore, even though we all tend toward happiness, different people experience pleasures differently, which means that happiness is not necessarily achieved by pursuing the same pleasures: The Mind has a different relish, as well as the Palate; and you will as fruitlessly endeavour to delight all Men with Riches or Glory, (which yet some Men place their Happiness in,) as you would satisfy all Men’s Hunger with Cheese or Lobsters; which, though very agreeable and delicious fare to some, are to others extremely nauseous and offensive.

Men may chuse different things, and yet all chuse right, supposing them only like a Company of poor Insects, whereof some are Bees, delighted with Flowers, and their sweetness; others, Beetles, delighted with other kinds of Viands; which having enjoyed for a season, they should cease to be, and exist no more for ever.

Under the supposition that we are not insects, we are able to compare goods in terms of the pleasures they promise instead of flitting from one to another depending on what delights us in the moment.

In this we should take pains to suit the relish of our Minds to the true intrinsick good or ill, that is in things; and not permit an allow’d or supposed possible great and weighty good to slip out of our thoughts, without leaving any relish, any desire of it self there, till, by due consideration of its true worth, we have formed appetites in our Minds suitable to it.

First, insofar as we are beings who feel immediate pleasures and pains, we can achieve happiness by doing that which ensures our physical preservation here and now. Second, insofar as we are beings interested in longer-term pleasures and pains, we can achieve happiness by doing that which really does bring the most pleasure in the longer term. And because we are able to weigh competing pleasures (we are not a company of insects), we are able to will actions that result in pleasures having true worth. Locke seems to confirm as much here: To him, I say, who hath a prospect of the different state of perfect Happiness or Misery, that attends all Men after this Life, depending on their Behaviour here, the measures of Good and Evil, that govern his choice, are mightily changed. For since nothing of Pleasure and Pain in this Life, can bear any proportion to endless Happiness, or exquisite Misery of an immortal Soul hereafter, Actions in his Power will have their preference, not in according to transient Pleasure, or Pain that accompanies, or follows them here; but as they serve to secure that perfect durable Happiness hereafter.

For all absent good, by which alone barely propos’d, and coming in view, the will is thought to be determin’d, and so to set us on action, being only possible but not infallibly certain, ’tis unavoidable, that the infinitely greater possible good should regularly and constantly determine the will in all the successive actions it directs; and then we should keep constantly and steadily in our course towards Heaven, without ever standing still, or directing our actions to any other end.

From these kinds of experiences, Locke concludes that only the pain generated from not having something we want, that is, a desire for it, causes us to will an action toward the attaining of that perceived good. Therefore, only the pain generated from not having true happiness, namely a desire for it, can move the will to actions attaining it.\n",

Interruption of the ongoing chain of desires in order that the will is redirected to a greater good is referred to as Locke’s “suspension of desire thesis.” It is also necessary for Locke’s second sense of liberty—the freedom to act as the result of rational deliberation.13\n",
            "\n",
            "Liberty, Locke initially defines as “the power a Man has to do or forbear doing any particular Action, according as its doing or forbearance has the actual preference in the Mind, which is the same thing as to say, according, as he himself wills it” (II.xxi.15). This first sense of liberty is the ability to act or not act in accordance with what we will. But if we are motivated by desire, and desires are raised in us proportionate to the uneasiness we feel in any particular moment, and yet we are able to compare and pursue greater goods, then Locke must have an account of how we are able to resist the force of a present desire. Only so are we able to break into the stream of desires in order to assess rationally what we are about to do, that is, have the second sense of liberty. Moreover, our choices are free enough for moral agency because we are able to step back from a present pressing desire in order to examine rationally how much pleasure is to be gained from a particular action as compared with other actions, namely to figure out which action has “true worth”: There being a great many uneasinesses always solliciting, and ready to determine the will, it is natural, as I have said, that the greatest, and most pressing should determine the will to the next action; and so it does for the most part, but not always. For the mind having in most cases, as is evident in Experience, a power to suspend the execution and satisfaction of any of its desires, and so all, one after another, is at liberty to consider the objects of them; examine them on all sides, and weigh them with others. In this lies the liberty a Man has; and from the not using it right comes all that variety of mistakes, errors, and faults which we run into, in the conduct of our lives, and our endeavours after happiness; whilst we precipitate the determination of our wills, and engage too soon before due Examination. To prevent this we have a power to suspend the prosecution of this or that desire, as every one daily may Experiment in himself. This seems to me the source of all liberty; in this seems to consist that, which is (as I think improperly) call’d Free will. For during this suspension of any desire, before the will be determined to action, and the action (which follows that determination) done, we have opportunity to examine, view, and judge, of the good or evil of what we are going to do; and when, upon due Examination, we have judg’d, we have done our duty, all that we can, or ought to do, in pursuit of our happiness; and ’tis not a fault, but a perfection of our nature to desire, will, and act according to the last result of a fair Examination.

Actions in accordance with the law avoid the pain of punishment, either by a civil or a divine authority or by one’s social peers. Moreover, good and evil, as we have seen, “are nothing but Pleasure or Pain, or that which occasions, or procures Pleasure or Pain to us.” Locke then distinguishes “Morally Good and Evil . . . [as] the Conformity or Disagreement of our voluntary Actions to some Law, whereby Good or Evil is drawn on us, for the Will and Power of the law-maker is that we call Reward and Punishment” (II.xxviii.5). Laws, or what Locke also calls “Moral Rules” (II.xxviii.6), come in three sorts with three different kinds of enforcements, or rewards and punishments: “Divine law,” which is enforced by God (II.xxviii.8); “Civil law,” which is enforced by the commonwealth (II.xxviii.9), and the “Law of Opinion or Reputation,” namely the law of virtue and vice, which is enforced by the condemnation, contempt, and disgrace of one’s companions (II.xxviii.10, II.xxviii.12).

Insofar as our choices do not issue from our nature as “thinking, intelligent beings” who naturally desire what they judge best, “the nearer we are,” says Locke, “to Misery and Slavery” (II.xxi.48). That we are able to suspend a desire to act in order to deliberate about the consequences and that the result of the deliberation is the motivation behind what we end up doing are a form of free agency constitutive of the perfection of our nature.\n",

            "It is useful to consider briefly two recent interpretations of the role of suspension and deliberation in Locke’s account of freedom. Yaffe (2000: 58) argues that what grounds a full-fledged sense of liberty, liberty that goes beyond actions in accordance with the will, is that we are strongly tied to the pursuit of the good, a non-agent relative good, such that our choices are determined by that good. Suspension of desire and a rational assessment of the happiness to be achieved in any action are “on occasion, the only way for an agent to bring it about that her volitions are determined by the good.\n",

            "But it is the having of such strong ties that is the ‘foundation of our liberty’ [II.xxi.51]: it is what there is to liberty, true liberty, beyond the freedom of action.” Being “tied” to the good, which Yaffe (2000: 57) also describes as our volitions “tracking the good wherever it lies,” is to choose the right action—the one leading to the most happiness.\n",
            "\n",
            "Moreover, Yaffe (2000: 118) describes this form of liberty as a perfection. He says, “Determination of choice by the good is a perfection in the determination of choice.” I take it that when our choices are determined by the good, we are achieving perfection in our choice-making. Notice, though, that Yaffe is interpreting Locke’s understanding\n",
            "\n",
            "of the perfection attained as one in making the right kinds of choices—choices that attain the good. Yaffe (2000: 118) concludes that true liberty, or freedom, for Locke, is a form of self-transcendence. Because our choices are determined by the good, or at least we have the ability to have them determined by the good, we are able to rise above ourselves by “escaping our own parochialisms and biases.” So, it seems that the perfection of our nature as Locke seems to be describing it above is the making of, or the ability to make, choices that track the good as opposed to those that are perhaps influenced by other considerations.\n",
            "\n",
            "In objection to Yaffe’s interpretation, LoLordo (2012: 53) argues that if God wanted our desires to accord with the good, there are “far more efficient ways to ensure this than by giving us the power to suspend and deliberate.” LoLordo (2012: 51–2) argues against Yaffe’s understanding of free agency as self-transcendence, for it puts too much emphasis on the pursuit of a transcendent good as opposed to our own self-interest. Locke is clear that what we seek is happiness, which is to be achieved by the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. Pleasures and pains are what motivate voluntary action. So suspension of desire is in the service of gaining more pleasure and less pain in the long run, which seems not to be so much self-transcendence as it is self-determination. LoLordo (2012: 53) concludes that the value of suspension and deliberation for Locke’s account of free agency is not that it culminates in choices tied to the good, but rather in that it allows us to determine ourselves: “suspension is valuable because of the way it helps us to modify our desires, not because the desires we end up with after suspending track the good.” As my arguments so far have and will continue to bear out, I suspect it is fairly obvious that I would agree that Locke’s account of moral agency in the second edition of the Essay is more about self-determination than it is about self-transcendence. Indeed, I argue that what is most important about self-determination in moral agency is that it is rational selfdetermination. But I am sympathetic to one very important aspect of Yaffe’s view. I also argue that there is a value of suspension for our perfection, but for me it is the perfection of our nature as intellectual (rational) beings “to desire, will, and act according to the last result of a fair Examination” (II.xxi.47). Achieving that perfection, however, is not tied to transcending my human nature, by having my choices tied to the good, but to the best expression of my nature as an intellectual being in attaining the most pleasure possible— true happiness in the longer term, including in an afterlife.\n",

            "our actions. Reason not only tells us the best way to achieve happiness, but can also raise a desire to will an action proportionate to the assessment of what brings happiness. Locke says, “And therefore every Man is put under a necessity by his constitution, as an intelligent Being, to be determined in willing by his own Thought and Judgment, what is best for him to do” (II.xxi.48).15 But even though a judgment can raise a desire, unless desire is suspended already, we are too taken up with meeting our desires for a second-order judgment about our desires to intervene. That just is why Locke must include the suspension of desire in his account of moral agency—to make enough room for reason to have a role to play.16\n",

Therefore, for Locke’s twofold account of our duty as intelligent agents (the suspension of desire and rational deliberation) to succeed,17 there must be another mechanism by which the will is determined to suspend desire. Our natural innate drive toward happiness (the innate practical principle) is insufficient to motivate the suspension of desire, for, as Locke says, it operates “constantly . . . and influences all our Actions without ceasing” (I.iii.3). Yet clearly we do not always suspend desire in order to deliberate about our actions; we do not always succeed in doing our duty. Suspension of desire, therefore, requires something more.\n",
            "\n",
            "Interpreting Locke’s account of the motivation necessary for suspension requires that we make explicit what Locke, in this next passage, leaves relatively implicit: As therefore the highest perfection of intellectual nature, lies in a careful and constant pursuit of true and solid happiness; so the care of our selves, that we mistake not imaginary for real happiness, is the necessary foundation of our liberty. The stronger ties, we have, to an unalterable pursuit of happiness in general, which is our greatest good, and which as such our desires always follow, the more we are free from any necessary determination of our will to any particular action, and from a necessary compliance with our desire, set upon any particular, and then appearing any preferable good, till we have duly examin’d, whether it has a tendency to, or be inconsistent with our real happiness; and therefore till we are as much inform’d upon this enquiry, as the weight of the matter, and the nature of the case demands, we are by the necessity of preferring and pursuing true happiness as our greatest good, obliged to suspend the satisfaction of our desire in particular cases. (II.xxi.51)\n",
            "\n",
            "Locke’s use of “concernment” in this last sentence, of course, refers to the concern we have for our own true happiness.\n",
            "\n",
            "The difficulty and importance of this passage warrant a careful look. Locke tells us that the highest perfection of our intellectual nature “lies in a careful and constant pursuit of true happiness.” From previous passages, we know that pursuit of “real” or “true” happiness is the pursuit of long-term happiness ending ultimately in eternal happiness in an afterlife. In the consideration of any particular good we can make sure that that good is consistent with gaining true happiness.18 Moreover, Locke says that part of our natural pursuit of true happiness is the “care of ourselves” that we mistake not imaginary for real happiness, and this is the “necessary foundation of our liberty.” I take Locke to mean that we have a natural concern for ourselves that we attain true happiness.19 Not to mistake apparent for true happiness is to avoid a determination of the will to an action that we have not yet assessed insofar as it actually does bring true happiness. Therefore, the natural concern for our own true happiness is essential to the suspension of desire. Furthermore, in glossing the “care of our selves” that we pursue true happiness, Locke explains that the “stronger our ties” to the pursuit of “happiness in general, which is our greatest good . . . the more we are free from any necessary determination of our will to any particular action.” Here, Locke explains that the greater our concern for our happiness generally, the greater the impulse toward rational deliberation, and so the freer we are from necessary determination by any particular desire. Constitutive of the highest perfection of an intellectual nature, therefore, is a natural concern for ourselves that the happiness to which we are innately driven is true as opposed to merely apparent happiness. That Locke sees the innate practical principle (the desire for happiness generally) as insufficient on its own for suspension is further confirmed in this passage: But though this general Desire of Happiness operates constantly and invariably, yet the satisfaction of any particular desire can be suspended from determining the will to any subservient action, till we have maturely examin’d, whether the particular apparent good, which we then desire, makes a part of our real Happiness, or be consistent or inconsistent with it.

            "general desire for happiness is required to resist the force of a particular desire. For surely Locke realizes that he cannot have it both ways.

            "Then, in this next passage, Locke ties our concern for true happiness to our ability to suspend desire. Indeed, our concern that we attain true happiness leads to the suspension of desire and rational deliberation: This is the hinge on which turns the liberty of intellectual beings in their constant endeavours after, and a steady prosecution of true felicity, that they can suspend this prosecution in particular cases, till they have looked before them, and informed themselves, whether that particular thing, which is then proposed, or desired, lie in the way to their main end, and make a real part of that which is their greatest good. For the inclination and tendency of their nature to happiness is an obligation, and motive to them, to take care not to miss it; and so necessarily puts them on caution, deliberation, and wariness, in the direction of their particular actions, which are the means to obtain it. Whatever necessity determines to the pursuit of real Bliss, the same necessity, with the same force establishes suspence, deliberation, and scrutiny of each successive desire, whether the satisfaction of it, does not interfere with our true happiness, and mislead us from it.

It can be no other than eternal bliss, the eternal happiness of an afterlife.21 And even though we have a natural inclination to our own happiness generally, which gives us an “obligation” and a “motive” to attain happiness by the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain, still we have to “take care” that we do not miss an opportunity for true happiness.22 I read Locke’s use of “to take care” in making sure that whatever pleasure we are driven toward makes a part of our “real” happiness as equivalent to having a “concern for true happiness.” That is, if I am taking care not to miss an opportunity for true happiness when I am confronted with a particular desire, then I must be concerned that whatever appears as bringing happiness really and truly does bring happiness—in the longer term. Locke then adds, “Whatever necessity determines to the pursuit of real Bliss, the same necessity, with the same force establishes suspence, deliberation, and scrutiny of each successive desire” (II.xxi.52). Locke says much the same thing in II.xxi.51: “we\n",
            "\n",
            "are by the necessity of preferring and pursuing true happiness as our greatest good, obliged to suspend the satisfaction of our desire in particular cases.” Locke seems to be distinguishing true happiness from happiness generally. And whatever drives us to true as opposed to happiness generally is what also drives us to suspend desire.\n",
            "\n",
            "So even though we are always driven toward our happiness generally—toward pleasure and away from pain—it is something more, an additional concern, or motivation, that puts us in the direction of true happiness. Since it is the same force that moves us to true happiness (real Bliss) as moves us to suspend desire and deliberate about our actions, Locke must mean that the concern we have that the happiness we achieve is true happiness, or true felicity, is necessary to the suspension of desire. And the greater our concern for true happiness, that is, the greater our concern that whatever we are naturally driven toward leads to true happiness, the more we succeed in suspending a particular desire to assess its potential for true happiness.\n",
            "\n",
            "What is more, because the alleviation of any pain results in pleasure, the concern to attain the most pleasure possible (true happiness) leads to the possibility of pursuing something that brings more pleasure, namely to the suspension of desire, regardless of whether after we have suspended desire we end up choosing what in fact promises the most pleasure. To sum up, insofar as we are beings with an intellectual nature, there is a natural concern for ourselves that reason is given its proper role to play in determining action even if the results of a rational deliberation are not without error. Suspension of desire creates the space for rational deliberation to occur. Working in tandem with our natural drive to happiness generally (the innate natural tendency to pleasure and away from pain imprinted in us from birth (I.iii.3)), is the additional concern for ourselves that we attain the kind (and degree) of happiness suitable to an intellectual nature—true happiness. Only when this additional concern for ourselves triggers the will to suspend desire are we in the right position to achieve our natural perfection.\n",
            "\n",
            "Note that I am interpreting Locke’s use of “concern” here in a somewhat technical sense. When it is found in conjunction with happiness, Locke sometimes seems to have given it a more precise meaning: “concern” denotes a natural motivation toward true happiness, namely the uneasiness or pain of its absence. Let me draw attention to one passage where Locke seems explicitly to understand “concern” as equivalent to motivation. In II.xxi.43, when explaining that we can acknowledge a good without having a desire to pursue it, he says the following: Thus, how much soever Men are in earnest, and constant in pursuit of happiness; yet they may have a clear view of good, great and confessed good, without being concern’d for it, or moved by it, if they think they can make up their happiness without it. Though, as to pain, that they are always concern’d for; they can feel no uneasiness without being moved. (II.xxi.43) Here, Locke uses an appositive “or” to express that being “concern’d for” a good is the same as being “moved by it.” I take Locke to mean that I am concerned for, or moved by the pain or uneasiness of something’s absence. Moreover, we can fail to be\n",
            "\n",
            "concerned to pursue something that is not perceived as contributing to our happiness, but we cannot fail to be concerned for (or moved by) something that causes pain. Any pain (or uneasiness) automatically, as the result of the way we are naturally constructed, generates a desire; we are moved to alleviate it. Given all the previous arguments in addition to this passage, there is good justification for concluding that Locke sees concern for ourselves that we attain true happiness (the pain of not having it) as having motivational force.23\n",
            "\n",
            "It is, of course, true that when Locke uses the term “concern” or “concernment” in the Essay it does not always carry this more technical meaning, and in these cases it is not meant to designate a motivation to suspend desire. This might be a good reason why Strawson (2011) interprets Locke’s use of concern in every case as merely having interests.24 One distinction I think we can make, though, is between interests for which it makes sense to be concerned about the true as opposed to the apparent happiness to be gained. For example, we find Locke using “concern” and “concernment” quite a lot in his II.xxvii chapter on personal identity. In II.xxvii.25, he tells us that “every intelligent being, sensible of Happiness and Misery, must grant, that there is something that is himself, that he is concerned for, and would have happy.” In II.xxvii.16, he says, “I being as much concern’d and as justly accountable for any Action was done a thousand Years since, appropriated to me now by this self-consciousness, as I am, for what I did in the last moment.”25 In the first passage, I am concerned for myself merely insofar as I suffer pleasures and pains; in the second, I am concerned for myself insofar as I am accountable for past actions. We see the same thing in Locke’s use of “concern” in his remarks about the certainty of sensitive knowledge (IV.ii.14, IV.xi.8). There he assures us that our degree of certainty is sufficient for our concerns, for our practical needs.\n",
            "\n",
            "In each of the above cases, my happiness does not at all depend on drawing a distinction between true and apparent happiness. For example, I need not be worried that I cannot know whether a global skeptical scenario obtains, for as I have argued, I will feel the same pains or pleasures as the result of my sensory experiences regardless of whether or not they are actually produced by really existing external objects. In the II.xxvii.16 example from the chapter on personal identity, my concern is for myself insofar as I must suffer the consequences of an action I have already committed and so a rational assessment of its true value is pointless. I will suffer whatever happiness or misery comes with having done the action.26 But when I have\n",
            "\n",
            "a present desire driving a future action, my happiness is dependent on drawing that distinction. The difference here is that reason can play a role in whether or not I attain true happiness. But for reason to be effective, we must be able to suspend desire. So it makes sense that Locke’s use of “concern” for true happiness with respect to motivating suspension is different from his use of it in other places. Locke sees concern for ourselves that we attain true happiness as responsible for moving the will to suspend desire so that reason plays its proper role in determining our actions.27\n",
            "\n",
            "We now have very good reasons to draw the following two conclusions. First, when it comes to the true happiness to be gained from future actions, Locke seems to be using “concern” more technically to refer to a natural motivation resulting in the suspension of desire. That concern for true happiness plays this role in Locke’s account of moral motivation answers an important question. If the natural inclination to happiness is constantly operative, then why do we sometimes fail to suspend our desires? Although the innate inclination to happiness may give us a reason and a motive to suspend, there is more to the motivational story for beings capable of rational, and, so also, moral agency. The concern for our own true happiness—a natural motivation toward the perfection of our nature as intellectual beings—is also operative. It provides the additional motivation making sure that reason plays the role it is supposed to play in our natural pursuit of happiness. One can, of course, still ask why we do not suspend all of the time, namely why we fail to suspend desire and why some people succeed in suspending more often than others? I will address these questions in the next section.\n",
            "\n",
            "Second, just as we are naturally interrupted by the pain of not having what we need (food and water) to ensure our physical preservation here and now, we are naturally interrupted by the pain of not having what we need (suspension of desire and rationally informed choices) to ensure our long-term preservation in this life and, perhaps, even in an afterlife. Insofar as we are beings capable of pleasure and pain, we have a constant and abiding natural inclination toward pleasure and away from pain: We are moved toward our happiness generally. Insofar as we are beings capable of rational deliberation, we have an additional capacity—a natural concern to make sure that the pleasures and pains we pursue and avoid contribute to our true (long-term) happiness. The effect of this latter motivation is the ability to suspend desire so that the perfection of an intellectual nature—the rational consideration of an action insofar as it promises true happiness—is achieved. Having a natural concern for ourselves that our happiness is true happiness, therefore, underwrites Locke’s account of the liberty necessary for moral agency.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the next section, we will see that the concern for ourselves that we attain true happiness, which grounds the liberty constitutive of moral agency, is linked to the fact that we are self-conscious beings.\n",

            "## 5.4 Consciousness and the Concern for Happiness Locke himself links consciousness to the concern we have for our own happiness in the II.xxvii chapter, On Identity and Diversity. On the nature of the self, he says: Self is that conscious thinking thing, (whatever Substance, made up of whether Spiritual, or Material, Simple, or Compounded it matters not) which is sensible of Pleasure and Pain, capable of Happiness or Misery, and so is concern’d for it self, as far as that consciousness extends.

            "Selves, or persons, for Locke, are not only able to feel pleasure and pain, but also they are capable of happiness and misery. But to be concerned for myself insofar as I am apt to feel pleasure and pain and am capable of happiness and misery requires that I have consciousness. It is not enough that I am a creature that senses pleasure and pain; I must also be aware of my pleasure and pain. Pleasures, pains, happiness, and misery would be nothing to me, were I not conscious of it. Locke confirms as much when he says, “For to be happy or miserable without being conscious of it, seems to me utterly inconsistent and impossible” (II.i.11). Saying that I am happy or miserable if I am unable to experience happiness or misery is nonsensical.\n",
            "\n",
            "Moreover, concern for happiness is not just due to the awareness of pleasure and pain—the capacity actually to feel pleasure and pain—but also that the pleasure and pain is experienced by me. Locke says: For as to this point of being the same self, it matters not whether this present self be made up of the same or other Substances, I being as much concern’d, . . . for any Action that was done a thousand years since, appropriated to me now by this self-consciousness, as I am, for what I did the last moment.

I cannot feel another’s pain, so I am not concerned about another’s pain, at least not in the same way. Therefore, insofar as there is a natural connection between consciousness and the concern we have for any happiness, it must be a connection between selfconsciousness and the concern for happiness. It is a concern for myself insofar as I am a being that experiences pleasure and pain.\n",

            "Perhaps the clearest connection Locke makes between consciousness and a concern for happiness is in his II.xxvii.26 definition of ‘person’:29 It is a Forensick Term appropriating Actions and their Merit; and so belongs only to intelligent Agents capable of a Law, and Happiness and Misery. This personality extends it self beyond present Existence to what is past, only by consciousness, whereby it becomes concerned and accountable, owns and imputes to it self past Actions, just upon the same ground, and for the same reason, that it does the present.

            "Because consciousness can “extend itself beyond its present Existence,” that is, we are able to be aware of past, present, and future actions as our own, we can be aware of the pleasures and pains they will bring. As already argued, when it comes to past actions, for which we no longer have any control over the happiness and misery we will suffer for having done them, we are concerned for ourselves insofar as we will experience that pleasure and pain. But when it comes to future actions, our concern for ourselves takes on a different dimension; we are naturally concerned to do that which actually does bring pleasure rather than pain. We are moved toward the true or long-term happiness suitable to a being with an intellectual nature. Although Locke does not make this distinction explicitly in the passage above, I think we can see it there implicitly. Insofar as we are beings who experience pleasure and pain, we have a natural innate drive to pleasure and away from pain. But insofar as we are intelligent agents capable of a law and true happiness and misery, we are capable of an additional concern that the pleasures and pains we will experience as the result of our own agency are consistent with the kind of happiness suitable to the kind of beings we are. Because we are rational (intellectual) beings who can look to the future,30 we can be naturally moved to suspend desire in order to allow reason its role in attaining our natural perfection. The link between consciousness and concern is a part of that perfection.\n",

            "Moreover, that we are rational beings conscious of pleasure and pain and so concerned about our true happiness answers another important consideration in Locke’s account of moral agency. Given that, as I interpret him, Locke has a causal theory of agency, it is reasonable to ask why we should think there is any real agency at all. Yaffe (2000: 121–2) puts it this way: [C]ausal theories of agency build doings out of happenings and causal relations. . . . The problem all causal theories face—or rather the obstacle they must overcome—might be called the Where’s the Agent Problem. . . . In general, no matter what the concept of agency we are trying to understand—whether it is action in general or intentional action, or autonomous action—if we analyze it as an event caused in some particular way by events and states of an\n",

            "\n",
            "Yaffe argues that suitable agency is found in Locke’s linking of consciousness to our choices (volitions or acts of the will). On Yaffe’s (2000: 120, 126) view, which includes features similar to an appropriation-like interpretation of personal identity in Locke, consciousness (or those thoughts and actions we are conscious of) sets the boundaries of a particular person.31 Moreover, our choices are necessarily internal to us.\n",
            "\n",
            "Choices are essentially internal to us as persons, because were we not conscious of them, they would not count as choices at all. So insofar as we are conscious of our choices, there is a connection between a feature of us as persons (consciousness) and something essentially internal to us leading to action (a choice, or volition).\n",
            "\n",
            "Unfortunately, though, as Yaffe realizes and confronts, this link between us as persons and our choices is not enough, for it is merely correlation; consciousness does not play a role itself in the production of the action, and so is not enough to locate a source of agency. Rather, according to Yaffe (2000: 130), “we want our choices not merely to be essentially internal to ourselves; we also want the fact of their internality to account for their causal role.” We want the feature of us as persons to be linked to the cause of a particular choice, or volition—to what moves the will. That can be achieved, he argues, by focusing on the relation between consciousness and pleasure and pain. Yaffe turns to Locke’s II.i.11 claim, cited earlier, that it makes no sense that we can have pleasure and pain and not be conscious of it. But notice that he (2000: 133) emphasizes that Locke is making a conceptual point: [T]he very idea of having a pain without feeling it is “impossible” and “inconsistent.” In this respect, pains and pleasure are for Locke like choices: a modification of an agent cannot possibly count as a pain or a pleasure unless the agent is “conscious” of it.\n",
            "\n",
            "This allows Yaffe (2000: 133) to draw the following conclusion: As uneasinesses are pains, and pains always involve “consciousness,” and “consciousness” is constitutive of personal identity, to say that an agent’s volitions are caused by her uneasinesses is to say that they are caused by a state that is essentially internal to her qua person, for a state of an agent of which she is not “conscious” cannot possibly count as a pain.\n",
            "\n",
            "Yaffe has established the link he sought between consciousness (the boundaries of personal identity) and the cause of an act of the will. Because consciousness is necessary for uneasiness to count as uneasiness and uneasiness causes volition, we can say that there is an internal state of a person qua person (consciousness of an uneasiness) causing the volition. Our choices can be said to come from us as persons.\n",

            "I am sympathetic to much of Yaffe’s solution to the problem of establishing sufficient agency in Locke’s causal theory of action. I worry, though, that the agency found is insufficient for free and so moral agency. That is, to tie consciousness to uneasiness does not distinguish the kind of agency we would see in animals from what we would find in persons, for as we have seen, Locke is clearly committed to the view that animals (human and non-human) are conscious. Because all thinking is conscious, and, for Locke, animals think (have perception), animals are conscious.32\n",

            "Fortunately, my account provides exactly what we are looking for. The internal connection we are seeking between a being insofar as she is a person (or a state of a being qua person) and her choices is the concern for true happiness—that what we desire really does bring happiness as opposed to misery in the longer term. For ease, let me repeat Locke’s II.xxvii definition of a person: It is a Forensick Term appropriating Actions and their Merit; and so belongs only to intelligent Agents capable of a Law, and Happiness and Misery. This personality extends it self beyond present Existence to what is past, only by consciousness, whereby it becomes concerned and accountable, owns and imputes to it self past Actions, just upon the same ground, and for the same reason, that it does the present.

But this just is to be a being with an intellectual nature, the “highest perfection” of which “lies in a careful and constant pursuit of true and solid happiness” (II.xxi.51). Moral agency, the agency suitable to a being with an intellectual nature, then, is grounded in the suspension of desire and the rational assessment of potential actions as they compare to laws and so promise either happiness or misery—long-term happiness or misery. I suggest that because we are beings with an intellectual nature conscious of pleasure and pain who are naturally concerned about their own true happiness, we are sufficiently connected to our choices/volitions to answer the “Where’s the agent problem.” The connection we are seeking, between a state internal to us insofar as we are persons and a choice that establishes moral agency, is not between consciousness and an act of the will, but between the concern we have for our own true happiness and an act of the will.

Insofar as we are beings with an intellectual nature, our concern for our own true happiness (an uneasiness) connects who we are as persons, as moral agents, namely beings able to suspend desire and deliberate about which actions are sanctioned by law, with a particular choice and so with a particular action. So, I (qua person, qua moral agent) am the cause of my choice to perform a particular action.

The answer lies in the role of education and habituation in developing a more rational nature. In Some Thoughts Concerning Education, after having provided advice about how best to care for the body, Locke moves to the care of the mind: Due care being had to keep the body in strength and vigor so that it may be able to obey and execute the orders of the mind, the next principle business is to set the mind right, that on all occasions it may be disposed to consent to nothing but what may be suitable to the dignity and excellency of a rational creature.

This power is to be got and improved by custom, made easy and familiar by an early practice. (Locke 1996/1693: 29)\n",

This temper, therefore, so contrary to unguided nature, is to be got betimes; and this habit, as the true foundation of future ability and happiness, is to be wrought into the mind as early as may be.

Locke is clear that young children lack ideas of reflection (II.i.8), which suggests they also lack other complex abilities of the understanding, say, the ability to make rational judgments about what conduces to longterm happiness. Locke says as much when he contrasts the difference in parenting a younger as opposed to a grown child: “For liberty and indulgence can do no good to children: their want of judgment makes them stand in need of restraint and discipline” (Locke 1996/1693: 31). Because young children cannot make moral judgments, they must be constrained to act properly. Contrast this approach with his advice concerning a parent’s relation to a much older child. “We must look upon our children, when grown up, to be like ourselves: with the same passions, the same desires. We would be thought rational creatures, and have our freedom” (Locke 1996/1693: 31).

In Of the Conduct of the Understanding, Locke (1996/1706: 173) reiterates his view: “We are born with faculties and powers capable of almost anything, such at least as would carry us farther than can easily be imagined: but it is only the exercise of those powers which gives us ability and skill in anything, and leads us towards perfection,” and a little later he says, “the faculties of our souls are improved and made useful to us just after the same manner as our bodies are . . . ; we are born to be if we please, rational creatures, but it is use and exercise only that makes us so.” Through exercise and practice our capacity to suspend desire and engage in good reasoning (and so also virtuous conduct) is transformed into a natural skill.\n",

Not to expect at least that of an adult rational being is tantamount to “leveling them with the brutes, and charging them with a stupidity below the rank of a rational creature” (Locke 1996/1706: 182). There is, however, one duty to education we all have: “Besides his particular calling for the support of this life, everyone has a concern in a future life, which he is bound to look after. This engages his thoughts in religion; and here it mightily lies upon him to understand and reason right” (Locke 1996/1706: 182).\n",

            "Locke continues that the best way to fit the mind to the kind of education offered by religion is to “fill it with moral and more abstract ideas” (Locke 1996/1706: 183). I take Locke’s point to be this. Because we have an innate drive to happiness and a capacity both to consider our future actions as ours and to care about what the future brings, we have an obligation as rational beings to do all that we must do to ensure that that future is a good one, namely one with true happiness. Thus, we should gain knowledge of religion, which tells us what kind of future awaits us and how best to achieve it, namely by making sure our actions are commensurate with divine law. Of course, this does not mean that only those steeped in religion can be concerned for and achieve longer-term happiness. For we should also gain knowledge of civil laws and laws of reputation so that our actions are commensurate with those and so avoid associated punishments.33\n",

            "\n",
            "What we find in Locke, I suggest, is a sort of natural feedback loop. Our natural constitution (the innate drive to pleasure and away from pain and consciousness of pleasure and pain) leads us to seek that which brings pleasure and avoids pain. But once we gain the ability to determine the difference between apparent and true happiness, which is then aided by experience and education, we come to be naturally moved to seek that which is more suitable to the beings we have become—beings who can exercise an intellectual nature. Now not only are we driven toward pleasure and away from pain, but also we are concerned that what we are driven toward is true as opposed to apparent happiness. Were we still unable to deliberate about our actions, the concern for true happiness would be pointless, and even frustrating. That is why young children not yet able to distinguish apparent from true happiness—or shortfrom long-term happiness—have no concern for the latter over the former. But once we gain the ability to distinguish immediate from longer-term pleasures and to use our reason to attain the latter instead of the former, we trigger in ourselves a natural concern that we achieve all we can, insofar as we are the kind of beings we are. This, of course, leads us to seek education, to learn what brings the most pleasure and avoids the most pain. In turn, greater education results in even more concern to attain the long-term happiness we have learned is open to us and so naturally moves the will more regularly to suspend desire so that we are successful. The more we understand our possibilities for the future and the way to attain them, the greater is our concern for that future (true) happiness, and thus the greater and more regular is the force exerted on the will to suspend a particular desire in order rationally to assess its promise of true happiness.\n",
            "\n",
            "Therefore, and at the threat of repetition, insofar as we are beings capable of pleasure and pain, we have a natural drive to pleasure and away from pain. Insofar as we become intellectual beings capable on our own of assessing the true value of what we are driven toward, we become concerned that we are attaining all that is out there for us. Our natural concern for true happiness gains in intensity—the mind is strengthened—through education and experience. In this way, we become better and better at suspending desire in order to deliberate about what we want to do.\n",

            "\n",
            "suspend desire and think about the consequences of our choices in order to avoid, even unknowingly, acting immorally. So although religious education will inform us about what true happiness ultimately consists in, and formal education will inform us of the laws we should abide, coming to understand and employ our own rational capacities in the service of pleasure is all that is needed to trigger a natural concern that we think about what we do in order to ensure more happiness in the longer term.\n",
            "\n",
            "And in so doing we achieve the kind, and are on our way to achieving the degree, of happiness meant for us. I suppose it is also possible that one is born finding pleasure only in what is also commensurate with law, so that neither suspension nor deliberation is necessary to attaining true happiness. But given that pleasure is often tied to self-interest, for Locke, as well as his great concern with how to educate children to be more rational (and virtuous), it is doubtful that he would think there are such persons. Indeed, Locke thinks that it is the “superior Beings above us . . . that . . . are more steadily determined in their choice of Good than we” (II.xxi.49).\n",

            "Similarly, against the objection that it is not a very robust sense of liberty to be naturally moved to choose whatever action results from a deliberation about what is best for one to do, Locke argues that it would be evidence of madness to want it any other way: If to break loose from the conduct of Reason, and to want that restraint of Examination and Judgment, which keeps us from chusing or doing the worse, be Liberty, true Liberty, mad Men and Fools are the only Freemen: But yet, I think, no Body would chuse to be mad for the sake of such Liberty, but he that is mad already.

            "One would be mad, or at a least a fool, not to want one’s actions to be guided by reason. And were it the case that our actions were not guided by reason, Locke questions whether we are indeed intellectual beings. He considers whether “any one be a Changeling, because he is less determined, by wise Considerations, than a wise Man” (II.xxi.50). The point, I take it, is that it is a perfection of an intellectual nature to be guided by reason, and that were one not so vulnerable to the result of a rational deliberation, one might not have an intellectual nature at all. Therefore, insofar as we are intellectual beings, we have a power to suspend a particular desire in order to let reason play its natural role in our pursuit of happiness. And once we are able to employ our reason to figure out what we most want, we gain a natural concern for our own true happiness, which, if strong enough, activates that power of suspension.\n",

            "## 5.5 The Unity of Consciousness and Moral Motivation In chapter four, I provided a textual argument that Locke uses “consciousness” ambiguously in II.xxvii to mean (1) a mental state in which we are aware of ourselves as thinking and (2) the ongoing self we aware of in that mental state. I then concentrated primarily on establishing (2), that Locke’s theory of personal identity includes a metaphysical fact of an ongoing self, a continuing consciousness. But also important to Locke’s “forensic” account of persons (that persons are “intelligent Agents capable of a Law, and Happiness and Misery” (II.xxvii.26)) is that we are able to experience ourselves as ongoing—as temporal beings. That is, the metaphysical fact of a continuing consciousness is revealed to us as a phenomenological fact of ourselves as extending into the past and into the future. Locke’s account of moral agency can be seen to rely on this phenomenological fact in that we must be able to experience a past self to take responsibility for what we did, and we must be able to experience a future self in order to be concerned for the true happiness and misery that may come our way. In this section, we will see how pre-reflective consciousness constituent in every mental act provides such an experience necessary for moral motivation.\n",

            "Locke’s account of moral agency includes that we experience ourselves as temporal beings. As we saw in his version of the cogito argument, Locke is clear that we are conscious of our own synchronic existence whenever we perceive an idea: “In every Act of Sensation, Reasoning, and Thinking, we are conscious to our selves of our own Being; and, in this Matter, come not short of the highest degree of Certainty” (IV.ix.3). But also, as we know from his account of personal identity in II.xxvii., being a person requires that we also have a diachronic experience of ourselves: This being premised to find wherein personal identity consists, we must consider what Person stands for; which, I think, is a thinking intelligent Being, that has reason and reflection, and can consider it self as it self, that same thinking thing in different times and places; which it does only by that consciousness, which is inseparable from thinking, and it seems to me essential to it. (II.xxvii.9)\n",
            "\n",
            "Consciousness allows for an experience of our own diachronic unity, because we are conscious of ourselves as the same self in different perceptions of ideas. In chapter four, I gave a promissory note to explain how we achieve unity of consciousness. It is time now to cash it in. As we saw only briefly in chapter four, Locke argues that consciousness provides for the experience of ourselves as extending into the past.\n",
            "\n",
            "Consciousness, Locke says, “joins” thoughts and actions to a single self: That with which the consciousness of this present thinking thing can join it self, makes the same Person, and is one self with it, and with nothing else; and so attributes to it self, and owns all the Actions of that thing, as its own, as far as that consciousness reaches, and no farther; as everyone who reflects will perceive. (II.xxvii.17)35 That we experience the same self in different thoughts (and actions) allows for the “joining,” or unifying, of conscious states. In other words, the consciousness of each mental state provides an experience of the self, and the consciousness of successive mental states provides an experience of a unified self.36 Consider these two passages: [Y]et ’tis plain consciousness, as far as ever it can be extended, should it be to Ages past, unites Existences, and Actions, very remote in time, into the same Person, as well as it does the Existence and Actions of the immediately preceding moment.

In both cases, I experience myself as the same self in a continuous stream of thinking—as temporally extended.38\n",

            "already cited, we see this intimate relation between consciousness and thinking or willing also in the following: And therefore how far the consciousness of past Actions is annexed to any individual Agent, so that another cannot possibly have it, will be hard for us to determine, till we know what kind of Action it is, that cannot be done without a reflex Act of Perception accompanying it. (II.xxvii.13)\n",
            "\n",
            "Reflexively, consciousness provides for the awareness of the thought or action as specifically belonging to me—the “I” thinking—such that it does not belong to another. The “reflex Act of Perception” (consciousness)39 accompanying a thought or action provides it with a unique first-personal character—a character of mine-ness or for-me-ness. Thus, Locke claims that I cannot know whether anyone else can have my experience of myself as thinking until I know whether what makes the thinking particularly mine—its first-personal character—can be separated from the thinking itself.40 Once we see that the first-personal character of consciousness is essential to experiencing any single perception as mine, it is easier to see how consecutive perceptions of ideas, whether temporally contiguous or not, can be experienced as temporally unified. That is, Locke clearly thinks we experience ourselves as diachronically unified and that the first-personal character of consciousness constituent in every mental act provides that experience.\n",
            "\n",
            "How should we see our experience of ourselves as unified in consciousness? As we already know, Locke maintains that we have ideas in the mind simultaneously. The composition of complex ideas of substances requires that we have several simple ideas in the mind at the same time, as does reflecting on the perception of an idea and perceiving a relation between ideas.41 If ideas are perceived in the mind simultaneously, then we are also conscious of ourselves as perceiving those ideas. Consider, first, an example in which we have knowledge in virtue of perceiving an agreement involving simultaneous ideas. “Thus the Mind,” Locke says, “perceives that White is not Black, that a Circle is not a Triangle, That Three are more than Two, and equal to One and Two. Such kind of truths the Mind perceives at the first sight of the Ideas together” (IV.ii.1). To take just one of these examples, I am conscious I am perceiving an idea of the number three and I am conscious I am perceiving an idea of the number two. But my experience in being conscious that I am perceiving an agreement of ideas seems to be that I am conscious of the same self as perceiving both ideas. Because both perceptions have the same firstpersonal character, I experience the two perceptions of ideas as held together by one consciousness. Resulting is a complex conscious state of myself as knowing intuitively that three is more than two. The experience of the unity of consciousness is such that\n",
            "\n",
            "there can be one and the same consciousness linking two perceptions of ideas in a proposition known to be true.42\n",
            "\n",
            "That we experience the unity of consciousness is also evident in cases where we engage in demonstrative reasoning. But here we have an experience of unity of consciousness in successive contiguous perceptions of ideas. For example, first there is a perception of the idea ‘P!Q’ followed by the perception of the idea ‘P.’ It seems that in order to intuit ‘Q’ the perception of the idea ‘P’ must be brought into contemporaneity with the perception of the idea ‘P!Q.’ Perceptions of ideas would, in a sense, overlap one another in my consciousness in something more like an extended present.43 This can be achieved if thinking is temporally extended in the sense that one idea can remain in the mind while another idea is perceived. In this kind of case, perceptions of ideas are united or gathered together in consciousness, perhaps we should say “joined,” such that I am conscious of myself as temporally extended through these successive perceptions of ideas. Locke does not specifically describe the perception of a demonstrative agreement as the result of reasoning as temporally extended. But he does suggest something like it in his description of how we employ intervening ideas in a demonstration: The Reason why the Mind cannot always perceive presently the Agreement or Disagreement of two Ideas is, because those Ideas, concerning whose Agreement or Disagreement the Enquiry is made, cannot by the Mind be so put together, as to shew it. In this Case then, when the Mind cannot so bring its Ideas together, as by their immediate Comparison, and as it were Juxtaposition, or application one to another, to perceive their Agreement or Disagreement, it is fain, by the Intervention of other Ideas (one or more, as it happens) to discover the Agreement or Disagreement, which it searches; and this is that which we call Reasoning. (IV.ii.2)\n",
            "\n",
            "Locke seems to be saying that the intervening idea needed to show the agreement is brought into contemporaneity with the ideas already in the mind, which allows for the perception of agreement between the previously juxtaposed ideas.

            "\n",
            "something like an extended or continuing present.

            "\n",
            "As was mentioned briefly in the last chapter, we see the same sort of thing happening in reflection, in particular on a past thought, as the perceptual situation in which consciousness is “extended backwards” in the appropriation of a past action. When I currently reflect on a perception of a past thought or action, I have in my mind simultaneously two different perceptions of ideas. I have the present reflection and I have the revived idea that is the object of the reflection. Internal to both perceptions is the consciousness of myself, in the one case as reflecting and in the other case as remembering. If there is the same internal experience of myself—the same first-personal character—as both reflecting and remembering, then there is a unified experience of myself as perceiving from the past to the present, which can be expressed by saying I am conscious of myself as perceiving an idea I had before.45 Thus, I have a unified experience of being conscious of two perceptions of ideas as opposed to an experience that would be described (implausibly) as including two perceptions of ideas with two consciousnesses.\n",
            "\n",
            "Moreover, when I have this kind of unified experience of myself as thinking in both the past and the present, I have the experience of my consciousness as “reaching” or “extending” into the past. Similar arguments can be given for cases of reflection that do not involve memories. Remember also that Locke defines a person as a “thinking intelligent Being, that has reason and reflection” (II.xxvii.9). Moreover, as we have just seen, reflection is one way—most explicitly when we reflect on memory—in which the continued existence of a person is made present to herself. Because of reflection, I can be conscious of myself, or my person, as something that exists diachronically.46\n",

            "\n",
            "Again, reconstructing Locke’s view in this way bears remarkable similarity to more recent work in the phenomenology of consciousness. Here is Zahavi’s (2011: 329) description of how the “first-personal character” of successive perceptions of ideas allows for the experience of the unity of consciousness: The self doesn’t actively unite disparate bits of experience, nor is the self an extra element that must be added to the stream of consciousness in order to ensure its unification. The point is rather that all experiences that share the same primary presence or first-personal character are mine. To put it differently, experiential (diachronic and synchronic) unity is constituted by first personal character.\n",
            "\n",
            "The self does not actively unify thinking; rather, that all thinking has internal to it the same first-personal character ensures that we experience the same self as thinking in a continuous stream.47\n",
            "\n",
            "Alternatively, consider what Locke thinks happens when there is no sameness of first-personal character, namely when consciousnesses are experienced as unrelated: For it is evident in the instance I gave just now, if the consciousness went along with the little Finger, when it was cut off, that would be the same self which was concerned for the whole Body Yesterday, as making a part of it self, whose Actions then it cannot but admit as it own now. Though if the same Body should still live, and immediately from that separation of the little Finger have its own peculiar consciousness, whereof the little Finger knew nothing, it would not be at all concerned in it, as a part of it self, or could own any of its Actions, or have any of them imputed to him. (II.xxvii.16)\n",
            "\n",
            "In this case, someone’s consciousness is located in the little finger and then severed from the rest of the body. Subsequently, a different “peculiar” consciousness inhabits the body. On my interpretation, consciousness provides the first-personal character of thinking. So when it is in the finger, I would experience myself as being concerned about the finger, but I would not experience myself as concerned about the body.\n",
            "\n",
            "Consider Zahavi’s (2005: 132) explanation of the experience of ourselves in remembering: “To determine whether a past experience is mine, I do not first need to assure myself of the uninterrupted, temporal continuity between my present recollection and the past experience. If I have first-personal access to the past experience, it is automatically given as my past experience. There is more to episodic memory than the retrieval of information from the past. The subjective experience of remembering involves the conviction that the remembered episode was once experienced by me.” Moreover, like Zahavi’s description, were reflection needed to experience the unity of consciousness, then we would also have other ideas generated, which Locke does not include in his discussion of the unity of consciousness. For example, were I to reflect specifically on a succession of ideas, there would be generated an idea of succession and then of duration: “’Tis evident to any one who will but observe what passes in his own Mind, that there is a train of Ideas, which constantly succeed one another in his Understanding, as long as he is awake. Reflection on these appearances of several Ideas one after another in our Minds, is that which furnishes us with an Idea of Succession: And the distance between any parts of that Succession, or between the appearance of any two Ideas in our Minds, is that we call Duration” (II.xiv.3). Thus, the unity of consciousness is achieved by virtue of pre-reflective consciousness constituent of every mental state and not by either an idea of the self or the contiguity of mental states themselves.\n",
            "\n",
            "Similarly, were each perception of an idea to have its own “peculiar consciousness” (as analogous to the example of the finger and the body), there would be no experience of the unity of thinking, no experience of the same self, the same I, in different perceptions of ideas, say, the same my self that celebrated her twenty-first birthday or just wrote the previous sentence. And importantly for Locke, were there no sense that past selves are identical to me and so their actions belong to me, there would be no attitude of concern (in the non-technical sense) for what I have done or that I might be punished for it. I would have no reason to care that what I have done turns out well for me instead of badly. Without such an experience of the unity of consciousness, our past actions would be of no more concern to us than if they had been done by someone else. Because we are conscious of our past actions as ours, we can be held accountable for the rewards and punishments (pleasures and pains) they bring.48 Likewise, I suggest, we must be able to identify with a future self in order to generate any concern (in the technical sense) about the pleasures and pains promised by a future action. Were I not to experience a future action as mine, I would have no concern that the pleasure it promises leads to true happiness, and so no motivation to suspend my will in order to use reason to figure it out. Therefore, unity of consciousness (both backwardand forward-looking) is necessary to Locke’s account of persons as moral beings—beings that can bear responsibility for what they did in the past and exercise moral agency with respect to what they want to do in the future.49\n",

Where the difference between an apparent and a true good becomes evident is in the consideration of those absent pleasures or pains that we are not experiencing presently, but will experience in the future: But because not only present Pleasure and Pain, but that also which is apt by its efficacy, or consequences, to bring it upon us at a distance, is a proper Object of our desires, and apt to move a Creature, that has foresight; therefore things also that draw after them Pleasure and Pain, are considered as Good and Evil.

            "Furthermore, since both the concern for true happiness resulting in the suspension of desire and being motivated to act according to what reason recommends are necessary to the perfection our nature, unity of consciousness is too.51\n",

            "## 5.6 Animals are Conscious Too I have argued that the fact that we are conscious beings is foundational to the concern for ourselves that we are happy—that we attain the most pleasure possible—in this life and in an afterlife. Therefore, consciousness is also at the heart of the freedom necessary for rational and moral agency—that we are motivated to suspend desire to let reason play a role in all of our actions, including (and perhaps especially) making determinations about whether they are sanctioned by law. What does this argument mean for the moral status of animals? As part of my earlier argument that Yaffe’s solution to the “Where’s the agent problem” is insufficient to account for moral agency, I invoked the difference between non-human animals and persons. Let me say a little more about that now.\n",
            "\n",
            "Because Locke thinks that all animals have perception, and all perception is conscious, he is committed to the view that all animals are conscious. Moreover, I have been arguing that Locke thinks that all consciousness is self-consciousness.\n",
            "\n",
            "I realize that assigning consciousness and self-consciousness to very low forms of animal life (as Locke does to oysters and cockles) is quite odd. But perhaps we can see it as a matter of degree. Certainly, it is not so odd to think that many animals in some form or other assign their sensations (especially pleasures and pains) to themselves. It might also be that having more neural capacities (collections of neurons and ganglia) affects the nature and degree of consciousness in animals. Certainly these things can affect the nature of mental activity in general and whether or not the animal has more or fewer mental functions and the degree of their sophistication. Similarly, having reflection and various capacities for reason may affect the difference in the nature and degree of self-consciousness in persons and animals. Moreover, in order for many animals to be moved toward pleasures and away from pains, which they obviously are (and in a way that is not merely stimulus response), they, in some sense, must be able to see themselves as achieving those pleasures or pains.52 Thus, it is not at all a stretch to say that some animals are pre-reflectively self-conscious and have unity of consciousness.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now for the sticking point: Given that Locke thinks that all animals are conscious, would my interpretation not entail that (especially higher-functioning) animals have the same concern for their own pleasure and pain and so might have the same freedom we do? And if they have the same freedom, are they on the brink of moral agency? No, for they are unable to reflect and reason in the right way, and therefore cannot rationally assess (as Locke would see it) competing goods and compare their actions to laws, which is required for moral agency. True, Locke does consider animals (brutes) to have some form of reason: “For if they [brutes] have any Ideas\n",
            "\n",
            "at all, and are not bare Machins (as some would have them) we cannot deny them to have some reason” (II.xi.11). But he is clear that whatever that amounts to, it does not extend to reason utilizing general (abstract) ideas. He says, “If it may be doubted, whether Beasts compound and enlarge their Ideas that way, to any degree: This, I think, I may be positive in, That the power of Abstracting is not at all in them; and that the having of general Ideas, is that which puts a perfect distinction betwixt Man and Brutes; and is as Excellency which the Faculties of Brutes do by no means attain to” (II.xi.10). That brutes do not have abstract ideas precludes them from the sort of reasoning necessary for moral agency, for considering the value of competing goods as they do or do not compare to laws requires abstract ideas.\n",
            "\n",
            "Animals, therefore, are not “forensic” beings and so do not have the proper motivation (the concern for true happiness) to suspend the will. Remember that the suspension of the will and the making of rationally informed choices is the perfection of an intellectual nature.53 It leads to the kind and degree of happiness suitable to our “frame and constitution” as intelligent agents capable of a law and true happiness and misery, including in an afterlife. Analogously, we might see the perfection of an animal nature as consisting in the capacities that lead to the attaining of whatever kind and degree of happiness is suitable to its frame and constitution— perhaps its physical “preservation and the continuation of its species” (II.xxi.34).\n",
            "\n",
            "Although this passage from II.xxi.34 describes God’s having given human beings what they need for physical preservation, for example, the pangs of hunger and thirst, I take it that Locke is talking about human beings insofar as they are physical creatures, and not insofar as they might also be moral agents. Human beings considered in this way have what they need for the kind and degree of happiness suitable for a creature with that nature. Note that I am drawing a distinction between animals and persons instead of between non-human and human animals. Because of Locke’s commitment to nominalism (that the world does not come presorted into kinds) and his skepticism regarding what we can know of the inner constitutions of things, when it comes to the moral status of beings, it is unclear that he would want to draw a line between non-human and human animals, or between different animals, for fear of making a mistake. Indeed, this commitment might also be driving Locke’s reticence to deny perception and consciousness to mollusks.54\n",
            "\n",
            "For purposes of moral agency, the distinction is between animals (human and otherwise) and persons. In II.xxvii.9, Locke defines ‘person’ as “a thinking intelligent Being, that has reason and reflection, and can consider it self as it self, the same thinking thing in different times and places; which it does only by . . . consciousness.” It seems to me that this would include Prince Maurice’s rational parrot (II.xxvii.8), as long as it had reflection too. Locke’s point in telling the story about the parrot is that we should rethink our definitions of things, since it is a rational animal; yet because it has a\n",
            "\n",
            "much different body shape, we would not want to call it a man (human). Since animals are conscious, for Locke, their mental capacities must be distinguishable from persons by the fact that they do not have the right kind of reason and reflection and so are not capable of laws. So just as we, namely beings with an intellectual nature (moral agents), naturally have what we need to attain our perfection, including our long-term preservation in this life and the next, that is, a concern for true happiness resulting in the freedom to act according to what reason recommends, animals have what they need to attain their perfection, including preservation here and now.55 Were it otherwise, I dare say we would all be created miserable.\n",
            "\n",
            "## 5.7 Conclusion In this chapter, I have argued that consciousness plays a significant role in Locke’s account of rational and moral agency. That we are conscious beings is fundamental to the natural concern for ourselves that we attain true happiness—long-term happiness in this life and the next. Such concern for our own true happiness is crucial to the perfection of our nature as intellectual beings, for it results in our freedom to act according to what reason recommends. Our natural concern for our own true happiness ensures that our actions flow from our reason, because it moves the will to suspend present desires; it ensures the rational consideration of whether or not the action presently desired contributes to our true happiness. I have also argued that this account of consciousness allows for the unity of consciousness required for both moral responsibility and moral motivation. It provides the experience of a past self, which is necessary for assuming moral responsibility for past actions, and of a future self, which is necessary for generating the kind of motivation proper to moral agency.\n",
            "\n",
            "With this account of the way consciousness grounds moral agency, the narrative established at the beginning of this book comes full circle. That narrative began with the recognition that conscience, understood as an inner evaluative (moral) awareness of oneself, is not the only kind of self-awareness we experience. Indeed, it even seems (as was clear in Cudworth and is now clear in Locke) that rationally assessing the moral value of our own actions depends on a more fundamental non moral awareness of ourselves and of our own thinking. Consciousness, as a non-evaluative form of self-awareness, is fundamental not only to our philosophical psychology but also\n",
            "\n",
            "to our agency and to our experience of ourselves as rational and moral agents concerned about the long-term consequences of our actions. Moreover, for Locke, in order to be moral beings we must first be conscious beings. Having an evaluative experience of ourselves as moral beings (conscience) requires having a nonevaluative experience of ourselves as thinking beings (consciousness).\n",
            "\n",
            "Conclusion In light of the fledgling conceptions of consciousness found in some of Locke’s predecessors and contemporaries, this book argues for an interpretation of consciousness in Locke which makes sense of the various roles it plays in the Essay. Most importantly, consciousness has a role to play in Locke’s philosophical psychology and in his theories of knowledge, personal identity, and moral agency.\n",
            "\n",
            "Once consciousness is seen as a self-referential awareness internal to any act of thinking, the well-known interpretive problem of finding a suitable fit for consciousness in Locke’s model of the mind is solved. All thinking can be conscious without inviting a regress, threatening Locke’s empiricism, or conflicting with his commitment to the paucity of reflective abilities in young children. In addition, consciousness understood in this way lends coherence to Locke’s claims that we are always conscious of an I that is perceiving as well as being aware of the different perceptual sources of our ideas.\n",
            "\n",
            "Consciousness of an I perceiving internal to any mental act, which lends a firstpersonal character to all our thinking, entails that perceptions of ideas are complex mental states with constituent elements. At the very least there is an act of perception, an idea perceived, and consciousness. In addition, though, Locke sees every perception of an idea as accompanied by the perception of a simple idea of existence. Thus, every perception of an idea is actually a complex mental state composed of at least two ideas and consciousness. As I have argued, such complexity results in the fact that, for Locke, perceptions of ideas are complex propositional states.\n",
            "\n",
            "This explanation of the nature of our mental states opens the door to understanding how Locke could define knowledge in general as the perception of an agreement of ideas and yet also claim that some agreements can be known either on the basis of a single act of perception (whereby we know our own existence), or on the basis of the perception of a single idea, (whereby we know that individual idea). And if that single idea is an occurrent idea of sensation, we have knowledge of the existence of the cause of that idea insofar as Locke sees sensitive knowledge as a species of knowledge. Moreover, the analysis of how we know these kinds of particular truths is not unlike how we more standardly know general truths. In the latter case too, we have knowledge as the result of a complex mental state in which the compared or juxtaposed simultaneous ideas agree and are perceived to agree. Therefore, an analysis of the complexity of our mental states and the constituents therein provides\n",
            "\n",
            "CONCLUSION\n",
            "\n",
            "a coherent account of how we can know all the various types of agreements in Locke’s theory of knowledge.\n",
            "\n",
            "What is more, this analysis makes sense of Locke’s division of knowledge into degrees of certainty and his repeated claims that in spite of the fact that all knowledge is the perception of an agreement of ideas, we have sensitive knowledge of the existence of things external to us. Agreements perceived just in virtue of a complex mental state wherein there are agreeing constituents have psychological features that meet Locke’s conditions for certain knowledge. But not all perceived agreements meet other normative conditions that provide a higher degree of certainty. Where intuitive knowledge and demonstrative knowledge meet further normative conditions, sensitive knowledge does not. Thus, not only is having knowledge as the result of the complexity of our mental states fully compatible with Locke’s theory of knowledge as stated in the Essay and elsewhere, but also it lends consistency to that theory where it has always seemed somewhat lacking.\n",
            "\n",
            "Understanding the dual role of consciousness in Locke’s theory of personal identity enables us to see why Locke would place so much importance on a psychological condition for identity while at the same time holding on to commitments that require a metaphysical condition. Locke uses the term ‘consciousness’ ambiguously to mean both the psychological awareness of myself as thinking and as the metaphysical ongoing self I am aware of in that conscious state. Once we see that Locke’s theory includes a metaphysical criterion, all of the pieces of the theory fall neatly into place. Locke’s theory avoids the problems of transitivity, circularity, and sufficiency for his moral theory and his theological concerns. Furthermore, that consciousness provides a first-personal character to each mental act explains how we can experience the kind of diachronic unity of consciousness so necessary to Locke’s account of moral agency. Experiencing a past self is necessary for us to take responsibility for what we have done, and anticipating a future self is required for us to assess our future actions in terms of their moral value. Finally, that we are conscious of ourselves in every mental act is at the heart of a concern for our own true happiness, which enables us to exercise the kind of freedom necessary for moral agency and the perfection of an intellectual being. Therefore, we should see the conception of consciousness argued for here as a vital thread running through and pulling together central themes and arguments in Locke’s Essay.\n",
