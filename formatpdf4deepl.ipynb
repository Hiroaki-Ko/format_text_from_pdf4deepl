The first type is rudimentary consciousness which is minimally involved in all thinking. The second type is reflexive consciousness. . . . The third type of consciousness is a result of attentive reflection, whereby a person explicitly and deliberately thinks about her thoughts, attends to them, or considers them.” Thiel (2011: 46–8) argues, to the contrary, that “the second-order interpretation of Descartes’ understanding of consciousness is the most plausible one.” Defending Radner or Lähteenmäki against Thiel is not necessary, since my concern is only to show that seeing consciousness as a reflexive constituent of thinking is not only a plausible interpretation, but has a number of adherents.\n",
