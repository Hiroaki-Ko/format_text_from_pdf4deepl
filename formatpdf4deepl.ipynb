In this\\n', 'book, I extend my analysis of the role of consciousness in Locke’s Essay Concerning\\n', 'Human Understanding to other areas of his philosophy, including his theories of\\n', 'knowledge, personal identity, and moral agency. Consciousness is a thread running\\n', 'through and helping to resolve tensions in many of the most important aspects of\\n', 'Locke’s philosophy. Incipient is a complete picture of the role of consciousness in\\n', 'Locke’s Essay.\\n', '\\n', 'One theme will emerge as important to understanding the role consciousness plays\\n', 'in the Essay. Consciousness is self-consciousness. It is a non-evaluative self-\\n', 'referential form of awareness internal to all perceptions of ideas. It is the perception\\n', 'that I am perceiving an idea, or the perception of myself as perceiving an idea. Thus, a\\n', 'central theme running through the book is that perceptions of ideas, for Locke, are\\n', 'complex mental states in which we are conscious of more than just the idea\\n', 'perceived. In any perception of an idea, there is, at the very least, an act of perception,\\n', 'an idea perceived, and consciousness (that I am perceiving). And not only is there a\\n', 'complexity involved in the way in which perceptions of ideas can be said to perform\\n', 'their representational function, but also there is a complexity in perceptions of ideas\\n', 'that results in knowledge and that results in both a synchronic and diachronic\\n', 'experience of the unity of consciousness. How consciousness as internal to a more\\n', 'complex mental state can be seen to contribute to different perceptual situations has\\n', 'significant import for understanding various aspects of Locke’s philosophy. Showing\\n', 'that significance is a primary task of the book.\\n', '\\n', 'Here are just two ways, very briefly, in which this interpretation of consciousness\\n', 'plays out in Locke’s philosophy. First, consciousness as a constituent of a more\\n', 'complex mental state plays a significant role in constituting some agreements of\\n', 'ideas, the perception of which, for Locke, counts as knowledge. Importantly forLocke\\n', 'scholarship, once the complexity of our mental states is appreciated, we will see that\\n', 'Locke has no problem reconciling his general definition of knowledge as the percep-\\n', 'tion of an agreement or disagreement of ideas with his claims that we have know-\\n', 'ledge of particular things—of individual ideas, of our own existence, and of external\\n', 'world objects—all cases in which Locke seems to say that we perceive only one idea.\\n', '\\n', 'A big advantage of the interpretation, then, is that I show not only how Locke can\\n', 'consistently claim that we have knowledge of particular things, but also that the\\n', 'complexity of our perceptual states makes possible the agreement perceived in each\\n', 'case. What results is a structurally integrated account of how, for Locke, we have\\n', 'knowledge of individual ideas, of ourselves, and of external objects. All three turn out to be cases of non-inferential knowledge. Moreover, the analysis is not unlike how,\\n', 'for Locke, we more standardly know general truths. Therefore, interpreting con-\\n', 'sciousness as internal to a more complex mental state plays an important role in\\n', 'Locke’s theory of knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'Second, because consciousness is self-consciousness and is a constituent of a more\\n', 'complex mental state, there can be an experience of the unity of consciousness in\\n', 'perceiving simultaneous and successive ideas. Moreover, when there are ideas in the\\n', 'mind simultaneously and there are agreements between those ideas, we will be\\n', 'conscious of those agreements. Along with its contribution to an analysis of how\\n', 'there can be a seamless experience of the mind’s manipulation of ideas resulting in\\n', 'more complex ideas or in having knowledge, consciousness as internal to each\\n', 'perception of an idea allows that in certain kinds of perceptual situations we can\\n', 'be aware of ourselves as temporally extended. Such an experience of a past and future\\n', 'self is crucial to Locke’s accounts of personal identity and moral agency. So, con-\\n', 'sciousness as internal to any perceptual state allows for the experience we have of our\\n', 'own thinking as consisting in a sophistication and complexity necessary for under-\\n', 'standing aspects of Locke’s theory of knowledge, as well as of his theories of personal\\n', 'identity and moral agency, and resolving tensions in all three.\\n', '\\n', 'As the book unfolds, it will become clear exactly how consciousness plays its role\\n', 'in various areas of Locke’s philosophy and how the interpretation helps to resolve\\n', 'problems therein. Interpreting consciousness and the functions it performs, as I have,\\n', 'goes beyond what Locke says explicitly in the Essay or elsewhere. This is not to say\\n', 'that there is not sufficient textual evidence in favor of the interpretation, and I have\\n', 'limited my arguments to those areas of Locke’s philosophy where he obviously\\n', 'considered consciousness to play a positive role. But because of the paucity of\\n', 'explanation by Locke concerning how he understood consciousness, I have had to\\n', 'fill out the story for him. I suspect that Locke, himself, was not quite sure of his own\\n', 'conception. Nevertheless, once the needed distinctions concerning the nature of\\n', 'consciousness and the work it does are drawn for him, we see that other troubling\\n', 'aspects of Locke’s philosophy fall into place. Indeed, by providing a consistent account\\n', 'of how consciousness fits neatly into Locke’s philosophical psychology, by showing\\n', 'how consciousness as a constituent of a more complex mental state leads to a\\n', 'structurally integrated account of our knowledge of particular things, by providing\\n', 'an interpretation of consciousness in the theory of personal identity that solves well-\\n', 'known problems of transitivity, circularity, and sufficiency for Locke’s theological and\\n', 'moral concerns, and by providing a novel account of the nature of moral motivation,\\n', 'which provides for a robustness of agency needed and often lacking in causal theories\\n', 'of agency generally, I have gone much farther than any other interpretation of Locke\\n', 'on consciousness. In each case, I am making new and what I believe are important\\n', 'contributions to Locke scholarship. Of course, my claim is not that the interpretation\\n', 'of consciousness offered here solves all of Locke’s problems or that there might not be\\n', 'problems it cannot solve. I seek only to make Locke’s philosophy more coherent and integrated, and in the process provide solutions to what are considered some of its\\n', 'most troubling aspects.\\n', '\\n', 'In addition to lending internal coherence to Locke’s philosophy generally, another\\n', 'contribution of the interpretation is that Locke can be seen to be employing a notion\\n', 'of consciousness that is distinctively modern. As I read it, consciousness in Locke\\n', 'shares important similarities with later and contemporary phenomenological theor-\\n', 'ies of consciousness as well as with recent developments in cognitive science that\\n', 'argue for a distinct aspect of mentality responsible for the conscious awareness of the\\n', 'sources of our mental states. I am not claiming that these similarities should be seen\\n', 'as justification for my interpretation. Rather, because of these similarities I see this\\n', 'interpretation of consciousness and its role in Locke’s philosophy as having more\\n', 'than antiquarian interest.\\n', '\\n', 'After I historically situate the conception of consciousness I find in Locke in\\n', 'chapter one, I provide a much more detailed description of how that conception\\n', 'runs through other aspects of Locke’s philosophy. Nevertheless, a quick look at the\\n', 'book’s structure is in order. Chapter one sets the stage for seeing consciousness as a\\n', 'non-evaluative form of self-consciousness in Locke’s philosophical psychology. Early\\n', 'in the seventeenth century came the realization that not all forms of self-awareness\\n', 'are captured by the notion of conscience as an internal moral or evaluative awareness\\n', 'of oneself. By showing how some of Locke’s predecessors and contemporaries\\n', 'grappled with articulating this new kind of non-evaluative self-awareness, we can\\n', 'see how Locke himself might have seen the philosophical landscape and how he\\n', 'might have been influenced by what was going on around him. In this chapter, I am\\n', 'indebted to Catherine Glyn Davies’ (1990) and Udo Thiel’s (1994) work on Locke’s\\n', 'predecessors, which I discovered in 2005. It was primarily this early historical work\\n', 'by Thiel in addition to Mark Kulstad’s (1991) work on Locke that spurred my desire\\n', 'to find a consistent interpretation of consciousness in Locke (which I published in\\n', '2008) and to give an original account of its role in other aspects of his philosophy. In\\n', 'chapter two, I argue that Locke’s philosophical psychology includes a conception of\\n', 'consciousness as a special kind of reflexive awareness of ourselves internal to every\\n', 'act of perception. By distinguishing the consciousness of ourselves as thinking\\n', 'whenever we are thinking from other perceptual acts (primarily sensation and\\n', 'reflection), the interpretation is able to resolve a well-known tension in Locke’s\\n', 'model of the mind.\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter three is organized somewhat unusually in that it is divided into three\\n', 'parts, each of which provides an analysis of the role consciousness plays in aspects of\\n', 'Locke’s theory of knowledge: in how we have knowledge of individual ideas and of\\n', 'our own existence (in part I) and in how we have “sensitive” knowledge of the\\n', 'existence of external world objects (in part II). In each case, I provide a symmetrical\\n', 'account of the perception of an idea as a complex mental state in which conscious-\\n', 'ness is a constituent and has a significant role to play in the achievement of\\n', 'knowledge. These two parts together provide a coherent, integrated account of how we know particular things. In part III, I provide additional arguments to buttress the\\n', 'arguments in parts I and II, as well as addressing specific consequences of my view.\\n', '\\n', 'Moreover, the arguments in all three parts preserve consistency with all of Locke’s\\n', 'other commitments in his theory of knowledge. To my knowledge, there is currently\\n', 'no such account in Locke scholarship.\\n', '\\n', 'One might notice that I am excluding from the analysis the case of knowing God’s\\n', 'existence, which is the only other knowledge of a particular we have. The reason is\\n', 'that, for Locke, this is a form of demonstrative knowledge, namely inferential\\n', 'knowledge by means of a rational proof. Despite what one may think of the cogency\\n', 'of Locke’s argument, it does not present the same potential threat to Locke’s\\n', 'commitments in his theory of knowledge generally as do these other cases of\\n', 'knowing individual things. What is needed and what I provide is an account of\\n', 'how we have knowledge of particular truths seemingly when we perceive only one\\n', 'idea. The solution is to be found in the complexity of our perceptual states and the\\n', 'constituent elements, including consciousness.\\n', '\\n', 'Also in part III of chapter three, we see how Locke employs consciousness as an\\n', 'awareness of our own mental states to account for different perceptual situations\\n', 'constituting the different “degrees” of certainty of knowledge (intuitive, demonstra-\\n', 'tive, and sensitive) for which Locke is quite famous. Locke’s project in the Essay is to\\n', 'reveal the limits of human understanding by employing the “Historical, plain\\n', 'Method” (I.i.2) of providing a genetic account of knowledge beginning with what\\n', 'is manifest to us when we observe our own thinking. The fulcrum of Locke’s\\n', 'empiricism is the power of introspection to deliver a descriptive analysis of the\\n', 'nature of the mind and its activities without, however, delving into speculation\\n', 'about how ideas are produced either by the motions of bodies affecting our sense\\n', 'organs or in virtue of some sort of mind–body connection. Such a methodology, both\\n', 'emphasizing observation and confining analysis to the facts of experience, leads to an\\n', 'explanation of the role of consciousness in understanding how Locke could hold a\\n', 'representational theory of perception—that the immediate objects of perception are\\n', 'ideas—and that our knowledge of external world objects attains a degree of certainty\\n', 'deserving the name knowledge. To understand what he is up to, we can see Locke’s\\n', 'conception of the limits of knowledge as having two different strains according to\\n', 'two different perceptual situations: there is a psychological condition on knowledge\\n', 'and there is a normative condition on knowledge. Not only do we get a descriptive\\n', 'analysis of the different perceptual situations involved in perceiving agreements of\\n', 'ideas, and of the role Locke has consciousness play in helping to forge that difference,\\n', 'but also we get a normative understanding of how well the knowledge resulting from\\n', 'those perceptual situations stands up to a second-order consideration by virtue of the\\n', 'very same descriptive analysis. The ways in which the psychological condition and/or\\n', 'the normative condition are met determine the difference in degrees of certainty. We\\n', 'see this same distinction between perceptual situations having relevance also in\\n', 'Locke’s theory of personal identity.\\n', '\\n', 'How Locke understands consciousness as the criterion for personal identity is the\\n', 'subject of chapter four. Much interpretive ink has been spilled trying to reconcile\\n', 'various aspects of Locke’s theory. Although I think some are more successful than\\n', 'others, none of them accounts for Locke’s metaphysical and moral commitments\\n', 'without also generating some sort of tension. In keeping with the interpretation\\n', 'of consciousness put forward in previous chapters, and differently from any other\\n', 'interpretation, I show how consciousness can be sufficient for personal identity\\n', 'without either tempting circularity, failing logical transitivity, or putting philosoph-\\n', 'ical or textual pressure on other areas of Locke’s philosophy. Finally, in chapter five,\\n', 'I provide a fresh interpretation of Locke’s account of moral agency by showing how\\n', 'our freedom to engage in moral action is grounded in the fact that we are the kind of\\n', 'self-conscious beings we are. Included also is a novel interpretation of the motivation\\n', 'to suspend desire, which allows for a source of agency in ourselves that is always\\n', 'desired, but often missing, in causal theories of agency generally.\\\\What arises from these different analyses of the role of consciousness, and the\\n', 'complexity it lends to our perceptual states, is an understanding of consciousness as a\\n', 'coherent and unifying thread running throughout some of the most important areas\\n', 'of Locke’s philosophy.\\n', '\\n', '1 Consciousness in the Seventeenth Century\\n', '\\n', '1.1 ‘Consciousness’ and ‘Conscience’\\n', '\\n', '‘Consciousness’ in English and ‘conscience’ in French derive from the Latin\\n', '‘conscientia,’ which originally meant having knowledge that one shares with\\n', 'another.1 Being conscious was “being privy to something.”2 By the seventeenth\\n', 'century, however, the meaning of the French ‘conscience’ and the English ‘conscious-\\n', 'ness’ had more to do with sharing knowledge with oneself than with someone else.\\n', '\\n', 'More specifically, these words denoted a form of inner moral knowledge or an inner\\n', 'conviction with respect to a moral evaluation of one’s own thoughts and actions—\\n', 'what we more normally today associate with the English word ‘conscience.’3 During\\n', 'the middle decades of the seventeenth century the meaning changed again to include\\n', 'a non-evaluative knowledge of oneself. The OED cites uses of ‘consciousness’ and\\n', 'the adjective ‘conscious’ as early as 1620 to mean some sort of non-evaluative\\n', 'self-awareness,4 and with Descartes’ emphasis on an investigation of what we find\\n', 'in our own minds, the French ‘conscience’ underwent a similar shift in meaning.5\\n', 'The evolution of these terms in the latter part of the seventeenth century is in many\\n', 'respects a response, after Descartes, to capture the new interest and investigation of\\n', 'one’s own mental states, signaling a shift of philosophical focus from God’s universe\\n', 'and our place in it to ourselves as thinking beings.6 This new philosophical usage\\n', 'grew out of Descartes’ preoccupation with “examining the mind, its content, func-\\n', 'tions and powers.”7 It is generally recognized that Cudworth (1678) and Locke\\n', '(1689) were the first to give the English ‘consciousness’ a distinct philosophical\\n', '\\n', '1 This discussion of the history of the terms ‘conscience’ and ‘consciousness’ in Locke’s predecessors is indebted to Thiel (1994), Thiel (1991), and Davies (1990).\\n', '2 Thiel (1991: 81–2, n 10) cites Hobbes, Leviathan, I.7 as still using this definition.\\n', '3 Balibar (2013: 10–11).\\n', '4 See the third meaning cited in The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed., 1989: “conscious to oneself (of anything, that, etc.): having the witness of one’s own judgement or feelings, having the witness within oneself, knowing within oneself, inwardly sensible or aware.

And\\n', 'more explicitly, in the Third Replies we find “Further, there are other activities, which\\n', 'we call thinking activities, e.g. understanding, willing, imagining, feeling, etc., which\\n', 'agree in falling under the description of thought, perception, or consciousness”\\n', '(CSM II: 124; AT 7: 176).

Consider thought, he says, as “all those things, which, we being\\n', 'aware [conscious] occur in us, insofar as the awareness [consciousness] of them is in\\n', 'us” (CSM I: 195; AT 8A: 7).

The first type is rudimentary consciousness which is minimally involved in all thinking. The second type is reflexive consciousness. . . . The third type of consciousness is a result of attentive reflection, whereby a person explicitly and deliberately thinks about her thoughts, attends to them, or considers them.” Thiel (2011: 46–8) argues, to the contrary, that “the second-order interpretation of Descartes’ understanding of consciousness is the most plausible one.” Defending Radner or Lähteenmäki against Thiel is not necessary, since my concern is only to show that seeing consciousness as a reflexive constituent of thinking is not only a plausible interpretation, but has a number of adherents.\\n', '\\n', '34 See also Brentano (1973: 123).\\n', '\\n', '35 Alanen (2003: 83) takes thought and consciousness to have different meanings, where “consciousness or immediate awareness [i]s a mark by which mental acts and states qualifying as thoughts are recognized and distinguished from other acts and states.” The reflexivity distinctive of consciousness she describes (p. 100) is similar to Frankfurt’s (1988: 162) description of it as “a sort of immanent reflexivity in virtue of which every instance of being conscious grasps not only that of which it is an awareness but also the awareness of it.”\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'act of thinking of x, which has x as its primary object and itself as its secondary\\n', 'object.” So consciousness as we find it in Descartes’ writings has an ambiguity.

And even though we are reflexively\\n', 'conscious (C2) of every act of thinking, we do not reflect on every act of thinking.\\n', '\\n', '“Every thought is an object of C2,” Radner (1988: 448) explains, “but not every\\n', 'thought is an object of another thought.” In addition, although it goes beyond\\n', 'Radner’s claims and to argue the point fully is beyond the scope of what is important\\n', 'for the arguments in this book, my suggestion is that her argument opens the door to\\n', 'an interpretation of Descartes in which we can read C2 as also including a specific\\n', 'reference to the self.38 There is a longstanding debate concerning how exactly to\\n', 'interpret what is involved in arriving at the conclusion that I exist in Descartes’ cogito\\n', 'argument. Descartes claims that after he has doubted away everything that could\\n', 'possibly exist in the world, he still must be convinced that he exists: “But I have\\n', 'convinced myself that there is absolutely nothing in the world, no sky, no earth, no\\n', 'minds, no bodies.

He says, “this (old) problem arises for theories, according to which (1) relating to oneself through consciousness is a mental act distinct from the act to which it relates, and (2) each mental act is simultaneously accompanied by an act of consciousness. If (1) and (2) are accepted, it follows that each act of consciousness is in turn accompanied by another act of consciousness, and so on ad infinitum. . . . Hobbes points out that the problem arises only if consciousness is said to be simultaneous with the act which is its object; and he concludes that knowledge of our own thoughts and actions can relate only to a past, It seems that Descartes, however, does not regard the infinite regress as a problem, as he does not address it in any detail in his response to Hobbes. From the passage in the Conversation with Burman, however, it is clear why the infinite regress is not a problem for him. The soul ‘has the power to reflect on its thoughts as often as it likes, and to be conscious of its thoughts in this way’ because ‘the soul is capable of thinking of more than one thing at the same time, and of continuing with a particular thought which it has.’”\\n', 'Thiel then concludes, “It seems, then, that a second-order interpretation of Descartes’ understanding of consciousness is the most plausible one.” I must confess that I struggle to understand Thiel’s argument.\\n', '\\n', 'Perhaps he is arguing only against Hobbes’s formulation of the regress problem in that if consciousness is not simultaneous with the original perception, which it would not be if it is a second-order act, then the regress is avoided. Importantly, for my purposes, the regress is also avoided if consciousness is a reflexive ingredient of thinking as interpreted by Radner and Lähteenmäki.\\n', '\\n', '38 See, for example, Ainslie (2013: 91).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'considering everything very thoroughly, I must finally conclude that this proposition,\\n', 'I am, I exist, is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my\\n', 'mind” (CSM II: 17; AR VII: 25).

In order to accomplish this, she is supposed to imagine herself: (10) in a pristine, newly created, but fully perfect (kāmilan) state; this allows her to disregard all empirical knowledge, while presupposing an intellect with full rational capacities; and (20) suspended in a void so that her limbs do not touch one another and she can neither see, hear, touch, smell, nor taste anything. This prevents her both from feeling her own body and from sensing external objects. Avicenna then asks whether self-awareness would be absent from such a state. Would a person, while deprived of all sensory experience, be entirely lacking in self-awareness?\\n', '\\n', 'Avicenna believes that no one ‘endowed with insight’ would deny her awareness of herself would remain stable even in these conditions.” He is confident that even under these extreme conditions, the subject would continue to affirm ‘the existence of his self ’ (wujūd dhāti-hi).”\\n', '41 Specifically, Radner (1988: 449–51) argues that once we appreciate the distinction between C1 and C2\\n', 'there is no need to saddle Descartes with either the “Evidence Thesis” or the “Incorrigibility Thesis.”\\n', 'Therefore, all the problems stemming from holding those theses dissolve.

But Arnauld’s distinction is framed as two\\n', 'different kinds of reflection: réflexion virtuelle, which he sometimes refers to as\\n', 'consciousness and réflexion expresse.55 Arnauld (1990: VI, 71) differentiates them\\n', 'as follows: “The first is that our thought or perception is essentially reflective upon\\n', 'itself: or, as it is said rather better in Latin, est sui conscia. For I do not think without\\n', 'knowing that I think; I do not know a square without knowing that I know it; or to\\n', 'avoid any doubt, I do not imagine I see the sun, without being certain that I imagine\\n', 'I see it.” Réflexion virtuelle describes the way in which all thinking has an implicit\\n', 'reflection upon itself. As well as this “implicit reflection, which accompanies all our\\n', 'perceptions,” continues Arnauld, “there is also something explicit [réflexion ex-\\n', 'presse], which occurs when we examine our perception by means of another percep-\\n', 'tion.” Réflexion virtuelle, then, is a reflexive aspect of every perception or thinking by\\n', 'which we are aware that we are perceiving. It is not a distinct act of perception itself,\\n', 'but rather a reflexive self-awareness implicit in an act of perception.56 Réflexion\\n', 'expresse, on the other hand, is a distinct mental act that takes the original perception\\n', 'as its object.

Nadler (1989: 118–22)\\n', 'offers the following solution. First, he interprets Arnauld’s claim that “the idea of an\\n', 'object and the perception of that object . . . [are] . . . the same thing” as saying not that\\n', 'they are in a relation of inseparability, but rather they are identical: the act of\\n', 'perception and the idea are one thing under different descriptions bearing relations\\n', 'to different things. When described as an “act of perception,” the perception/idea is in\\n', 'relation to the mind as modification, and when described as an “idea,” it is in relation\\n', 'to an object as representation.59 Nadler refers to the act of perception, which is\\n', 'identical to an idea, as a “perception-idea.” Moreover, Nadler (1989: 115) points out\\n', 'that Arnauld employs the scholastic distinction between an id quod intelligitur, namely\\n', 'what is actually understood, and an id quo intelligitur, namely that by means of which\\n', 'the intellect understands.

Because Hoffman’s argument sees the use of intentional content as Arnauld does in one’s theory of perception as implying a form of representationalism, his objection does not also cut against what interest I have in Nadler’s interpretation of Arnauld.\\n', '\\n', 'That is, nothing in Nadler’s interpretation of Arnauld changes except whether to call him a representationalist or a direct realist—an issue orthogonal to finding a reflexive self-referential act of perception in Arnauld’s perceptual theory.\\n', '\\n', '58 Arnauld (1990: VI, 70–1).\\n', '\\n', '59 Nadler (1989: 109–11). See also Balibar (2013: 29): “According to Arnauld, ideas should be understood as the means of a ‘double relation’: a relation to the soul that thinks (of which they are a modification) and to the object that they represent, according to a specific mode which could not in general be reducible to the notion of a picture or an image.

By interpreting Arnauld as\\n', 'meaning consciousness, or réflexion virtuelle, as a reflexive constituent of a perception-\\n', 'idea rather than as a separate reflective act, argues Nadler, Arnauld can have a direct\\n', 'awareness of an object, or at least its objective reality,60 by virtue of being conscious of a\\n', 'perception-idea. First, let us take a look at Arnauld’s explanation:\\n', 'Since every perception is essentially representative of something, and is thus called an idea, a\\n', 'perception cannot be essentially reflective on itself without this idea (that is, the objective reality of the thing which the mind is said to perceive) being its immediate object. So that . . . the\\n', 'objective reality . . . is the object of this perception.

For our purposes here we\\n', 'can just say that the objective reality of an idea, for Arnauld, is its representational\\n', 'content.62 And because the perception-idea is “essentially reflective on itself,” the object-\\n', 'ive reality must be the immediate object of the perception-idea. Therefore, in perceiving\\n', 'we are directly aware of that objective reality. Nadler (1989: 121) sums it up this way:\\n', 'Arnauld’s position is simply the following: every act of perception, by which we immediately and\\n', 'directly perceive an external object . . . is also immediately reflective upon itself. Thus, when\\n', 'directly perceiving an external thing, one is always aware that one is perceiving that thing. . . .\\n', '\\n', 'Arnauld later states that . . . the act of perception is essentially representative of the external object perceived, and thus is the object in the understanding objectivement or intelligiblement. . . . The same act of perception which reflects [virtuelle] on (is aware of) itself is the means of perceiving immediately and directly an external body. As he puts it, a perception is both id quo intelligitur\\n', 'and id quod intelligitur.\\n', '\\n', 'By interpreting Arnauld to understand consciousness (réflexion virtuelle) as a reflex-\\n', 'ive form of self-reference that is not a mental act separate from the perception-idea,\\n', 'Nadler clarifies and makes coherent what has otherwise been interpreted as being an\\n', 'inconsistency or at least a conundrum in Arnauld’s theory of perception.63 Because\\n', 'consciousness accompanies perception, what is represented by the perception-idea\\n', '60 By “objective reality” is meant the object as it has reality in the mind in much the same way as Descartes and the scholastic tradition before him employed the notion.\\n', '\\n', '61 I have used Nadler’s (1989: 120) translation here as I think it is much clearer.\\n', '\\n', '62 Nadler (1989: 172 and ch. 6) includes a very good discussion of the different meanings of ‘objective reality’ in Suarez, Descartes, and Malebranche.\\n', '\\n', '63 Reid’s (1986: I, 297) conclusion is that Arnauld in his “weak attempt to reconcile two inconsistent doctrines” has “given up” his own notion of ideas “in attempting to reconcile it to the common doctrine concerning ideas.” Reid’s accusation against Arnauld is that in trying to accommodate the more popular representational theory of perception, namely the “way of ideas,” Arnauld can no longer be said to have a direct theory of perception.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'can be seen as an object of direct awareness without the mediation of some other\\n', 'perception-idea—or even as mediated by the perception-idea itself.

Pierre Bayle (1968: IV, 457) considers there to be an immediate self-reference involved in\\n', 'perception; yet, somewhat like Arnauld, he distinguishes two kinds of reflection: an inherent reflexivity and a separate mental act whereby “the soul examines its own acts.” See Lewis (1950: 113, 119), Davies (1990: 11, 18–19), Thiel (1994: 100–2), and Thiel (2011: 52–4) for discussions of these views.\\n', '\\n', '66 Thiel (1991: 79) and Thiel (2011: 67).\\n', '\\n', '67 Thiel (1994: 94) and Thiel (2011: 8, 67).\\n', '\\n', '68 “Consciousness,” Cudworth (1678: 871) says, “is essential to Cogitation.” Even though Cudworth\\n', 'uses consciousness to distinguish the rational part of the soul from instincts, reflexes, organic functions, habits, and dreams, all thinking, including sensations, which are also considered a part of incorporeal mental life, is conscious.

As with self-consciousness, in reflection we gain a\\n', 'higher-level knowledge of ourselves than what we have in consciousness as synaisthēsis.\\n', '\\n', 'Cudworth (1838: 71) says, “We are certain by inward sense that we can reflect upon\\n', 'ourselves and consider ourselves, which is a reduplication of life in a higher degree; for\\n', 'all cogitative beings as such are self-conscious.” Cudworth’s use of ‘self-conscious’ at\\n', 'the end of the passage is not the consciousness of the self in terms of its existence, but\\n', 'rather the consciousness of thoughts and actions in the more fundamental form of self-\\n', 'attribution.75 So, Cudworth seems to be saying that although all sentient beings are\\n', 'conscious of their thoughts and actions, only those beings capable of higher-order\\n', 'reflective mental activity are also capable of higher-order knowledge not only of their\\n', 'own thoughts, but also of themselves. In taking a higher-level reflective stance toward\\n', 'our own conscious thoughts we gain a more contemplative or objectified knowledge of\\n', 'the self.

Again, Lähteenmäki (2010: 24) sees these as degrees of self-consciousness to be distinguished from elementary consciousness: “there is not a clear cut demarcation between realms of elementary consciousness and self-consciousness that would allow straightforward categorizing of any given experience. But by presenting examples of what he thinks are indisputable cases Cudworth disen-tangles simple subjective experience from self-consciousness.” For example, where animals would have\\n', '“elementary consciousness” or consciousness as synaisthēsis, human beings, because of their higher\\n', 'cognitive capacities would have self-consciousness, self-reflection, and self-judgment.\\n', '\\n', '74 Because the difference between Lähteenmäki and Thiel does not extend to the details of the different forms of self-reference (Thiel), or degrees of self-consciousness (Lähteenmäki), and Thiel lays them out more simply, which suits better my purposes here, I am using Thiel’s language.\\n', '\\n', '75 Thiel (1991: 92, n 44) and Thiel (2011: 69).\\n', '\\n', '76 Thiel (1991: 92) and Thiel (2011: 70).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'from taking a reflective stance toward those actions we have attributed to ourselves\\n', 'by virtue of consciousness.

As Cudworth explains, conscience “is attributed to rational beings only, and\\n', 'such as are sensible of the discrimen honestorum or turpium when they judge of their\\n', 'own actions according to that rule, and either condemn or acquit themselves.”79\\n', 'Because we attribute actions to ourselves in one form of self-reference and we are\\n', 'capable of measuring those actions to standards of right and wrong in another form\\n', 'of self-reference, we are able to judge (“condemn or acquit”) ourselves, which is a\\n', 'third form of self-reference.80\\n', 'Finally, once there is self-reference by consciousness and reflection, there is also\\n', 'the possibility of self-reference by “self-determination” with respect to action.

Indeed, as all of the thinkers I have mentioned realized,\\n', 'conscience as evaluative self-reference cannot do the right kind of work to ground\\n', 'these nonmoral aspects of our psychology. Therefore, as Cudworth (and I think\\n', 'Locke indirectly) realized, moral evaluation of ourselves requires first that we have a\\n', 'more fundamental awareness of ourselves as subjects. As we will see in the following\\n', 'chapters, although Locke does not distinguish the same kinds of self-reference, he can\\n', 'be seen to have an understanding of consciousness as a fundamental form of self-\\n', 'reference, or self-attribution of thoughts and actions, that plays a role in other forms\\n', 'of self-reference. I will argue that, like Cudworth’s, Locke’s conception of conscious-\\n', 'ness includes a relation to the self as subject that plays a role in how we know our own\\n', 'existence and how we experience ourselves as moral agents, although in both cases\\n', 'the account will be somewhat different from what we find in Cudworth.

Interestingly, Locke and Cudworth can be seen to share this\\n', 'feature of consciousness with Malebranche, although for Locke and for Cudworth,\\n', 'ideas are in our minds, not in God’s. La Forge, Malebranche, Cudworth, and Locke\\n', 'can also be said to share the view that consciousness involves more of a sentiment or\\n', 'feeling than an idea. More importantly, although Locke does not specifically call\\n', 'consciousness a sentiment or feeling, he does say that we cannot think without being\\n', '“sensible of it” and that being sensible of our own thinking is necessary to thinking\\n', '“till we can think without being conscious of it” (II.i.10).\\n', '\\n', 'participating in man’s ethical self-formation instead of being merely some piece or other of discursive reasoning.” She (2014: 312) explains that it is the more fundamental form of self-consciousness, the “to-oneself ”\\n', 'consciousness, that makes us know with certainty, as Cudworth (1838: 193) says, “that there is in us some one hegemonical,” “comprehending all the other powers, energies, and capacities of our soul.” Pécharman (2014: 310) goes on to say that it is this recognition of oneself as “hegemonic” at the most fundamental level that “gives the will its true significance as free will or self-power.” Thus, “The to-oneself consciousness includes the very self-comprehension and self-determination of the soul” (2014: 312).\\n', '\\n', 'Most important to understanding how we should read Locke’s conception of\\n', 'consciousness, however, is its similarity to Descartes’ and Arnauld with respect to\\n', 'the relation between consciousness, first-order thought, and reflection (considered as\\n', 'a distinct act of second-order thought). The important point is to notice how each\\n', 'can be helped to a coherent conception of consciousness with respect to thought and\\n', 'reflection once consciousness is interpreted as a reflexive constituent of any thought.\\n', '\\n', 'Once this conception of consciousness is recognized in Descartes—what Radner\\n', 'designated C2—not only can we make better sense of the text, but the regress\\n', 'problem attributed to him by Hobbes as well as other interpretive problems simply\\n', 'evaporates.

Interestingly, though, Caston (2002: 751, 769) argues that Aristotle has a conception of consciousness in which it is a reflexive mental state intrinsic to other mental states and that phenomenal experience is irreducible to representational content. What is more, he argues that Brentano was heavily influenced by Aristotle.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'have a conception of consciousness as a self-referential kind of perception internal\\n', 'to or constituent of any other perceptual act.

In addition, consciousness so\\n', 'interpreted helps to make sense of the work Locke seems to see consciousness doing\\n', 'in his theories of knowledge, personal identity, and moral agency. What results is the\\n', 'view that Locke understands perception in general as having a certain complexity\\n', 'that explains how consciousness carries out the roles Locke either assigns it explicitly\\n', 'or has it doing implicitly in these other aspects of his philosophy. What becomes\\n', 'apparent in this second chapter is that because consciousness is a constituent of any\\n', 'perceptual act, every perception of an idea is a complex mental state that includes an\\n', 'act of perception, an idea, and consciousness.86\\n', 'Chapter three extends this model of the mind to Locke’s theory of knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'Knowledge, for Locke, consists in “the perception of the connexion and agreement, or\\n', 'disagreement and repugnancy of any of our ideas” (IV.i.2). What we will see is that\\n', 'any knowledge state is a complex mental state that includes agreements or disagree-\\n', 'ments between constituent elements. And when it comes to our knowledge of\\n', 'individual things, consciousness plays an active role in constituting those agree-\\n', 'ments. Part I of chapter three focuses on two cases of knowing a particular thing that\\n', 'receive little attention in Locke scholarship: the intuitive knowledge of our own\\n', 'individual ideas and the intuitive knowledge of ourselves—the latter being Locke’s\\n', 'version of the cogito argument. Once we appreciate that perceptions of ideas are\\n', 'complex mental states, we can see how, for Locke, we can have knowledge consistent\\n', 'with his general definition when we seem to perceive only one idea. One fortuitous\\n', 'consequence of the analysis of how these agreements are constituted is clarification of\\n', 'how we have, as Locke claims, non-inferential knowledge of these individual things\\n', '(both ourselves and ideas), something he leaves relatively obscure. In part II of\\n', 'chapter three, I extend the analysis by providing a structurally similar explanation\\n', 'of the agreement in a case of sensitive knowledge (of the existence of an external\\n', 'object) such that all of Locke’s claims concerning the nature of knowledge in general\\n', 'and the nature of the agreement in sensitive knowledge are accounted for.

But once we add in the idea as the object of the perceptual or mental act, we have an even more complex perceptual or mental state. And as will be argued, for Locke, the complexity of a perceptual or mental state is not limited to a perceptual act, an idea, and consciousness, although those three elements are always present. In part I of chapter three, we will see that Locke is committed to at least one more constituent of every perceptual state.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'role of consciousness in constituting the agreement known in an instance of sensitive\\n', 'knowledge is what drives Locke to claim it is indeed a form of certain knowledge,\\n', 'albeit with a lesser degree of certainty than what we normally consider knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'From my interpretation of consciousness as a constituent of a more complex\\n', 'perceptual state there results something brand new to Locke scholarship: a structur-\\n', 'ally integrated account of how, for Locke, we have knowledge of individual things\\n', '(our own ideas, ourselves, and external objects) consistent with all of his other\\n', 'commitments.87\\n', 'Consciousness as internal to every mental state also helps to explain, in chapter\\n', 'four, what Locke is up to in his theory of personal identity. I argue that in that chapter\\n', 'of the Essay Locke uses the term ‘consciousness’ ambiguously to mean both the state\\n', 'of awareness of myself as perceiving ideas and the ongoing self I am aware of in those\\n', 'mental states.88 That is, Locke combines a psychological aspect to personal identity\\n', 'with a metaphysical aspect that is not identified with either thinking or bodily\\n', 'substance.

Finally, in chapter five, I extend my interpretation of\\n', 'consciousness to Locke’s account of freedom and moral agency and specifically to\\n', 'his arguments for moral motivation. First, taking responsibility for our past actions\\n', 'as well having motivation to do that which we ought to do requires that we see\\n', 'ourselves as the same self extending into the past and into the future.

Only so are we able to generate the\\n', 'concern for the happiness of a future self as required for moral agency.\\n', '\\n', 'Second, Locke’s account of moral agency requires that we are able to suspend a\\n', 'pressing desire in order to engage in a rational assessment of whether or not a\\n', 'particular action best achieves our long-term happiness. Locke, however, provides\\n', 'only a sketch of how we are able to generate the proper motivation to suspend desire.\\n', '\\n', 'Although he claims that we have an innate drive toward happiness and away from\\n', 'misery, this cannot provide the necessary motivation unless Locke is willing to say\\n', 'that we always suspend desire, for this innate drive operates “constantly” and “without\\n', '87 Again, I am not considering our knowledge of the existence of God, since it is an instance of\\n', 'demonstrative knowledge posing no threat to the general definition of knowledge.\\n', '\\n', '88 Here we might see another similarity to Cudworth’s (1678: 159) understanding of consciousness as involving a “duplication” whereby “the self is both subject (i.e. that which is conscious) as well as the object of consciousness (i.e. that which I am aware of when I am conscious).”\\n', '89 Divine rectification is a theological commitment to God’s meting out just punishment on Judgment Day.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'ceasing” (I.iii.3).

See also Ayers (1991: I, 309, n 99), who seems to agree that Locke’s view is incoherent.\\n', '\\n', '8 I interpret consciousness in Locke as self-consciousness.

Perceptual states, according to this view,\\n', 'just are conscious states, and there is no role for consciousness independent of\\n', 'perception. So, when Locke states, as he does on many occasions, that consciousness\\n', 'is necessary or essential to thinking, he is seen as making no distinction between\\n', 'consciousness and perception.9 This interpretation,10 however, cannot do justice to\\n', 'Locke’s understanding of the contributions to perception made by consciousness.\\n', '\\n', 'There is then no way to account for the role of consciousness in Locke’s explanation of\\n', 'memory, his version of Descartes’s cogito argument for the existence of the thinker, or\\n', 'his accounts of sensitive knowledge and personal identity. In each of these accounts,\\n', 'Locke suggests that consciousness adds something to ordinary perception or even that\\n', 'consciousness is a special kind of awareness of a perception. For example, in IV.ii.14,\\n', 'we find Locke asking rhetorically whether one “be not invincibly conscious to himself\\n', 'of a different Perception, when he looks on the Sun by day, and thinks on it by night”\\n', '(my emphasis). Similarly, in II.xxvii.9, Locke seems to say that consciousness is the\\n', 'perception of a perception that in some way grounds our claims to personal identity.\\n', '\\n', 'A ‘person’ is defined as someone who can “consider [him] self as [him] self, . . . which\\n', '[he] does, only by that consciousness, which is inseparable from thinking, and as it\\n', 'seems to me essential to it: It being impossible for any one to perceive, without\\n', 'perceiving, that he does perceive.” Although consciousness is “essential” to perception\\n', 'and inseparable from it, it seems to be responsible for something in addition to\\n', 'perception: say, the awareness that I am the one having the perception.11 Moreover,\\n', 'in each of these accounts Locke clearly seems to distinguish between ‘consciousness’\\n', 'and ‘perception,’ indicating that the terms have different references. In his\\n', '9 For example, in I.ii.5 we find “No Proposition can be said to be in the Mind, which it never yet knew, which it was never yet conscious of,” and in II.i.12, “Whilst [the soul] thinks and perceives, it is capable certainly of those of Delight or Trouble, as well as any other Perceptions; and it must necessarily be conscious of its own Perceptions.” Other passages asserting the necessary relation between consciousness and thinking or perception include II.i.11, II.i.18, and II.xxvii.9.\\n', '\\n', '10 In the last chapter we saw that a similar issue arises in Descartes. As noted there, the majority of translators maintain a distinction between consciousness and thinking in Descartes by translating cogitatio or pensée as ‘thought’ and conscientia or conscience as ‘consciousness’ or ‘awareness.’\\n', '11 See also II.xxvii.16 and II.xxvii.24.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'endorsement of the cogito, to give another example, Locke can be understood to\\n', 'delineate consciousness from perception in general when he writes, “In every Act of\\n', 'Sensation, Reasoning, or Thinking, we are conscious to our selves of our own Being;\\n', 'and, in this Matter, come not short of the highest degree of Certainty” (IV.ix.3). Along\\n', 'with the act of thinking is consciousness that I am the thinker.\\n', '\\n', 'Even more troublesome, identifying consciousness with perception fails to\\n', 'acknowledge the importance of consciousness in one of Locke’s most cogent argu-\\n', 'ments against innate ideas.12 That argument runs roughly as follows. Innate ideas, if\\n', 'not yet perceived, must somehow be already in the mind prior to any new ideas\\n', 'originating in either sensation or reflection. But, for Locke, ideas that are in the mind\\n', 'but not presently perceived are experienced as memories. So, just as we can tell the\\n', 'difference between a new idea and a memory, to claim that we have innate ideas\\n', 'requires that we can also identify them as somehow different from memories. How\\n', 'we identify an idea as a memory, for Locke, is through the conscious perception of it.\\n', '\\n', 'Experiencing ideas as having been in the mind before consists in the mind’s “Power . . . to\\n', 'revive Perceptions, which it once had, with this additional Perception annexed to\\n', 'them, that it has had them before” (II.x.2). That Locke sees consciousness as this\\n', '“additional annexed perception” is evident when he says, “This consciousness of\\n', 'its [the idea’s] having been in the mind before, being that, which distinguishes\\n', 'Remembring from all other ways of Thinking” (I.iv.20). Thus, the argument that\\n', 'there are innate ideas rests on answering Locke’s challenge to show that we have ideas\\n', 'that are experienced as neither new to the mind nor as memories. Therefore, to\\n', 'understand consciousness as identical to perception in general is to ignore Locke’s\\n', 'explicit claim that consciousness does additional work in distinguishing or singling\\n', 'out memories as memories, and therefore to ignore the essential role consciousness\\n', 'plays in Locke’s first-line defense of empiricism. Those who equate consciousness\\n', 'with perception seem to pass by this issue altogether.13\\n', '2.2.1 Consciousness is identical to reflection\\n', 'Another way to interpret Locke is to attribute to him the view that consciousness\\n', 'contributes something to perception as some sort of second-order awareness of\\n', 'perceptions.14 This is consistent with his claim that all thinking is conscious and\\n', 'with consciousness being a perception of a perception.15 Assigning to Locke the view\\n', 'that consciousness is a higher-order perceptual state in which we are aware of our\\n', '12 Atherton (1998: 51) argues that because of the “strong connection between ‘being in the mind’ and\\n', '‘being in consciousness,’ ” Locke’s arguments against innate ideas are not trivial.\\n', '\\n', '13 An exception is Ayers (1991: I, 288), who, nevertheless, recognizes the cogency of my line of\\n', 'argumentation. On his view, Locke should have identified consciousness with perception to accommodate his imagism but could not, because, for Locke, “the intrinsic intentional content of conscious thought typically goes beyond the intrinsic intentional content of the sensations and images involved in it.”\\n', '14 All those mentioned in notes 3 (Leibniz et al.), 4 (Cousin et al.), and 7 (Kulstad et al.) take the view that consciousness is a second-order awareness of perceptions.\\n', '\\n', '15 Note that a regress looms. This issue will be addressed shortly.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'own thinking, however, gives rise to a difficulty for Locke with respect to what he says\\n', 'in the following passage:\\n', 'For the Objects of our Senses, do, many of them, obtrude their particular Ideas upon our\\n', 'minds, whether we will or no: And the Operations of our minds, will not let us be without, at\\n', 'least some obscure Notions of them.

Arriving at this conclu-\\n', 'sion relies on the textual interpretation that when Locke asserts that we are never\\n', '“wholly ignorant of what [we] do when we think,” he should be understood to mean,\\n', '“No man can be wholly ignorant of the particular thing he does at a moment when he\\n', 'thinks in a particular way” (Kulstad 1991: 111).16 This interpretation suggests that we\\n', 'have a particular idea of the thinking we perceive within ourselves, and the reason\\n', 'why it must be a particular idea is that “the Understanding can no more refuse to have\\n', '[those simple ideas offered to it] . . . , than a mirror can refuse . . . the Images, . . . which,\\n', 'the Objects set before it, do therein produce” (II.i.25). Therefore, this passage is\\n', 'understood to be saying that the reason I am not ignorant of what I am doing when\\n', 'I am thinking is that I have a particular idea of my thinking. But if consciousness is\\n', 'responsible for ideas of my thinking, and ideas of my thinking are ideas of reflection,\\n', 'then, as Kulstad (1991) and others have argued, we should understand Locke to be\\n', 'identifying consciousness and reflection.17 Thus, conscious states are reflective states,\\n', 'which means that any mental state emerging as the result of consciousness is the result\\n', 'of a second-order reflective act.\\n', '\\n', '16 Kulstad (1991: 111, n 62) justifies this interpretation in the following way: “It may be thought that I have misconstrued Locke here. Since the point is important, let’s consider a bit more carefully a crucial sentence: ‘No man can be wholly ignorant of what he does when he thinks.’ This would seem to be open to at least two different interpretations, which can be roughly formulated as follows:\\n', '(1) No man can be wholly ignorant of the particular thing he does at a moment when he thinks in a\\n', 'particular way.\\n', '\\n', '(2) No man can be wholly ignorant of the general sort of thing he does when he thinks.\\n', '\\n', 'I judge that interpretation (1) is correct. For in the sentence following immediately after the one presently under discussion, Locke says that a mind cannot refuse simple ideas offered to the mind any more than a ‘mirror can refuse . . . images . . . which the objects set before it do therein produce.’ It seems to me that a person who had no idea of the particular mental operation he or she was performing at the moment would in effect be refusing an idea set before the mind . . . Given this point, I view Locke’s statement, that ‘the operation of our minds will not let us be without, at least, some obscure notions of them,’ to mean that any time there is an operation in our minds we acquire at least an obscure idea of it.\\n', '\\n', 'I assume that, for Locke, this idea is acquired by our perception of the operation, which perception must be present, since there is nothing in the mind of which we are not conscious.”\\n', '17 Those in note 3 (Leibniz et al.).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Here comes the difficulty presented in the preceding quotation (II.i.25) from Locke\\n', 'to this line of interpretation. Should Locke be interpreted as seeing consciousness\\n', 'identical to reflection, he runs into trouble reconciling consciousness with his claims\\n', 'concerning the reflective abilities of young children. In II.i.8 he admits that children\\n', 'might have “floating Visions,” namely some perception of their own thinking; yet he\\n', 'explicitly denies that children can reflect:\\n', 'And hence we see the reason, why ’tis pretty late, before most Children get Ideas of the\\n', 'Operations of their own Minds; and some have not very clear, or perfect Ideas of the greatest\\n', 'part of them all their Lives. Because, though they pass there continually; yet like floating\\n', 'Visions, they make not deep Impressions enough, to leave in the Mind clear and distinct lasting\\n', 'Ideas, until the Understanding turns inwards upon it self, reflects on its own Operations, and\\n', 'makes them the Object of its own Contemplation.\\n', '\\n', '(II.i.8)\\n', 'The “obscure Notions” in II.i.25 and perhaps also the “floating Visions” in II.i.8\\n', 'must be due to consciousness. But if they are, and consciousness and reflection are\\n', 'the same mental act, then Locke contradicts his claim in II.i.8 that young children,\\n', 'though conscious, do not reflect.18 In Locke’s defense it seems unlikely he would\\n', 'make this mistake. The lack of reflective abilities in young children is important to\\n', 'his commitment to reflection as a more mature kind of thinking. Since reflection is\\n', 'a higher-level thinking about perceptions of ideas that leads to clearer and more\\n', 'distinct ideas concerning our mental operations, it is likely that Locke thought\\n', 'young children are incapable of gaining those ideas necessary to higher forms of\\n', 'knowledge.19\\n', 'Finally, if consciousness is understood to be reflective, namely a higher-order\\n', 'perception, then Locke’s theory of consciousness also entails a regress of perceptions.\\n', '\\n', 'All thinking, for Locke, is conscious, and consciousness is thought to be some sort of\\n', 'perception of a perception. It follows that if consciousness bears a relation to ideas\\n', 'that produces more ideas, then any perception by consciousness results in a mental\\n', 'state that must itself be perceived by consciousness. This results in another mental\\n', 'state of which we must be conscious, and so on. In fact, in the II.xxvii.9 passage\\n', 'already noted Locke surprisingly seems to imply such a regress. When Locke says\\n', 'that “consciousness . . . is inseparable from thinking, and as it seems to me essential to\\n', 'it,” and then goes on to say that it is “impossible for any one to perceive without\\n', 'perceiving, that he does perceive,” it is clear that he must intend ‘perceiving’ to be\\n', 'synonymous with ‘consciousness.’ Therefore, if the way in which we perceive in being\\n', 'conscious is identified with the way in which we perceive in reflection, then the\\n', 'regress is unavoidable. It is hard to imagine Locke espousing such a view.\\n', '\\n', '18 LoLordo (2012) is an exception.

Arnauld makes the same point by explaining consciousness in terms of a réflexion virtuelle, as distinct from a réflexion expresse; that is to say in terms of the notion that ‘our thought or perception is essentially reflective on itself ’ (Arnauld, Des vrayes et des fausses idéees (1683), chapt.6, p. 46.) . . .

It would also be interesting to look at how Locke’s understanding of the relation of consciousness to perception stands up to what Sidney Shoemaker (1996: 224) has called the “perceptual model of self-knowledge.” That Locke’s view shares some features with later theories is not meant to be evidence for my interpretation of Locke’s conception of consciousness. I mention the similarities merely to help any reader familiar with contemporary work on consciousness (as well as those not so familiar) to get a better handle on what I see in Locke and the experience of our own thinking that he was attempting to capture in his employment of consciousness in various arguments in the Essay.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'I have proposed a reading of Locke that allows consciousness to be a perception of\\n', 'every perception (all thinking) without also being a source of ideas. But how does this\\n', 'interpretation square with the passages in II.i.25 and II.i.8? An advantage to reading\\n', 'Locke’s conception of consciousness in this way is that it solves the interpretive\\n', 'problem posed by these passages, because we no longer have to understand Locke\\n', 'as equating the “obscure Notions” in II.i.25 and the “floating Visions” in II.i.8 with\\n', 'ideas of reflection. Instead, they can be seen to refer to the conscious awareness\\n', 'internal to the perception of the ideas in question.31 The reason is that although\\n', 'Locke is clear that we are conscious of each and every mental state, he does not think\\n', 'that we reflect every time we have a mental state.32 He is very clear that young children\\n', 'have mental states but they do not engage in reflection (II.i.8). Therefore, the fact that\\n', 'we are never ignorant of our thinking need not mean that we must have reflected and\\n', 'thereby produced ideas of that thinking. Rather, we can be aware of ourselves as\\n', 'thinking (or better, that we are thinking) simply in virtue of consciousness. Moreover,\\n', 'as we saw in II.i.8, Locke thinks that mental operations “pass continually” in the minds\\n', 'of children; yet there are no clear and distinct ideas of those mental operations until\\n', '“the Understanding turns inwards upon it self ” and reflects on them. Locke’s point is\\n', 'that the impressions made by the operations of the mind about the ideas of sensation33\\n', 'it has do not yield ideas until the mind is capable of turning in on itself and reflecting.\\n', '\\n', 'Children, therefore, can have vague notions of their mental states—that they are\\n', 'having them—without having ideas of the nature of the mental operations involved in\\n', 'having those mental states. But if the “obscure Notions” in II.i.25 and the vague\\n', '“floating Visions” in II.i.8 are not ideas of mental operations due to reflection, then\\n', '31 See Scharp (2008: 38ff) for a different explanation of how we can have mental operations passing\\n', '“continually in the mind” yet not have ideas of reflection. He argues that Locke’s theory of reflection includes the existence of “mental impressions,” which are “mental entities” distinct from, yet the result of, mental operations. Thus, reflecting on (perception of ) “mental impressions” rather than reflecting on (perception of ) mental operations gives rise to ideas of reflection. He concludes that “the most plausible interpretation” is that when Locke claims that we are conscious (aware) of “what passes in a Man’s own Mind” (II.i.19), he does not mean to include mental operations, since we can have mental operations of which we are unaware. Our lack of awareness, namely the failure to perceive an idea of reflection, is due to our failure to reflect on the mental impression. “Otherwise,” argues Scharp (2008: 42), “if Locke allows mental operations to count as that which passes in a mind [as that which gives rise to the idea perceived], then he is committed to the claim that one can be conscious of a mental operation even if one is unaware of it (e.g., in cases where the mental operation does not give rise to an idea).” “This result,” continues Scharp\\n', '“seems counterintuitive.” I suggest, however, that if we understand that consciousness, for Locke, is an awareness of mental activity that does not give rise to ideas of reflection, then we can reconcile Locke’s claim that we are conscious of mental operations (all that passes in the mind), but we do not have\\n', 'corresponding ideas of reflection. And we can do it without attributing to Locke’s theory the existence of additional mental entities.\\n', '\\n', '32 McRae (1976: 34–5) takes this view: “[f]or both [Descartes and Locke] there are no thoughts and\\n', 'perceptions in the mind of which it is not conscious, although there may be much in the mind which is not reflected upon, thought about, or given any attention.”\\n', '33 Locke generally uses this somewhat misleading formulation (“about the ideas . . . it has”) to describe the relation between the mental operation (perception) and its object (ideas). See, for example, II.i.23 and II.ix.1.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'what are they? Perhaps we should see them as consciousness, which is a reflexive and\\n', 'self-referential (even if vague) awareness of ourselves as thinking internal to the\\n', 'perceptions of the ideas. The result is that II.i.25 and II.i.8 are not problematic for\\n', 'Locke at all. In fact, they are evidence that Locke can consistently claim that we can be\\n', 'conscious that we are thinking, that is “Consciousness is the perception of what passes\\n', 'in a man’s own mind” (II.i.19), and at the same time not be producing any new ideas.\\n', '\\n', '2.3.1 An objection and replies\\n', 'Locke tells us in I.i.8 that ‘idea’ is used “to express whatever is meant by Phantasm,\\n', 'Notion, Species, or whatever it is, which the Mind can be employ’d about in thinking.”\\n', 'Why, then, should we not understand the “obscure Notions” from II.i.25 as ideas of\\n', 'reflection? The first thing to say in reply is that II.i.25 is a very puzzling passage and\\n', 'therefore not the best one on which to hang an interpretation that contradicts some\\n', 'of Locke’s most closely held commitments such as the empiricist principle or the lack\\n', 'of reflective abilities in young children. Indeed, a closer reading of the passage from\\n', 'II.i.25 reveals the answer to the objection.34\\n', 'When Locke says that “the Operations of our minds will not let us be without, at\\n', 'least some obscure Notions of them” he is talking about our perceptions of ideas as\\n', 'the result of sensation. What becomes clear is that II.i.25 is not at all about reflection,\\n', 'but about sensation. The “obscure Notions” should be understood as consciousness\\n', 'of perceptions caused by the “Objects of our Senses [that] . . . obtrude their particular\\n', 'Ideas upon our minds” (II.i.25). And the fact that we are conscious of our perceptions\\n', 'involving sensations—namely, perceptions of ideas of sensation—does not imply\\n', 'that in being conscious of these perceptions we have additional ideas of mental\\n', 'operations, or ideas of reflection. Thus, the obtruding ideas are from objects of the\\n', 'senses, and what is unavoidable is our perception of them. But to perceive ideas of\\n', 'sensation is to think, and Locke is clear that all thinking is conscious. So, the idea\\n', 'of sensation is the object of the perception, while the “obscure Notions” constitute\\n', 'the consciousness that I am perceiving it. The “obscure Notions” are unavoidable,\\n', 'asserts Locke, because consciousness is internal to every perception; it is a reflexive\\n', 'awareness of myself as perceiving an idea. Therefore, it is impossible to be wholly\\n', 'ignorant—to have no awareness at all—of what we are doing when we think, namely,\\n', 'when we have those perceptions of ideas caused by external objects.35 Consciousness\\n', 'as intrinsic to the act of perception provides a fundamental first-personal experience\\n', '34 Again, the relevant passage reads: “For the Objects of our Senses, do, many of them, obtrude their particular Ideas upon our minds, whether we will or no: And the Operations of our minds, will not let us be without, at least some obscure Notions of them. No Man, can be wholly ignorant of what he does when he thinks. These simple Ideas, when offered to the mind, the Understanding can no more refuse to have, nor alter, when they are imprinted, nor blot them out, and make new ones in it self, than a mirror can refuse, alter, or obliterate the Images or Ideas, which, the Objects set before it, do therein produce” (II.i.25).\\n', '\\n', '35 See II.xix.1 for Locke’s claim that in sensation, ideas are furnished in the mind when the mental operation of perception is “annexed to any impression on the Body, made by an external Object.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'or sense that I am thinking.36 In the mirror analogy, then, Locke is saying that the\\n', 'ideas are the images in the mirror that I cannot help but see, and the “obscure Notions”\\n', 'constitute my awareness that I am looking in a mirror. Therefore, the “obscure\\n', 'Notions” are better understood not as ideas at all, but as consciousness that is\\n', 'constituent of every ordinary perception.\\n', '\\n', 'In order to account for the content of consciousness in a way consistent with the\\n', 'I.i.8 definition of ideas, in earlier work, I argued that we might see Locke as making\\n', 'a technical distinction between “ideas” and something like “notions.”37 I no longer\\n', 'think an argument or distinction of this kind is necessary or even warranted, for the\\n', 'content of consciousness need not be seen as an object of consciousness. In agreement\\n', 'with my analysis of consciousness as a reflexive constituent of any perception and with\\n', 'my analysis of the passage from II.i.25 in my earlier work, Thiel (2011) offers an\\n', 'amendment explaining why the content of consciousness need not be seen as con-\\n', 'flicting with Locke’s I.i.8 claim about ideas. Because consciousness is an intrinsic\\n', 'feature of perception, it need not be structurally identical to ordinary perceptions like\\n', 'sensation or reflection. Here is how Thiel (2011: 116) replies to the objection:\\n', 'But what about the objection that such a direct relation of consciousness to mental states and\\n', 'operations means that there are for Locke objects of thought and experience that are not\\n', 'ideas—which would contradict Locke’s thesis that ideas are the only objects of thought and\\n', 'experience? The problem with this objection is that it conceives of mental states and operations\\n', 'as objects of consciousness in the same way as such objects and states are objects of reflection. . . .\\n', '\\n', 'Locke thinks of the relationship between consciousness and thought in a different way.\\n', '\\n', 'Thinking and other mental operations are not ‘objects’ that are somehow separate from\\n', 'consciousness; rather they are characterized by an inherent reflexivity which Locke calls\\n', 'consciousness (rather than reflection). This reflexivity is a part of their nature as mental states and operations. Consciousness or inherent reflexivity is not a relation which may hold\\n', 'sometimes but not other times. One can distinguish conceptually between the content and\\n', 'the consciousness of thought, but this does not mean that the two aspects could be separated\\n', 'from each other in reality.\\n', '\\n', 'Even though consciousness contributes something to the experience of perceiving an\\n', 'idea, we need not see that contribution as an object of consciousness or something\\n', 'that is in reality separate from consciousness or what is already internal to the\\n', 'perception of an idea. Indeed, moving beyond Thiel’s helpful amendment now, we\\n', 'can see that Locke himself seems to state explicitly that he does not see the content of\\n', 'consciousness as the same as an idea:\\n', '36 We will see the significant role the first-personal subjective character of consciousness plays in other areas of Locke’s philosophy in subsequent chapters.\\n', '\\n', '37 Weinberg (2008: 29–30). Lähteenmäki (2008) lodges the general objection that an interpretation of the sort I have given includes mental content that is not an idea. LoLordo (2012: 113n11) objects (with merit, I think) to my use of a technical distinction in this earlier work to account for the content of consciousness. She tries to resolve the problem differently, which I take up in a moment.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'For since the Things, the Mind contemplates, are none of them, besides it self, present to the Understanding, ’tis necessary that something else, as a Sign or Representation of the thing it\\n', 'considers should be present to it: And these are Ideas.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.xxi.4, my emphasis in bold)\\n', 'Indeed, Locke tells us that when the mind is present to itself, it needs no intermediary\\n', '“Sign or Representation,” which is the same as an idea. Therefore, the interpretation\\n', 'runs afoul of neither Locke’s empiricist principle nor his I.i.8 definition of ideas. And\\n', 'implied by the interpretation is that perceptions of ideas are complex mental states in\\n', 'which we are conscious of more than the idea perceived.\\n', '\\n', 'There are still additional reasons for interpreting the disputed passage in II.i.25 to be\\n', 'about consciousness of our ideas of sensation rather than about reflection. One reason\\n', 'is that this passage is surrounded by references to ideas of sensation. Locke says,\\n', '“Objects of our Senses obtrude their particular Ideas upon our minds,” and although\\n', 'the next sentence is about operations of the mind, it is unlikely Locke is saying that we\\n', 'are engaging in any second-order thinking about those operations. Locke does not say\\n', 'that reflection will not let us be without obscure notions of our thinking; in fact there is\\n', 'no mention of reflection at all. Rather, he continues with additional references to\\n', '“Images and Ideas,” produced by “Objects set before [the Understanding].” Moreover,\\n', 'the sentence immediately following is an even clearer statement that the “Images and\\n', 'Ideas” produced are ideas of bodies: “As the Bodies that surround us do diversely affect\\n', 'our Organs, the mind is forced to receive Impressions; and cannot avoid the Perception\\n', 'of those Ideas that are annexed to them.” In other words, to have the ideas of sensation\\n', 'that are forced on us we must engage in perception, and we must be conscious of that\\n', 'perception; even the most rudimentary sensations entail thinking. But this does not\\n', 'mean there is present any other idea, namely, something produced owing to a second-\\n', 'order reflection, than what is involved in having a sensation. And so, that we are\\n', 'conscious that we are thinking (that we are perceiving ideas of sensation) need not\\n', 'mean that consciousness is a mental act additional to our thinking. Rather, conscious-\\n', 'ness can be a mental state internal to it.\\n', '\\n', 'Antonia LoLordo (2012: 112–20) tries to resolve the apparent tension in this passage\\n', 'by arguing that consciousness is the same mental operation as reflection. Thus, the\\n', '“obscure Notions” in II.i.25 can be due to reflection. Nevertheless, she argues, because\\n', 'we do not have ideas of reflection until we attend to what is given in consciousness, the\\n', '“obscure Notions” are not ideas.

I realize that an attribution of oddness, especially with respect to a fledgling\\n', 'notion like consciousness in the seventeenth century, is not the best argument. I suggest,\\n', 'though, that there is another problem that hits closer to home. LoLordo’s interpretation\\n', 'seems to have its own difficulty with how to account for the content of consciousness,\\n', 'for it runs afoul of a passage explaining the production of ideas of sensation. LoLordo\\n', '(2012: 113–20) argues that the difference between reflection as consciousness and\\n', 'reflection as a source of ideas is that the latter requires attention and results in lasting\\n', 'ideas of reflection, namely those that are retained in memory.

So\\n', 'that where-ever there is Sense, or Perception, there some Idea is actually produced, and present\\n', 'in the Understanding.\\n', '\\n', '(II.ix.4)\\n', 'Since attending to sensation is necessary to having ideas of sensation at all (even non-\\n', 'lasting ones), it cannot be the difference between whether or not we have ideas (of\\n', 'reflection) as opposed to something like “obscure Notions.” Therefore, it seems that\\n', 'LoLordo has not avoided the same problem that in earlier work I turned to a\\n', '“technical distinction” to solve. In a contribution published online in the Mod\\n', 'Squad Blog (June 2013), LoLordo replies to my objection by saying:\\n', 'I’m not sure about this: presumably attention, like lastingness, comes in degrees.

But given that Locke makes no\\n', 'mention of it, it might be better to side with an interpretation that is consistent with\\n', 'what the historical context does have an account of, even if that account is less than\\n', 'mature.

These sections describe the times,\\n', 'from infancy onward, at which children first come to have different sorts of ideas.\\n', '\\n', 'Children have vague perceptions of their own mental states before they are able to\\n', 'reflect.38 According to Locke, even a fetus, to some extent, perceives what goes on in\\n', 'its mind:\\n', 'That a Foetus in a Mother’s Womb, differs not much from a State of a Vegetable; but passes the\\n', 'greatest part of its time without Perception or Thought, doing very little, but sleep in a Place,\\n', 'where it needs not seek for Food, and is surrounded with a Liquor, always equally soft, and\\n', 'near of the same temper; where the Eyes have no Light, and the Ears so shut up, are not very\\n', 'susceptible of Sounds; and where there is little or no variety, or change of Objects, to move the\\n', 'senses.\\n', '\\n', '(II.I.21)\\n', 'The fact that a fetus passes most of its time without perception or thought suggests\\n', 'that it spends at least a small part of its time with perception or thought. The body,\\n', 'even of a fetus, although protected by the surrounding fluid, is passive to impressions\\n', 'made on it from the motions of external bodies. Perhaps the fetus can hear sounds or\\n', 'feel vibrations.

At the end of the passage Locke says that mental operations,\\n', '“which we being conscious of, and observing in ourselves,” furnish ideas to the\\n', 'understanding in reflection. Contrary to the interpretation I have offered, this part\\n', 'of the passage could be interpreted to mean that consciousness and reflection are the\\n', 'same operation. But the difficulty with this interpretation is that, again, one might\\n', '38 Although “’tis pretty late” before children have ideas of reflection, they do have “floating visions” of their own thinking (II.i.8 cited above), or what I think Locke also calls “obscure Notions.”\\n', '39 See II.i.9 and II.ix.1, where Locke equates ‘perception’ with ‘having ideas’ and with ‘thinking.’\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'think we run up against the problem that consciousness produces ideas, and therefore,\\n', 'we cannot reconcile the fact that Locke is clearly committed to the empiricist principle\\n', 'that ideas are produced only in sensation and reflection. So, instead, I suggest the\\n', 'passage is better interpreted in the following way: We are conscious that we are having\\n', 'mental operations prior to reflecting on them and thus producing ideas of reflection—\\n', 'this just is Locke’s view that we are conscious of all that passes in the mind—of all of\\n', 'our own thinking. And when we “observe in ourselves” (reflect on) those (conscious)\\n', 'operations, we end up perceiving (producing) ideas of reflection that have those\\n', 'conscious operations as their objects. Of course, we will also be conscious that we\\n', 'are having those acts of reflection. Remember that mental operations are always about\\n', 'ideas, and they are in the mind only as they involve ideas originating in sensation or\\n', 'reflection. So, every mental operation that passes in the mind is a perception of some\\n', 'sort, and because consciousness is an internal constituent of all perception, we are\\n', 'conscious that we are perceiving prior to reflecting on and having ideas of those\\n', 'mental operations. Therefore, this passage is actually consistent with the interpret-\\n', 'ation offered here: because being conscious is an intrinsic feature of perception and\\n', 'not structurally identical to perception, consciousness can be distinguished from\\n', 'reflection without contradicting Locke’s empiricist principle.\\n', '\\n', '2.4 The Relation Consciousness Bears to Perception\\n', 'We must acknowledge that there is an ambiguity in Locke’s uses of ‘perception’ and\\n', '‘perceiving.’ It is not an entirely settled matter whether Locke equates ‘perception’\\n', 'with ‘idea.’40 And it is not readily clear how to cash out the relation consciousness\\n', 'bears to perception. Although reflection and sensation are different in that having\\n', 'ideas of sensation involves perception as the result of bodily impressions and\\n', 'having ideas of reflection involves perception of mental operations, both sensation\\n', 'and reflection produce ideas. In contrast, consciousness does not produce ideas,\\n', 'but at the same time, consciousness, like sensation and reflection, has something\\n', 'to do with perception. So, how does Locke see the relation of consciousness to\\n', 'perception?\\n', '\\n', 'Locke does not devote a specific chapter to an explication of consciousness, but it\\n', 'is important to note that neither does he do so with sensation or reflection. He does,\\n', '40 Sometimes by ‘perception’ Locke seems to mean the act of perceiving and other times the idea\\n', 'produced (as the result of sensation or reflection). In the latter case, Locke will usually, if not always, use the upper-case ‘Perception.’ I think the confusion is exacerbated by interpreting Locke as meaning ‘idea’ by\\n', '‘perception’ without at the same time clarifying the difference between the bare mental act of perception and the idea produced in perceiving something, which is a conceptual distinction for Locke, not one we experience. See, for example, Yolton (1984: 88–94), who interprets Locke as using ‘perception’ and ‘idea’\\n', 'interchangeably. Chappell (1994: 27–8) argues that although Locke’s usage of the terms is sometimes ambiguous, he never means by ‘idea’ an act of perception as opposed to the object of such an act.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'however, treat all three in various places in II.i.

On this model, consciousness—as\\n', 'non-productive of ideas and as analogous to the points made about hunger—is\\n', 'best explained as something different from perception but internal to it, perhaps,\\n', 'as my experience of myself as thinking.42\\n', 'In many places, Locke seems to indicate that consciousness is self-consciousness or\\n', 'some sort of experience of our thinking as our own. The following examples make\\n', 'up just a few of many: “Every Man being conscious to himself, That he thinks . . .”\\n', '(II.i.1); “If the Soul doth think in a sleeping Man, without being conscious of it, I ask,\\n', 'whether, during such thinking, it has any Pleasure or Pain, or be capable of\\n', 'Happiness or Misery? . . . For to be happy or miserable without being conscious of\\n', 'it, seems to me utterly inconsistent and impossible” (II.i.11), and “For since\\n', 'consciousness always accompanies thinking, and ’tis that, that makes everyone to\\n', 'be, what he calls self; and thereby distinguishes himself from all other thinking\\n', 'things” (II.xxvii.9). Again, just because consciousness is not an independent\\n', 'mental act does not mean that consciousness is not a constituent of a more complex\\n', '42 Mackie (1976: 180–3) and Winkler (1998: 153ff) argue that, for Locke, in being conscious we are\\n', 'aware of an I thinking. Issues concerning the experience we have of ourselves in virtue of being conscious of perceptions of ideas are considered in chapters three, four, and five. It is also important to note that the early moderns who employ a notion of self-consciousness in addition to perception would have generally\\n', 'attributed the phenomenal quality of ideas to perception. Simmons (unpublished) explains, “It’s not that the early moderns had no concept answering to what we might describe as outer-directed object-consciousness. They just would not, by and large, have called it ‘consciousness.’ . . . [O]bject-consciousness would have gone by the name ‘perception.’ It’s true . . . that some philosophers of the period insist that perception entails consciousness in one way or another . . . so that you cannot have a perception without being conscious to yourself of the perception. But the perception and consciousness are not one and the same thing. What about the ‘what it’s like’ or phenomenology of object-perception so popular today? Some historians deny the early moderns had any such notion. I think it’s better simply to say that that’s not what consciousness is primarily about for them. There’s no reason to deny that the early moderns think object perception has a phenomenology; indeed there are good reasons to think they do. The fact that perception and consciousness are generally thought to co-occur, though, makes it difficult to know whether the phenomenology or what-it’s-like of object-perception is due to perception or due to our consciousness of it.”\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'mental act. Locke understands consciousness to consist in a special kind of awareness,\\n', 'perhaps one that provides some sort of grasp of ourselves and of our perceptions as\\n', 'ours. But in order to be consistent, it must be an awareness that is different from the\\n', 'perception involved in sensation and reflection.\\n', '\\n', 'At this point one might wonder about the implications of this interpretation for\\n', 'animals. Locke is clear that animals have perception: “This faculty of Perception, seems\\n', 'to be that, which puts the distinction betwixt the animal Kingdom, and the inferior parts\\n', 'of Nature” (II.ix.11). Plants, on the other hand do not have perception; the sensitivity of\\n', 'plants to the motions of other bodies, Locke says, “is all bare Mechanism” (II.ix.11). But\\n', 'if animals have perception, then on my interpretation they are conscious and even to\\n', 'some degree self-conscious. Although this might sound odd, Locke does not seem to\\n', 'think so. On the contrary, he seems to think that by and large the mental capacities of\\n', 'animals are like those of human beings, except in matter of degree:\\n', 'Perception, I believe, is, in some degree, in all sorts of Animals; though in some possibly, the\\n', 'Avenues, provided by Nature for the reception of Sensations, are so few, and the perception\\n', 'they are received with, so obscure and dull, that it comes extremely short of the quickness and\\n', 'variety of Sensations, which is in other Animals: but yet it is sufficient for, and wisely adapted\\n', 'to, the state and condition of that sort of Animals, who are thus made: So that the Wisdom and\\n', 'Goodness of the Maker plainly appears in all the Parts of this stupendious Fabrick, and all the\\n', 'several degrees and ranks of Creatures in it.\\n', '\\n', '(II.ix.12)\\n', 'Moreover, sensation is not the only kind of mental activity Locke assigns to other\\n', 'animals. He thinks they may also “compare” ideas, at least ideas having to do with\\n', '“sensible circumstances annexed to the Objects themselves” (II.xi.5), and although he\\n', 'doubts they are able to “compound” simple ideas into complex ones, animals are able\\n', 'to “take in, and retain together several Combinations of simple Ideas, as possibly the\\n', 'Shape, Smell, and Voice of his Master . . . [as] so many marks whereby he knows him”\\n', '(II.xi.7). Locke has similar doubts that animals are able to “enlarge” ideas. Where\\n', 'Locke draws the line, though, and where he thinks he actually can do more than\\n', 'merely conjecture, is when it comes to abstraction. Non-human animals have no\\n', 'capacity for general ideas, so any mental operations they do have will be about\\n', 'particular ideas: “If it may be doubted, Whether Beasts compound and enlarge their\\n', 'Ideas that way, to any degree: This, I think, I may be positive in, That the power of\\n', 'Abstracting is not at all in them; and that the having of general Ideas, is that which\\n', 'puts the perfect distinction betwixt Men and Brutes” (II.xi.10).\\n', '\\n', 'Importantly, when it comes to the mental activities of animals and the degree to\\n', 'which they mimic human beings, Locke is willing to assign more to animals than one\\n', 'might think. “For if they have any Ideas at all, and are not bare Machins (as some\\n', 'would have them) we cannot deny them to have some Reason” (II.xi.11). Exactly\\n', 'what Locke means by “reason” here is not exactly clear. Given the passages above,\\n', 'perhaps Locke, like Leibniz (1996: 50), thinks that animals are “sheer empirics,” able\\n', 'to draw inductive conclusions on the basis of the regularity of their collections of\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'simple ideas. At the very least we can see Locke’s attribution of some form of\\n', 'reasoning to animals as consistent with his critique of essentialism generally as well\\n', 'as with his critique of Descartes’s explanation of psychological activity as dependent\\n', 'on an immortal soul or substance. And if non-human animals have simple ideas of\\n', 'sensation and they are able to manipulate those ideas in various ways that add variety\\n', 'and richness to their mental lives, I suspect it is not a great leap to say that they are\\n', 'also (to varying degrees) conscious and so self-conscious. Remember that as I have\\n', 'described it, consciousness is pre-reflective. So being self-conscious on this view does\\n', 'not imply that non-human animals can have full-fledged ideas of themselves or a\\n', 'conceptual understanding of themselves. That would require reflection or abstrac-\\n', 'tion. Abstraction, Locke denies to animals. He does not say specifically that non-\\n', 'human animals do not reflect, but if reflection is not present in young children, it is\\n', 'reasonable to think it is not present in other animals. Moreover, I do not believe it is\\n', 'far-fetched to think that many animals have some sense of their thinking as their\\n', 'own—that they pre-reflectively assign whatever ideas they have to themselves.43\\n', 'Given Locke’s reluctance to rule out other kinds of more sophisticated mental activity\\n', 'in animals, it is in keeping that he would not rule out consciousness.\\n', '\\n', '2.5 Consciousness in Memory, Sensitive Knowledge,\\n', 'Personal Identity, and the Cogito\\n', 'There is, as we have seen, quite a bit of evidence that Locke must have been thinking\\n', 'of consciousness in the way I have been arguing.

As already noted, that this\\n', 'additional “annexed” perception is due to consciousness is supported by Locke’s I.iv.20\\n', 'assertion that “to remember is to perceive any thing with memory, or with a conscious-\\n', 'ness, that it was known or perceived before.” This strongly suggests that Locke intends\\n', 'consciousness to contribute something to the perception of an idea that has been\\n', 'revived from memory. Perhaps it contributes the awareness that I have perceived the\\n', 'idea before, which makes the difference in my experience between reviving an idea and\\n', 'other ways of perceiving an idea, say, my experience in sensing (perceiving an idea of\\n', 'sensation). In perceiving an idea I have had before, I am conscious that I am reviving an\\n', 'idea, namely experiencing it as remembered or as from memory.45\\n', 'As Locke continues in I.iv.20, without consciousness that the idea was in my mind\\n', 'before “whatever Idea comes into the mind is new, and not remembered: This\\n', 'consciousness of its having been in the mind before, being that, which distinguishes\\n', 'Remembring from all other ways of Thinking.” If consciousness is identical to\\n', 'ordinary perception, then either this difference cannot be explained or we must\\n', 'attribute to consciousness an idea as an object. Indeed, we would have to say that\\n', 'consciousness is a perception of the idea “had the idea before.” But this\\n', 'interpretation—that consciousness can have an idea as an object—results in the\\n', 'problem that Locke’s account of memory violates the empiricist principle. Moreover,\\n', 'as mentioned at the outset, the I.iv.20 discussion of memory is in the service of an\\n', 'argument against innate ideas, namely against the view that we have ideas that do not\\n', 'originate in sensation and reflection. So, Locke cannot be thinking that the feature that\\n', 'allows for an awareness that makes a memory a memory rather than an idea of\\n', 'sensation is a kind of perception that has an idea as an object, since there is no\\n', 'explanation where that idea originates consistent with Locke’s empiricism. On the\\n', 'view that consciousness is a special kind of awareness internal to ordinary perception\\n', 'we have an account that avoids these problems altogether.

We cannot but believe that\\n', 'our perceptions of sensation have their sources in actually existing objects because, as\\n', 'Locke explains,\\n', '45 As already noted, in II.i.10 Locke seems to equate consciousness with sensibility, and as argued in chapter one, in Locke’s time consciousness was thought to involve a “sentiment interiour.” Indeed, Locke countenanced Coste’s French translation of consciousness as ‘sentiment,’ ‘sentir,’ and even ‘sentir intérieurement.’ This last example is employed to capture what Locke meant in I.iv.20, when he says “Whenever memory brings any idea into actual view, it is with a consciousness [sentir intérieurement] that it had been there before.” In each case, though, Coste is emphasizing the interior nature of the experience of our own thinking.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'we are provided with an Evidence, that puts us past doubting: For I ask anyone, Whether he be\\n', 'not invincibly conscious to himself of a different Perception, when he looks on the Sun by day,\\n', 'and thinks on it by night; when he actually tastes Wormwood, or smells a Rose, or only thinks\\n', 'on that Savour, or Odour?

Moreover, we have seen that Locke’s understanding of\\n', 'consciousness is not only interesting for its value internal to Locke’s philosophy, but\\n', '\\n', '47 I offer promissory notes to make fully explicit in chapters four and five how we achieve unity of consciousness as well as how (and to what extent) we have knowledge of ourselves as temporally extended.\\n', '48 How exactly an awareness of ourselves as thinking results in knowing our own existence is somewhat more complex.

In the next\\n', 'chapter, we move to Locke’s account of knowledge to see how the role of conscious-\\n', 'ness as internal to the perception of an idea helps show how we can have knowledge\\n', 'of own ideas and of ourselves consistent with Locke’s propositional account of\\n', 'knowledge. We will also see how Locke has consciousness playing a crucial role in\\n', 'his account of sensitive knowledge (of the existence of external objects). In parts I, II,\\n', 'and III, we will see how the complexity of our perceptual states results in the\\n', 'agreements perceived in each case. And once we do, what appear to be puzzling\\n', 'inconsistencies in those accounts are reconciled.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '3 Consciousness in Locke’s Theory of Knowledge\\n', '\\n', 'In this chapter, I argue that consciousness plays an essential role in Locke’s theory of\\n', 'knowledge, more specifically in how we know particular things (ideas, our own existence,\\n', 'and the existence of external objects). What brings these various forms of knowledge\\n', 'together is that they all seem to be cases in which Locke describes the knowledge we have\\n', 'as resulting from the perception of a single idea. But such a description appears\\n', 'problematic, for Locke’s definition of knowledge generally seems to require the percep-\\n', 'tion of more than one idea. Fortunately, however, the difficulty is resolved once we\\n', 'appreciate the role consciousness, as a constituent of a more complex perceptual state,\\n', 'plays in each instance of knowledge. To show better how my interpretation of con-\\n', 'sciousness permits a unified account of each of these cases of knowing a particular thing,\\n', 'I have structured the chapter somewhat unusually. After a brief introduction to Locke’s\\n', 'theory of knowledge, the chapter is divided into three parts.

In spite of Locke’s confidence in\\n', 'the project, there is a good deal of scholarly controversy over exactly where he actually\\n', 'draws the line between knowledge and opinion. We see this especially in relation to\\n', 'Locke’s account of “sensitive” knowledge (of external world objects), which is the focus\\n', 'of parts II and III of this chapter. But first, in this introduction to the chapter, I want to\\n', 'give a brief account of those aspects of Locke’s theories of knowledge and belief insofar\\n', 'as they, and the role consciousness plays in them, are the subject of the entire chapter.\\n', '\\n', 'Following his “Historical, plain Method,” Locke first considers the origin of ideas,\\n', '“which a Man observes, and is conscious to himself that he has in his Mind; and the ways\\n', 'whereby the Understanding comes to be furnished with them” (I.i.3). A thorough\\n', 'investigation of the experience of our own thinking reveals no justification for the claim\\n', 'that we have innate ideas. Whether or not Locke has considered all the ways in which\\n', 'ideas can be innate is a good question.1 In spite of the scholarship’s answer to this query,\\n', 'however, certainly Locke thinks he has sufficiently argued the case, and so draws the\\n', 'conclusion that all ideas must have their origin in experience: in sensation and reflection.\\n', '\\n', 'Locke then proceeds to give a compositional account of how we come by all of our ideas\\n', 'via a host of perceptual acts, which he also calls “mental operations.”2 Locke sees the mind\\n', 'as composed of two faculties or powers: the understanding and the will. The understand-\\n', 'ing is the power of perception, and the will is the power of volition. Therefore, acts of the\\n', 'understanding (sensing, reflecting, discerning, comparing, knowing, believing, etc.) are all\\n', 'perceptions.3 Moreover, as already argued, all perceptions include self-consciousness, and\\n', 'as will become clear in a moment, all perceptions include ideas.\\n', '\\n', 'It is a controversial question what is Locke’s notion of an idea, and he was not\\n', 'particularly careful in his talk about ideas.4 Sometimes he seems to conflate ideas\\n', '1 See Atherton (1998), Rickless (2007), and De Rosa (forthcoming) for analyses of Locke’s opponents and success in his arguments against innate ideas.\\n', '\\n', '2 See Bolton (2007) for an enlightening discussion of both the structural and compositional features of both simple and complex ideas.\\n', '\\n', '3 “The two great and principle Actions of the Mind, which are most frequently considered, and which are so frequent, that every one that pleases, may take notice of ’em in himself, are these two: Perception, or Thinking, and Volition, or Willing. The Power of Thinking is called the Understanding, and the Power of Volition is called the Will, and these two Powers or Abilities in the Mind are denominated Faculties. Of some of the Modes of these simple Ideas of Reflection, such as are Remembrance, Discerning, Reasoning, Judging, Knowledge, Faith, etc. I shall have occasion to speak hereafter” (II.vi.2). Ideas of reflection are ideas of mental operations, which confirms that Locke thinks all acts of the understanding (mental operations) are perceptions.\\n', '\\n', '4 Chappell (1994) has a good survey of the various views on the nature of Lockean ideas.

When questioned about it by Stillingfleet, he\\n', 'responds,\\n', 'So that supposing ideas real spiritual things ever so much, if they are neither substances nor\\n', 'modes, let them be what they will, I am no more instructed in their nature, than when I am told\\n', 'they are perceptions, such as I find them. (Works, ix.220)\\n', 'In spite of Locke’s lack of concern, it is probably helpful to clarify the way in which\\n', 'I interpret Lockean ideas. Locke seems to state pretty clearly that ideas are some sort\\n', 'of mental objects. Textual support for this conclusion includes I.i.8, where Locke says\\n', 'about ‘idea,’ “It being that Term, which, I think, serves best to stand for whatsoever is\\n', 'the Object of the Understanding when a Man thinks”; II.viii.8, where we find,\\n', '“Whatsoever the Mind perceives in it self, or is the immediate object of Perception,\\n', 'Thought, or Understanding”; and IV.xxi.4, where we have, “For since the Things, the\\n', 'Mind contemplates, are none of them, besides it self, present to the Understanding,\\n', '’tis necessary that something else, as a Sign or Representation of the thing it\\n', 'considers, should be present to it.” Passages like these lead us to think that ideas\\n', 'are mental objects that mediate between us and an external world.\\n', '\\n', 'Indeed, Locke can be seen to have what is called a “representational theory of\\n', 'perception,” according to which the immediate objects of our acts of perception are\\n', 'ideas.7 And, as I have argued, perceptions of ideas also include consciousness.\\n', '\\n', 'Because consciousness is an intrinsic feature of all acts of perception, we are\\n', 'conscious of all of our ideas—that we are perceiving them.

Those interpreting Locke as having a direct theory of perception include Yolton (1984) and Lennon (2004).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'connexion and agreement, or disagreement and repugnancy of any of our Ideas . . .\\n', '\\n', 'Where this Perception is, there is Knowledge, and where it is not, there, though we\\n', 'may fancy, guess, or believe, yet we always come short of Knowledge” (IV.i.2).8 As the\\n', 'result of having ideas in the mind, we are able to perceive (know) how they agree or\\n', 'disagree. Locke can be seen to confirm his definition of knowledge in his claims that\\n', 'all knowledge is propositional. In II.xxxiii.19, for example, we find, “our Knowledge,\\n', 'which all consists in Propositions,” and again in the Correspondence with Stillingfleet\\n', '(Locke, 1823, iv: 357), Locke says, “Everything which we either know or believe, is\\n', 'some proposition.” In addition, in the IV.v.1 definition of truth, Locke is clear that\\n', 'the “joining or separating of Signs” whose agreement or disagreement constitutes\\n', 'truth “is what by another name, we call Proposition.”9\\n', 'Agreements (or disagreements) of ideas, the perception of which constitutes\\n', 'knowledge, are arranged into four categories: “1. Identity, or Diversity. 2. Relation,\\n', '3. Co-existence, or necessary connexion, [and] 4. Real Existence” (IV.i.3). “Identity,”\\n', 'Locke seems to limit to knowing our own ideas as they are in the mind. It is to\\n', 'perceive that each idea agrees with itself, although what Locke seems really to mean is\\n', 'that we know of each idea “what it is” (IV.i.4) or that “it is as [we] perceive it to be”\\n', '(IV.ii.1). Knowing that two ideas are “diverse” is to know that “one is not the other”\\n', '(IV.i.4). “Relation” is a very broad category of agreements comprising everything that\\n', 'does not fall into one of the other three categories. Locke usually turns to mathem-\\n', 'atical relations as examples, but we can include knowing any sort of relation between\\n', 'our ideas.10 Knowing an agreement of “necessary co-existence” in the same subject is\\n', 'a type of knowledge particularly about substances—that some quality of a substance\\n', 'as represented by an idea is necessarily joined by some other quality as represented by\\n', 'a different idea (IV.i.6). Finally, we know only three “real existences”: the existence of\\n', 'ourselves, of God, and of particular external objects (IV.i.7).\\n', '\\n', 'Although when push comes to shove Locke thinks that all four categories of\\n', 'agreements are relations, he tells us that some agreements are so “peculiar . . . that\\n', 'they deserve well to be considered under distinct heads, and not under Relation in\\n', 'general, since they are such different grounds of affirmation and negation” (IV.i.7).\\n', '\\n', 'That is, Locke could have said that to know an agreement of ideas is simply to know a\\n', 'relation of ideas and left it at that. But then what I take to be a meaningful\\n', '“peculiarity . . . of the different grounds of affirmation and negation” would have\\n', '8 Hereafter, in most cases, for ease, I will shorten the definition of knowledge to “the perception of an agreement of ideas.”\\n', '9 For some of the more recent secondary literature espousing this view, see, for example, Mattern\\n', '(1978), Soles (1985), Newman (2004, 2007), Rickless (2008), and Nagel (forthcoming) for interpretations of Locke’s theory of knowledge and especially of sensitive knowledge that emphasize the propositional nature of knowledge.\\n', '\\n', '10 Locke himself says very little specifically about this category: “The next sort of Agreement, or Disagreement, the Mind perceives in any of its Ideas, may, I think, be called Relative, and is nothing but the Perception of the Relation between any two Ideas, of what kind soever, whether Substances, Modes, or any other” (IV.i.5).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'been glossed over. Locke mentions only identity and co-existence as having this\\n', 'peculiarity. As with the agreement of identity, I also take the agreement of real\\n', 'existence with respect to knowing our own existence and knowing the existence of\\n', 'external objects to be somewhat peculiar. One, but not the only, reason to think that\\n', 'knowing particular real existences is like knowing a particular idea is that Locke\\n', 'refers to ideas as particular “real existences”: “Every Man’s Reasoning and Know-\\n', 'ledge, is only about the Ideas existing in his own Mind, which are truly, every one of\\n', 'them, particular Existences: and our Knowledge and reasoning about other Things, is\\n', 'only as they correspond with those our particular Ideas” (IV.xvii.8).\\n', '\\n', 'The peculiarity consists, as Locke says, in the “grounds of affirmation and neg-\\n', 'ation,” that is, in the way in which the agreement is constituted and perceived. Having\\n', 'any knowledge, whether peculiar or not, for Locke, is the result of perceiving agreeing\\n', 'ideas. This means that ideas are in the mind simultaneously. Examples of having\\n', 'simultaneous ideas in the mind include, but are not limited to, cases of the compos-\\n', 'ition of simple ideas to create complex ones, cases of reflection, and cases of compar-\\n', 'ing or juxtaposing ideas. In the mental operation of “COMPOSITION” the mind “puts\\n', 'together several of those simple ones [ideas] it has received from Sensation and\\n', 'Reflection, and combines them into complex ones” (II.xi.6). “Reflection,” Locke\\n', 'explains, “is the Perception of the Operations of our own Minds within us, as it is\\n', 'employed about the Ideas it has got” (II.i.4), which implies that the reflective percep-\\n', 'tion is in the mind at the same time as the perception that is its object. Additionally, in\\n', 'comparing ideas “the Mind so considers one thing, that it does, as it were, bring it to,\\n', 'and set it by another, and carry its view from one t’other” (II.xxv.1). In all three cases,\\n', 'ideas are perceived in the mind simultaneously, that is, there is a complex perceptual\\n', 'state.11 And when there are ideas in the mind simultaneously and there are agree-\\n', 'ments between those ideas, we can know those agreements.12 We might say that those\\n', 'agreements are presented to us in consciousness. That is, insofar we know an\\n', 'agreement of ideas, we are conscious of ourselves as knowing it.\\n', '\\n', 'My interpretation of Locke’s theory of knowledge includes two claims: one is\\n', 'novel; the other is not. First, the non-novel claim: knowing an agreement intuitively\\n', '(or non-inferentially) need not require a mental act in addition to the complex\\n', 'perceptual state wherein we find the agreeing ideas. That is, we can have\\n', 'non-inferential knowledge (perceive an agreement) just in virtue of attending to\\n', 'whatever constitutes the agreement. There is no need for an additional mental act.13\\n', '11 This is not also to say that Locke has a sufficient answer (or any answer at all) to the question of how ideas are psychologically bound together in the mind. Here, to my knowledge, he is in the same boat as all the early moderns.\\n', '\\n', '12 But this does not mean that we will always perceive an agreement when there is one, for more ideas may be required to show the agreement or make it evident to us. That would be the difference between intuitive and demonstrative knowledge (IV.ii.1–2).\\n', '\\n', '13 Ayers (1991, I: 107ff, 1997: 157–88) and Owen (1999: ch. 3, 2007: 410ff) interpret Locke as having what might be called a “one-act” theory of knowledge, which has some difficult consequences for Locke.\\n', '\\n', 'Ott (2004: 45–8), Newman (2007: 321), and van der Schaar (2008: 340) argue against this interpretation,\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'As I have argued, perceptions of ideas are complex mental states that include, at the\\n', 'very least, a perceptual act, an idea perceived, and the consciousness of myself as\\n', 'perceiving. And when there are simultaneous perceptions of ideas, there is an even\\n', 'more complex mental state in which we are conscious that we are perceiving multiple\\n', 'ideas. Furthermore, if there are ideas in my mind simultaneously, then, without any\\n', 'additional act of the mind, we can know intuitively (be conscious of) any agreements\\n', 'therein.14 I will have more to say about this in part I of this chapter. In addition, that\\n', 'we have simultaneous ideas and we are conscious we are perceiving each idea results\\n', 'in unity of consciousness in perceiving more than one idea. I will have more to\\n', 'say about the unity of consciousness and the work it does for Locke in chapters\\n', 'four and five.\\n', '\\n', 'Now for the novel claim: I will argue that there are other aspects of mental\\n', 'content that can play a role in constituting an agreement of ideas. My proposal is\\n', 'that we can see the peculiarity in cases of knowing an idea, knowing our own\\n', 'existence, and knowing the existence of an external object as due to two factors.\\n', '\\n', 'First, part of the peculiarity is due to the fact that in these cases my knowledge is of\\n', 'a particular individual thing. That is, I know a particular truth as opposed to a\\n', 'general one. Although I think these instances of knowledge are consistent with the\\n', 'general definition of knowledge, it is not so easy to see how. Second, and relatedly,\\n', 'part of the peculiarity in knowing the agreements constituting our knowledge of the\\n', 'identity of an idea, of our own existence, and of the existence of external objects is\\n', 'due to the complexity of our perceptual states. For example, knowing an idea and\\n', 'knowing that we exist depend on the first-personal character of consciousness as a\\n', 'constituent element in a more complex mental state resulting from the perception\\n', 'of an idea. Because this first-personal character is itself an element of the complex\\n', 'mental state, it can play a role in constituting an agreement. We will also see that\\n', 'Locke has consciousness playing a role in the agreement in an instance of knowing\\n', 'the existence of something external to me, but it is different from what we find in\\n', 'the other two cases. But here, too, it is because of the complexity of our perceptual\\n', 'states that we are able to perceive the agreement constituting what Locke calls\\n', '“sensitive knowledge” of the existence of particular finite beings. In none of the\\n', 'cases, though, must the account violate Locke’s definition of knowledge as the\\n', 'perception of an agreement of ideas.\\n', '\\n', 'One might wonder why I am not considering the “peculiarity” in knowing agree-\\n', 'ments of “necessary co-existence in the same subject.” First, according to Locke, we\\n', 'have virtually no knowledge of this category except insofar as particular collections of\\n', 'defending a “proto-Fregean” account in order to avoid some of these difficulties. Marušić (2014: 263–78) provides a recent very compelling argument against the “proto-Fregean” view and in defense of the “one-act” view.\\n', '\\n', '14 Nagel (forthcoming) puts it this way: “Even to entertain an agreement of ideas that is intuitively knowable is already to know it intuitively.”\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'simple ideas make up our complex ideas of substances. If this is the extent of our\\n', 'knowledge, then it is not hard to make the case that in perceiving a complex idea, say,\\n', 'of gold, I am conscious of the simple ideas composing it. But knowledge of necessary\\n', 'connection is much more than that. It is knowing that there is a necessary dependence\\n', 'of one idea on another, which requires knowing the metaphysical relation between\\n', 'insensible bodies and the metaphysical dependence of ideas on the powers of those\\n', 'related bodies to produce them. Locke is clear that such knowledge is very scarce:\\n', 'This, how weighty and considerable a part soever of Humane Science, is yet very narrow, and\\n', 'scarce any at all. The reason whereof is that the simple Ideas whereof our complex Ideas of\\n', 'Substances are made up, are, for the most part such, as carry with them, in their own Nature,\\n', 'no visible necessary connexion, or inconsistency with any other simple Ideas, whose\\n', 'co-existence with them we would inform ourselves about.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.iii.10)\\n', 'In vain, therefore, shall we endeavour to discover by our Ideas, (the only true way of certain\\n', 'and universal knowledge,) what other Ideas are to be constantly joined with that of our\\n', 'complex Idea of any Substance: since we neither know the real Constitution of the minute\\n', 'Parts, on which their Qualities do depend; nor, did we know them, could we discover any\\n', 'necessary connexion between them, and any of the secondary Qualities: which is necessary to\\n', 'be done, before we can certainly know their necessary co-existence.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.iii.14)\\n', 'Locke mentions two exceptions, but the necessary connection “reaches very little farther\\n', 'than our Experience. Indeed, some few of the primary Qualities have a necessary\\n', 'dependence, and visible connexion one with another, as Figure necessarily supposes\\n', 'Extension, receiving or communicating Motion by impulse, supposes Solidity”\\n', '(IV.iii.14). Locke does not provide any further description of these instances of intuitively\\n', 'knowing a necessary co-existence. I suspect when he says we know it only by experience\\n', 'he means that when we perceive an idea of figure, we always also perceive an idea of\\n', 'extension. We cannot perceive the one idea without the other; perceiving their co-\\n', 'existence is psychologically unavoidable. Perhaps this is some of the peculiarity of the\\n', 'way of perceiving the agreement. If so, then, as we will see, these two cases of knowing a\\n', 'necessary co-existence, namely the psychological unavoidability of the two ideas simul-\\n', 'taneously together in the mind and thus the perception of their agreement, is fully\\n', 'compatible with my interpretation of how we have the other peculiar forms of knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'What is quite unusual, though, about Locke’s theory of knowledge, I think, is that he\\n', 'allows three degrees of certainty of knowledge: intuitive, demonstrative, and sensitive.\\n', '\\n', 'Intuitive knowledge is an immediate perception of an agreement, where demonstration\\n', 'requires an intervening idea to show the agreement. Demonstrative knowledge results\\n', 'from a chain of reasoning—a proof or a demonstration—in which each step is known\\n', 'intuitively. Moreover, although “where-ever the Mind perceives the Agreement or\\n', 'Disagreement of any Ideas,” says Locke, “there be certain knowledge” (IV.ii.2), not\\n', 'all perceptions of agreements carry the same degree of certainty. Demonstrative\\n', 'knowledge is a little less certain than intuitive knowledge, and sensitive knowledge\\n', '(of the existence of external objects) falls somewhere in between demonstrative\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'knowledge and probability.15 Although Descartes, too, saw demonstrative knowledge\\n', 'as less certain than what we know by intuition, when it comes to the certainty of\\n', 'sensitive knowledge, Locke separates himself from every other seventeenth-century\\n', 'thinker I can of. Attributions of certain knowledge are generally reserved only for\\n', 'intuition and demonstration, what we might call “knowledge proper.” Given the\\n', 'Cartesian skeptical concerns, Locke’s representational theory of perception, and his\\n', 'goal of discovering the limits of human understanding, it is surprising that he would\\n', 'want to include representations of external world objects as providing “sensitive”\\n', 'knowledge. More naturally one would conclude, as some do, that what Locke calls\\n', 'sensitive knowledge is really only a high degree of probability. In part III of this chapter,\\n', 'I will argue that Locke’s inclusion of sensitive knowledge as having a degree of certainty\\n', 'appropriate to his understanding of knowledge is consistent with his reasons for why\\n', 'there is a difference in the certainty of intuitive and demonstrative knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'Let me also add that Locke’s account of probability, although having parallel features,\\n', 'is significantly different from his account of knowledge. For Locke, ideas may agree, in\\n', 'which case there is truth, but unless we actually perceive them to agree there is no\\n', 'knowledge. Therefore, in having knowledge it is the perception of the agreement that\\n', 'counts. If we do not perceive the agreement (either because we are unable to for lack of\\n', 'intervening ideas or there is not one), then the best we can do is some degree of assent to\\n', 'a probable judgment. “Judgment,” says Locke, “. . . is the putting Ideas together, or\\n', 'separating them from one another in the Mind, when their certain Agreement or\\n', 'Disagreement is not perceived, but presumed to be so” (IV.xiv.4). Probable judgment\\n', 'is taking there to be an agreement (or disagreement) when we do not actually perceive\\n', 'one. Moreover, there is no direct analogue between the degrees of certainty of know-\\n', 'ledge and the degrees of assent to a probable judgment, for all cases of probability are\\n', 'cases of proofs. We do not immediately “presume” ideas to agree; there is always an\\n', 'intervening idea doing some work to bolster the presumption. “That which makes me\\n', 'believe,” Locke says, “is something extraneous to the thing I believe; something not\\n', 'evidently joined on both sides to, and so not manifestly shewing the Agreement or\\n', 'Disagreement of those Ideas, that are under consideration” (IV.xv.3).16 In other words,\\n', 'probable judgments are always inferential, which I am interpreting as the result of a\\n', 'mediating idea (or proposition). Only two kinds of grounds or justification are used in\\n', 'probabilistic reasoning: “First, The conformity of any thing with our own Knowledge,\\n', 'Observation, and Experience. Secondly, The testimony of others, vouching their\\n', '15 This is not an uncontroversial claim. In defense of his claim that sensitive knowledge, for Locke, is not really knowledge but a very high degree of probability, Rickless (forthcoming) argues that demonstrative knowledge is not less certain than intuitive knowledge.\\n', '\\n', '16 See also IV.xv.1: “As Demonstration is the shewing the Agreement, or Disagreement of two Ideas, by the intervention of one or more Proofs, which have a constant, immutable, and visible connexion one with another: so Probability is nothing but the appearance of such an Agreement, or Disagreement, by the intervention of Proofs, whose connexion is not constant and immutable, or at least is not perceived to be so, but is, or appears for the most part to be so, and enough to induce the Mind to judge the Proposition to be true, or false, rather then the contrary.”\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'Observation and Experience” (IV.xv.4). The intervening idea justifying the presump-\\n', 'tion of an agreement is our own past experience or testimony of the experience of\\n', 'others. Factors attesting to the reliability of the testimony of another, things like the\\n', 'integrity of the testifier, the skill of the witness, whether there is any contrary experience,\\n', 'etc., justify the degree to which we assent to the belief. And degrees of belief range from\\n', 'assurance and confidence to conjecture, wavering, doubt, distrust, and disbelief\\n', '(IV.xvi.6–9).\\n', '\\n', 'Importantly also, for Locke, there is an involuntary aspect to both belief and\\n', 'knowledge—something over which we have no control. When we perceive an\\n', 'agreement, we do not choose to be certain, nor do we voluntarily assign ourselves\\n', 'a degree of assent given the evidence for a probable judgment. We just see the\\n', 'agreement (the truth) and experience certainty; in probable judgment we just\\n', 'naturally presume the proposition to be true to a degree warranted by how we are\\n', 'affected by the evidence.17 This is not to say that we have no epistemic responsibility\\n', 'when it comes to what we believe. We do, and in fact Locke’s project to discover the\\n', 'limits of knowledge would in some ways be in vain were we to have no control at all\\n', 'over what we believe. Our responsibility is to seek knowledge (the perception of\\n', 'agreeing or disagreeing ideas), and when we fail to achieve it, to recognize that much\\n', 'of what we claim to know really only reaches various levels of probability depending\\n', 'on the reliability of the evidence.18\\n', 'Why then would he think we have knowledge of the external world, especially since\\n', 'drawing the proper boundary between knowledge and probability is Locke’s stated\\n', 'task in the Essay? And what does all of this have to do with consciousness? I suggest\\n', 'that Locke’s “Historical, plain Method” of providing an account of the facts of\\n', 'experience leads him to his controversial conclusions concerning the status of sensi-\\n', 'tive knowledge. I argue that insofar as it reveals to us the experience of our own\\n', 'thinking, Locke’s introspective method is key to understanding how we have know-\\n', 'ledge of our own ideas and ourselves (the topics of part I) and of external objects (the\\n', 'topic of parts II and III). Understanding the important role of our experience in\\n', 'perceiving ideas, as it pertains to Locke’s claims concerning how we have these various\\n', 'forms of knowledge, is the task of the entire chapter. Consciousness, as providing\\n', 'some of that experience, as we will see, plays a significant role in each case. What is\\n', 'more, appreciating the complexity of our mental states and that consciousness is a\\n', 'part of that complexity leads to an integrated account of all three of these instances of\\n', 'knowing particular things. Let us turn to those arguments now.\\n', '\\n', '17 For different views of how this happens, see Owen (2007: 407) and Wolterstorff (1996: 61).\\n', '\\n', '18 Wolterstorff (1996: 60–86) has a nice discussion of Locke’s commitment to epistemic responsibility.\\n', '\\n', 'See also Bolton (2008).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'PART I\\n', 'Knowing our own Ideas\\n', '(and Ourselves)\\n', 'As we have just seen, at the beginning of Book IV, Of Knowledge and Probability,\\n', 'Locke defines knowledge as “nothing but the perception of the connexion and\\n', 'agreement, or disagreement and repugnancy of any of our Ideas” (IV.i.1). There are\\n', 'four categories of agreement: first, there is “Identity, or Diversity,” which is the\\n', 'agreement of an idea with itself, or its disagreement with any other idea (IV.i.4);\\n', 'second, there is “Co-existence . . . in the same Subject,” which is the agreement ideas\\n', 'of qualities have that are necessarily found together in complex ideas of substances\\n', '(IV.1.6); third, there is “Real Existence,” which is knowledge of the existence of\\n', 'ourselves, God, and particular finite things (external objects) (IV.iii.21); and finally,\\n', 'there is “relation in general,” which is a catch-all category for those agreements that\\n', 'do not fall under the specific definitions of the other three (IV.i.5, IV.i.7). For\\n', 'example, mathematical relations fall into this last group, as do agreements of\\n', 'resemblance or size.

In addition,\\n', 'he distinguishes this sort of knowledge from general maxims or propositions that\\n', 'express an identity relation.

In addition, we will see that\\n', 'the same account leads to an explanation of how we know our own existence, namely\\n', 'Locke’s version of the cogito argument.

One exception is Lex Newman (2007: 328n18). I will have more to say about Newman’s suggestion shortly.\\n', '\\n', '21 There is a significant amount of literature on “immunity to error through misidentification” (IEM), which began with Wittgenstein’s (1958) distinction in The Blue Book, between degrees of first-person privilege depending on whether in any self-ascription the pronoun ‘I’ or ‘my’ is used as subject or object.\\n', '\\n', 'The issue was taken up in a paper by Shoemaker (1968), which spawned the contemporary discussion.\\n', '\\n', 'More generally, epistemic states that are IEM are a subset of infallible states.

For Locke, when I know an idea, I am immune to error relative to my own first-personal identification of the idea.

The Perception\\n', 'of Ideas in our Minds, 2. The Perception of the signification of Signs. 3. The Perception of\\n', 'the Connexion or Repugnancy, Agreement or Disagreement, that there is between any of\\n', 'our Ideas.\\n', '\\n', 'Perceiving ideas, the objector continues, is foundational, while knowing the identity\\n', 'of an idea consists in a proposition in which there are two tokens of a single idea type.\\n', '\\n', 'So, there is no problem with how one knows the identity of an idea, and there is no\\n', 'need for perceptions of ideas to be propositional.\\n', '\\n', 'But this objection misses the target. First, in the very next sentence of the above\\n', 'passage, Locke states this: “All these [powers of perception] are attributed to the\\n', 'Understanding, or perceptive Power, though it be the two latter only that use allows\\n', 'us to say we understand” (II.xxi.5). Yet, if Locke thinks we have knowledge of\\n', 'individual ideas, and he includes it in Book IV (Of Knowledge in General), then he\\n', 'must be thinking that when we perceive an idea, we understand something consti-\\n', 'tuting knowledge. So, I do not think that Locke means the power of perceiving ideas\\n', 'to be fully capturing his Book IV discussion of knowing an idea. Second, Locke\\n', 'cannot be thinking that what we understand when we know an idea is an analytic\\n', 'proposition (two tokens of a single idea type), for he devotes an entire chapter to\\n', 'explaining why these sorts of propositions are “trivial” as opposed to “instructive.”\\n', 'I take it that when Locke says we “understand” something, he means it to be\\n', 'something substantive.23 Third, Locke claims that we know the identity of “each”\\n', '22 Locke (1975) also points to the importance of the knowledge of our own ideas at the very beginning of the Essay, in the “Epistle to the Reader.” He makes note of a clarification to the new edition. He thinks this change “was necessary to mention. Because it ran through the whole Book, and is of consequence to be rightly understood” (p. 12). Locke says he prefers to use the terms “determined” and “determinate,” rather than “clear and distinct,” to describe having ideas in the mind: “By those denominations, I mean some object in the Mind, and consequently determined, i.e. such as it is there seen and perceived to be” (p. 13).\\n', '\\n', 'Locke explains that ideas are determined prior to being denominated, which is consistent with the passage above in which Locke describes confusion as not having to do with anything inherent in the perception (or knowledge) of an idea, but with the failure of terms (denominations) to distinguish a particular idea sufficiently from another similar to it.\\n', '\\n', '23 Bolton (1992: 415) argues that, for Locke, we know our ideas (we are not ignorant of them) in the following three ways: “(1) A person who perceives an idea . . . [is not] ignorant of what distinguishes it from one or more other ideas. (2) A person . . . [is not] mistaken about the features [the idea] is perceived to have.\\n', '\\n', 'Or, (3) a person . . . [is not] uncertain or mistaken as to what the idea represents (i.e. the rule for its\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'idea individually “at first view.” It is the “first Act of the Mind, when it has any . . .\\n', '\\n', 'Ideas . . . to know each what it is” (IV.i.4). But if we know the identity of an individual\\n', 'idea upon the very first perception of it (“at first view”), and the agreement consists in\\n', 'a proposition in which there are two tokens of an idea type, then there is a problem of\\n', 'accounting for the second idea token agreeing to the original idea perceived.24\\n', 'Therefore, knowing an idea seems not to be the result of perceiving two tokens of\\n', 'an idea type, and there is some need for an account of Locke’s claim that we have\\n', 'intuitive knowledge of individual ideas.\\n', '\\n', 'We should also be clear, as was mentioned earlier, that knowing the identity of an\\n', 'idea is not the result of already knowing a general principle of identity. Locke asserts,\\n', 'the Mind clearly and infallibly perceives each Idea to agree with it self, and to be what it is; . . . at first view, by its natural power of Perception and Distinction. And though Men of Art have\\n', 'reduced this into those general Rules, What is, is; and it is impossible for the same thing to be,\\n', 'and not to be, for ready application in all cases, wherein there may be occasion to reflect on it;\\n', 'yet it is certain that the first exercise of this Faculty is about particular Ideas. (IV.i.4)\\n', 'Consider again that Locke is drawing a distinction between knowing our own ideas\\n', 'individually by the “first exercise of this Faculty [‘of Perception and Distinction’]”\\n', 'and an act of reason (as Locke uses the term) or reflection by which we would\\n', 'recognize that the individual identity fits under a general principle concerning all\\n', 'ideas. Not only does Locke think that we have intuitive knowledge of particular ideas,\\n', 'but the view I am advocating does not see Locke as requiring reason, reflection, or\\n', 'any other perceptual act for intuitive knowledge at all. Rather, non-inferential forms\\n', 'of knowledge can be conveyed as part of first-order perceptual acts. From this we can\\n', 'conclude, first, that I know that any idea in my mind is the idea it is, and, second, that\\n', 'the reason why I know the identity is in virtue of that particular perceptual state itself\\n', 'and not because of anything else. We can then move on to answer these next two\\n', 'questions concerning our knowledge of our own ideas: How can we know these\\n', 'agreements as the result of perceiving an idea, and what is the nature of the\\n', 'proposition known? From what I have been arguing, crucial to the story is that\\n', 'perceptions of ideas are complex mental states with constituent elements.\\n', '\\n', 'extension).” Bolton then concentrates on establishing (3) in terms of Locke’s theory of how ideas represent things external to us. As will be clear soon, I will distinguish the knowledge in (3) from what we have in (1) and (2) and then focus on the latter. I am also arguing that consistent with Locke’s other commitments, our knowledge of our own ideas (what we have in (1) and (2)) is propositional, although I do not think Bolton would deny this. See also Ayers (1991: 98), who acknowledges that “on Locke’s view the perception of the identity or diversity of ideas reduces to the ‘discerning’ or distinguishing of a single idea or two different ideas.” He continues, “Since we cannot have ideas without distinguishing them, the potentiality for a kind of propositional knowledge is bound up with the very having of ideas.” In a comparison of Locke with Descartes, Loeb (1981: 54) claims that for both “we have intuitive knowledge of propositions about the content of our present sensory states.” I take Loeb to be saying that knowing our own ideas, for Locke, is a form of substantive propositional knowledge.\\n', '\\n', '24 In section 3.I.4, I consider and reject ways in which an analytic proposition consisting in two tokens of a type can be constructed “at first sight” given the perception of an individual idea.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The task, then, is to provide an account of how we have propositional knowledge\\n', 'of individual ideas consistent with Locke’s theory of knowledge generally, and in so\\n', 'doing also reveal the important role consciousness plays. As mentioned earlier, there\\n', 'has been almost no treatment of this issue in the scholarship. There are, however, two\\n', 'exceptions. Lex Newman (2007), in a footnote responds to this passage in Locke:\\n', 'Every one finds in himself, that he knows the Ideas he has; That he knows also, when any one is\\n', 'in his Understanding, and what it is; And that when more than one are there he knows them\\n', 'distinctly and unconfusedly one from another. Which always being so, (it being impossible but\\n', 'that he should perceive what he perceives,) he can never be in doubt when any Idea is in his\\n', 'Mind, that it is there, and is that Idea it is; and that two distinct Ideas, when they are in his\\n', 'Mind, are there, and are not one and the same Idea.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.vii.4)\\n', 'Here Locke distinguishes three different kinds of knowledge falling under the category\\n', 'of identity and diversity: (1) we know “when any one [idea] is in the understanding,”\\n', 'which Locke glosses as “that it is there”; (2) we know “what it [the idea] is,” namely that\\n', 'it “is the Idea it is”; and (3) when more than one idea is in the mind, we know that they\\n', '“are not one and the same idea.” Since we are concerned only with knowing the\\n', 'identity of an idea and not its diversity from other ideas, I will consider only (1) and\\n', '(2): knowing that an idea is in the mind and knowing what the idea is. Here is how\\n', 'Newman explains those agreements:\\n', 'Locke writes that a man “can never be in doubt when any Idea is in his Mind, that it is there,”\\n', 'explaining this by appeal to “it being impossible but that he should perceive what he perceives”\\n', '(E IV.vii.4). But this leaves unclear how such truths count as agreements between ideas. An\\n', 'explanation is suggested in connection with his Book II discussion of perception: “What\\n', 'Perception is, everyone will know better by reflecting on what he does himself, when he sees,\\n', 'hears, feels, etc.”—that is, “reflects on what passes in his own Mind” (E II.ix.2: 143). This\\n', 'implies that the general idea of perception subsumes all manner of occurring ideas, thereby\\n', 'suggesting how to formulate the relevant agreement. Suppose a sensation of red is occurring in\\n', 'my mind. To know that that idea is presently occurring—that it is in the present contents of\\n', 'consciousness—is to perceive an agreement between that idea and my general idea of percep-\\n', 'tion. (To know, in addition, that the occurring sensation is of red is to perceive, in addition, an agreement between that idea of sensation and my general idea of red.)25\\n', 'Newman argues that the agreement in knowing (1) is between the idea (any idea) and\\n', 'a general idea of perception, and in perceiving that agreement we know “that an idea\\n', 'is presently occurring” (my emphasis). Knowing (2) “that the occurring sensation is\\n', 'of red,” namely what the idea is, Newman argues, consists in perceiving an agreement\\n', 'between the “idea of sensation and my general idea of red.” Although I concur that\\n', 'when we know an idea, we seem to know both that the idea is in the mind and what\\n', 'the idea is (as stated in the IV.vii.4 passage), here are some reasons to be suspicious\\n', 'that the agreements are as Newman describes them. First, Newman’s view requires\\n', '25 Newman (2007: 328, n 18).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'that we already have several general or abstract ideas before we can have knowledge\\n', 'of the identity of an idea. So, prior to knowing the identity of my idea red, I must have\\n', 'a general idea of perception, and I must have a general idea of red. But this conflicts\\n', 'with Locke’s claim in the rest of the passage from IV.vii.4 that we know the identity of\\n', 'each and every idea just upon perceiving it—that it is “the first Act of the Mind, . . . to\\n', 'know every one of its Ideas by it self.” We find virtually the same statement in IV.i.4:\\n', 'First, as to the first sort of agreement or disagreement, viz. identity or diversity. It is the first act of the mind, when it has any sentiments or ideas at all, to perceive its ideas; and so far as it\\n', 'perceives them, to know each what it is, and thereby also to perceive their difference, and that\\n', 'one is not another. This is so absolutely necessary, that without it there could be no knowledge,\\n', 'no reasoning, no imagination, no distinct thoughts at all.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.i.4)\\n', 'Clearly implied here is that we know the identity of an idea, say, the idea red, prior to\\n', 'having generated an abstract idea of red or even an abstract idea of perception. In\\n', 'addition, abstracting ideas requires a higher-order mental act that is absent in young\\n', 'children. Newman’s interpretation would lead to the odd conclusion that young\\n', 'children have no first-order knowledge that they are having ideas, nor what those\\n', 'ideas are. Or to accommodate that children do have knowledge of their own ideas, it\\n', 'would be suggestive of there being innate ideas of perception and of red that are\\n', 'already in the mind to be compared. But we know what Locke has to say about innate\\n', 'ideas. This, on top of Locke’s clear statement that “the first Act of the Mind, . . . to\\n', 'know every one of its Ideas by it self,” leads me to conclude that Locke must have\\n', 'something different in mind.\\n', '\\n', 'Another exception is Nicholas Wolterstorff (1996: 20–1), who argues that con-\\n', 'trary to his “official” position, Locke “actually” held the view that we know our own\\n', 'ideas, mental acts, and perhaps ourselves as constituents of facts prior to proposi-\\n', 'tions. “Locke’s official doctrine [is] that, from among all the facts that there are,\\n', 'those of which one is directly aware consist of ideas-in-relation; it was also his\\n', 'doctrine that propositions consist of ideas-in-relation” (1996: 20). But “Locke’s\\n', 'actual view, as distinguished from his official view, was that the facts available to\\n', 'one for one’s ‘perception’ have not only one’s own ideas as their constituents but\\n', 'also one’s mental acts, and perhaps one’s self ” (1996: 21). Like Wolterstorff, I take\\n', 'it that internal to a complex perceptual state are the perceptual act and the idea (i.e.\\n', '\\n', 'the perception of an idea) and the consciousness of myself as perceiving it.\\n', '\\n', 'Nevertheless, I am defending Locke’s official view. I take Locke at his word that\\n', 'knowing an idea is a species of knowledge, which consists in knowing an agree-\\n', 'ment. And consistent with Newman, I will argue that knowing the identity of an\\n', 'idea is to know two agreements—one consisting in the knowledge that the idea is in\\n', 'the mind and one consisting in the knowledge what the idea is. Since all knowledge\\n', 'is propositional, when we know our own ideas, we know a true proposition, in this\\n', 'case a proposition expressing both agreements. Similarly, when we know our own\\n', 'existence, we know a true proposition.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'In what follows, I will provide a textually justified and philosophically adequate\\n', 'account of how we have knowledge of individual ideas and of ourselves. In order to\\n', 'distinguish the representational function of ideas sufficiently from the knowledge we\\n', 'have of our own ideas, I provide, first, a brief explanation of how ideas are represen-\\n', 'tational. In section 3.I.2, I give a textual argument for why we should see Locke as\\n', 'having some forms of knowledge conveyed as the result of other perceptual acts.\\n', '\\n', 'Here we see that, for Locke, knowing that ideas are as we perceive them, namely\\n', 'knowing the agreements therein, is the result of the complexity involved in perceiv-\\n', 'ing ideas.

Many have\\n', 'argued for what can be roughly called an “externalist” theory of representation in\\n', 'Locke.26 Without delving into the details of different interpretations, the general\\n', 'claim is that what we are thinking about when we have sensory ideas in our minds is\\n', 'the external causes of those ideas.

Moreover, that one person’s idea yellow appears not the\\n', 'same as another’s does not imply that anyone has a false idea. Such a view about the\\n', 'way in which ideas represent should lead us to think that what we are thinking about\\n', 'when we are having simple ideas is the causes of those ideas and not the intrinsic\\n', '(apparent) features of the ideas. Thus, ideas can be seen as something like “blank\\n', 'effects” of their causes.27 But if what we are thinking about when we have ideas is the\\n', 'causes of the ideas and not the ideas themselves, then it seems difficult to make sense\\n', 'of Locke’s claims that we know our own ideas.

I will allay this worry in section 3.I.6.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'sensory idea implies, or perhaps marks, the existence of a particular cause. If we think\\n', 'again about the inverted spectrum case, when I see the yellow of the marigold and\\n', 'you see blue, “the object of [my] thought is the same as [yours] but the content of\\n', '[my] thought is not.”29\\n', 'Distinguishing the contents from the objects of thinking fits very well with my view\\n', 'that perceptions of ideas are complex mental states in which we experience different\\n', 'forms of mental content, namely ways of experiencing the object thought about: there\\n', 'are the intrinsic apparent features of the idea and the “first-personal” character in being\\n', 'conscious of myself as perceiving it. Knowing an idea is the result of the relation\\n', 'between the different contents of my thinking when I perceive an idea, not with the\\n', 'object thought about. Such a view is consistent with having knowledge on the basis of\\n', 'the introspectable features of what is presented in the mind without having to give up\\n', 'that ideas also represent their causes. As we will see, the perception of an idea has a\\n', 'structural complexity resulting in intuitive knowledge of the idea: the agreement is\\n', 'presented to us in virtue of our experience of the introspectable features of perceptions\\n', 'of ideas.30 Perceptions of ideas, for Locke, turn out to be propositional states.\\n', '\\n', 'My interpretation of how we have knowledge of our own ideas can explain not only\\n', 'what we know when we know an idea, but also how we can perceive an idea and in so\\n', 'perceiving it know a true proposition expressing an agreement.

That the account may prove to be somewhat\\n', 'peculiar, Locke has already given us fair warning. Perceptions of ideas are propositional\\n', '29 Forrai (2005: 46). Forrai mentions his agreement with Yolton (1984), which I take to be that Locke has an “act-content . . . analysis of perception.” “Idea” is simply Locke’s term for “cognitive content”\\n', '(Yolton 1975: 384). Chappell (1994: 33) concurs, saying of Yolton, his “point here is well-taken: many philosophers since Yolton have found the notion of ‘content’ to be helpful in the effort to comprehend human mentality. In current work in philosophical psychology, the term most frequently used to convey the same notion is ‘intentional object.’” Neither Chappell, nor, I think, Forrai, nor I agree with Yolton that Locke thinks acts of perception are the same as ideas. Hoffman (2002: 174), in what I think is a terrific article, argues that in some early moderns (in this case Descartes and Arnauld) the line between\\n', 'representationalism and direct realism is not drawn where we, perhaps, think it is: “A theory of perception that held that we perceive external objects by perceiving the content intrinsic to acts of perception would still be representationalist, because that intrinsic content would be serving as an intermediate object.”\\n', '30 As we will see in section 3.I.5, the structural complexity of the perception of an idea also results in knowledge of our own existence. I suggest that Locke’s account of our intuitive knowledge of necessary coexistence also has some similar features:\\n', 'Our knowledge in all these Enquiries, reaches very little farther than our Experience. Indeed,\\n', 'some few of the primary qualities have a necessary dependence, and visible connection one\\n', 'with another, as Figure necessarily supposes Extension, receiving or communicating\\n', 'Motion by impulse, supposes Solidity. But though these, and perhaps some others of our\\n', 'Ideas have: yet there are so few of them, that have a visible Connexion one with another, that\\n', 'we can by Intuition or Demonstration, discover the co-existence of very few of the Qualities\\n', 'are to be found united in Substances.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.iii.14)\\n', 'Here Locke seems to be claiming that the psychological unavoidability of the simultaneity of the ideas in the mind, “their visible connection with one another,” namely our experience of the structural complexity of the mental state, is what results in intuitive knowledge of necessary co-existence.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'in that they have structured content the perception of which constitutes knowing an idea.\\n', '\\n', 'One might wonder whether and why anything more needs to be said.

Two pieces of this puzzle have already been\\n', 'mentioned. First, for Locke, perceptions of ideas are complex propositional states in\\n', 'which there is more than just the idea perceived. Second, in order to have intuitive\\n', 'knowledge all that is required is that the constituents of the agreement are before the\\n', 'mind. In this section, I provide argumentation establishing this latter point more\\n', 'clearly, especially as it pertains to knowing our ideas. Once we see that agreements\\n', 'can be known without having to engage in an additional mental act, the door is opened\\n', 'to understanding how we can have knowledge as internal to the perception of an idea.\\n', '\\n', 'To make the case that we have knowledge as the result of the complexity in\\n', 'perceiving an idea, let us start with Locke’s first statement concerning knowing the\\n', 'identity of an idea:\\n', 'First, As to the first sort of Agreement or Disagreement, viz. Identity, or Diversity. ’Tis the first Act of the Mind, when it has any Sentiments or Ideas at all, to perceive its Ideas; and so far as it perceives them, to know each what it is, and thereby also to perceive their difference, and that\\n', 'one is not another. This is so absolutely necessary, that without it there could be no Knowledge,\\n', 'no Reasoning, no Imagination, no distinct Thoughts at all.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.i.4)\\n', 'It is important, first, to acknowledge that in this passage Locke appears to be saying\\n', 'that I have intuitive knowledge of individual ideas. Insofar as I perceive an idea\\n', 'I “know each what it is,” and by knowing the identity of each idea, “thereby” I am able\\n', 'to know that it is diverse from any other.31 And if I could not be sure of the ideas\\n', 'I perceive, then I would not be able to know anything else.32 Similarly, in the passage\\n', '31 See also Gibson (1960: 24): “Each idea must be at once perceived to be what it is, and at the same time distinguished from all other ideas.” Of course, this does not mean that I do not also perceive the diversity of two ideas when explicitly compared.\\n', '\\n', '32 I suppose our earlier objector could dig in her heels by reading this passage as saying that knowing the identity of an idea is knowing that two idea tokens of a particular type are identical, which requires first perceiving the ideas. But that would be to deny that knowing an idea is anything more than merely having that idea in my mind. Moreover, it would be to deny a plausible reading of the passage in which Locke is equating knowing the identity of the idea with perceiving the idea. And only once I know the idea, its identity, can I know a difference between ideas.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'from IV.vii.4, Locke says that it is the first act of the mind “to know every one of its\\n', 'Ideas by it self.” Already we seem to have come across something quite surprising,\\n', 'namely that Locke seems to have room for knowledge that is an agreement, but\\n', 'somehow the agreement is perceived as a part of the perception of the idea. Note,\\n', 'however, that in IV.ix.3, a passage cited earlier in chapter two, Locke states that we\\n', 'have another form of intuitive knowledge on the basis of perceiving an idea: “In every\\n', 'Act of Sensation, Reasoning, or Thinking,” he says, “we are conscious to our selves of\\n', 'our own being; and in this Matter, come not short of the highest degree of Certainty.”\\n', 'So there is clear textual evidence in the Essay that Locke thinks we have at least two\\n', 'forms of knowledge (of our own ideas and of our own existence) conveyed with\\n', 'whatever is given in the perception of any idea.33\\n', 'As additional support, let me draw attention to Locke’s Book IV explanation of the\\n', 'different categories of agreements constituting knowledge. There, Locke seems to\\n', 'equate intuitively knowing our ideas with the mental operation of distinguishing\\n', 'ideas:\\n', 'the mind clearly and infallibly perceives each idea to agree with itself, and to be what it is; and all distinct ideas to disagree, i.e. the one not to be the other: and this it does without pains, labour, or deduction; but at first view by its natural power of Perception and Distinction. (IV.i.2)\\n', 'Here, Locke states that just in virtue of the mind’s natural power to perceive and\\n', 'distinguish ideas, we are able to know “clearly and infallibly,” their identity—that\\n', 'they are as we perceive them. Distinguishing ideas falls under the mental faculty of\\n', '“discerning,” which Locke describes in Book II as the mind “distinguishing between\\n', 'the several Ideas it has” (II.xi.1).34 In these passages, then, Locke is saying that\\n', 'discerning an idea, or what is the same, perceiving a distinct idea (distinguishing\\n', 'it) entails also knowing it intuitively. The explanation, I suggest, is that when\\n', 'I perceive (distinguish) an idea, I know that it is the idea it is—I know that there is\\n', 'an idea in my mind, and I know what it is. The intuitive knowledge of an idea is\\n', 'conveyed as a part of the perceptual act of distinguishing it. But distinguishing an\\n', 'idea is no more than to perceive it, which results in knowing it.\\n', '\\n', 'More support for this claim is found in Locke’s II.xxix.5 analysis of clear and\\n', 'distinct ideas, since here Locke states that all ideas are perceived distinctly.\\n', '\\n', '33 This does not preclude that owing to the kind of the idea perceived, we could know even more.\\n', '\\n', '34 See also Aaron (1971: 140), who asserts that “discerning is itself an instance of knowing.” He\\n', 'continues, “If the reader compares the account given of intuition in IV.ii.1 with that of discerning in II.xi.1, he will see that discerning is one instance of intuition.” Gibson (1960: 143) notes that the identity of an idea involves the “ability to identify and discriminate the contents of our ideas.” Ayers (1991: I, 98) acknowledges that “on Locke’s view the perception of the identity or diversity of ideas reduces to the\\n', '‘discerning’ or distinguishing of a single idea or two different ideas.” He continues, “Since we cannot have ideas without distinguishing them, the potentiality for a kind of propositional knowledge is bound up with the very having of ideas.”\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'For let an Idea be as it will, it can be no other but such as the Mind perceives it to be; and that very perception, sufficiently distinguishes it from all other Ideas, which cannot be other, i.e.\\n', '\\n', 'different, without being perceived to be so. No Idea therefore can be undistinguishable from\\n', 'another, from which it ought to be different, unless you would have it different from itself. (II.xxix.5)\\n', '\\n', 'Note that Locke’s use of the phrase “[an idea] can be no other but such as the Mind\\n', 'perceives it to be” to describe having a distinct idea is almost identical to the way in\\n', 'which he describes the intuitive knowledge of our own ideas in IV.ii.1. There he says,\\n', '“For a Man cannot conceive himself capable of a greater Certainty, than to know that\\n', 'any Idea in his Mind is such, as he perceives it to be.” So, in four different chapters,\\n', 'two from Book II and two from Book IV, we find Locke equating perceiving an idea,\\n', 'perceiving it distinctly, and knowing its identity. This is strong textual evidence that\\n', 'whatever components constituting the agreement in knowing an idea are somehow\\n', 'present in the mind along with the idea, such that in perceiving it I also have\\n', 'knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'In fact, knowing my own ideas and my own existence is not the only kind of\\n', 'intuitive knowledge conveyed as a part of simply having the constituents of the\\n', 'agreement in the mind. Locke confirms, in this next passage, that we know agree-\\n', 'ments just in virtue of comparing ideas, which I take to mean merely having them\\n', 'juxtaposed:\\n', 'For in this [intuitive knowledge] the mind is at no pains of proving or examining, but perceives\\n', 'the truth as the eye doth light, only by being directed towards it. Thus the mind perceives that\\n', 'white is not black, that a circle is not a triangle, that three are more than two and equal to one\\n', 'and two. Such kinds of truths the mind perceives at the first sight of the ideas together, by bare\\n', 'intuition; without the intervention of any other idea: and this kind of knowledge is the clearest\\n', 'and most certain that human frailty is capable of.  (IV.ii.1)\\n', '\\n', 'Here Locke explains that just in virtue of having the ideas together in the mind I can\\n', 'know an agreement. The mind perceives the truth at “first sight of the ideas together.”\\n', 'And it seems that Locke is saying that it is this perception that constitutes intuitive\\n', 'knowledge. Therefore, intuitively knowing agreements or disagreements (as\\n', 'described in the passage above) seems not to require a mental act in addition to\\n', 'perceiving the ideas together in the mind. Similarly, it seems reasonable to conclude\\n', 'that having intuitive knowledge of our own ideas requires nothing more than having\\n', 'whatever constitutes that agreement together in the mind.35 Owen (1999: 47) states\\n', '35 Locke does not say much about comparing ideas except for its role in how we come to have ideas of relations: “The comparing them one with another, in respect of Extent, Degrees, Time, Place, or any other Circumstances, is another operation of the mind about its Ideas, and is that upon which depends all that large tribe of Ideas, comprehended under Relation” (II.xi.4). In the chapter on ideas of relations, however, Locke describes the comparing of ideas as when “the Mind thus brings two things together, and, as it were, takes a view of them at once” (II.xxv.1). Regardless of whether comparison in this case is voluntary or not, the important part of generating anything new as the result of it is that the relevant ideas are juxtaposed (appear together) in the mind.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'the case this way: “there is no distinction between perceiving the agreement or\\n', 'disagreement of ideas, forming the proposition, and knowing it to be true.” On the\\n', 'basis of the textual evidence, I am taking a further step by suggesting that in the case\\n', 'of intuitive knowledge there is no gap between comparing or distinguishing (per-\\n', 'ceiving) ideas, perceiving the agreement, forming the proposition, and knowing it to\\n', 'be true.36 That is, having intuitive knowledge need not require anything other than\\n', 'having the agreeing elements juxtaposed in the mind.37 And if so, then as long as the\\n', 'constituents of the agreement perceived in knowing the identity of an idea are a part\\n', 'of the structural complexity in perceiving an idea, I can have that knowledge as a part\\n', 'of that complex mental state.\\n', '\\n', '3.I.3 Knowledge of an Idea as Propositional\\n', '\\n', 'Locke does not specifically consider the nature of the proposition expressing the\\n', 'identity of an idea. Nevertheless, despite their self-evidence, I think we can rule out\\n', 'analytic or what he calls “trifling” propositions. That Locke has little use for these\\n', 'sorts of propositions is quite clear:\\n', 'What is this more than trifling with Words? It is but like a Monkey shifting his Oyster from\\n', 'one hand to the other; and had he had but Words, might, no doubt, have said, Oyster in right\\n', 'hand is Subject, and Oyster in left hand is Predicate: and so might have made a self-evident\\n', 'Proposition of Oyster, i.e. Oyster is Oyster; and yet, with all this, not have been one whit the\\n', 'wiser, or more knowing. (IV.vii.3)\\n', '\\n', 'Surely, our knowledge of our own ideas cannot be the result of tautological proposi-\\n', 'tions that impart nothing substantive, for Locke considers this kind of (propositional)\\n', 'knowledge foundational. That is, intuitively knowing each idea “by itself,” says Locke,\\n', 'is foundational not only to perceiving tautologies but also to perceiving any other\\n', 'agreement or disagreement of ideas:\\n', '\\n', 'For, First, the immediate perception of the agreement or disagreement of Identity, being\\n', 'founded in the Mind’s having distinct Ideas, this affords us as many self-evident Propositions,\\n', 'as we have distinct Ideas. Every one that has any Knowledge at all, has, as the Foundation of it\\n', 'various and distinct Ideas: And it is the first Act of the Mind, (without which, it can never be\\n', 'capable of any Knowledge,) to know every one of its Ideas by itself, and distinguish it from\\n', 'others. (IV.vii.4)\\n', '\\n', '36 Marušić (2014: 266) seems to be taking this view when she says, “Affirming, I propose, is a way of combining ideas because it is taking ideas to stand in some relation. Taking ideas to stand in some relation is, in effect, a way of connecting or combining them. Similarly, denying is a way of separating ideas because it is taking them not to stand in some relation.”\\n', '37 This is not to preclude that having knowledge might require some degree of attention. Locke often equates attending to our ideas with “taking notice” of them, which is necessary for having both ideas of sensation (II.ix.4) and ideas of reflection (II.i.4, II.i.7). I will have more to say (as well as text to cite) about the role it plays in knowing our own ideas at the end of section 3.I.4.\\n', '\\n', 'Locke reiterates this distinction between the foundational work done in knowing an\\n', 'idea and the vacuity of self-evident identity (or “trifling”) propositions, which\\n', 'contribute nothing to the advancement of knowledge:\\n', 'These [propositions like ‘white is white’] obviously, and at first blush, appear to contain no\\n', 'instruction in them. For when we affirm the same Term of itself, whether it be barely verbal, or\\n', 'whether it contains any clear and real Idea, it shows us nothing, but what we must certainly\\n', 'know before, whether such a Proposition be either made by, or proposed to us. (IV.viii.2)\\n', '\\n', 'Here, we can see Locke distinguishing between an initial foundational intuitive know-\\n', 'ledge of our own ideas and a subsequent, derivative, and trivial assertion, whether\\n', 'mental or verbal, of what we already know.38 Therefore, the intuitive knowledge we\\n', 'have of each and every individual idea is a precondition for all other knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'If the propositional knowledge conveyed in perceiving an idea is not analytic, then\\n', 'what is it? Well, first, let us see how Locke usually expresses our knowledge of the\\n', 'identity of an idea. He uses several propositions to describe what we know. For\\n', 'example, sometimes we find “the idea is the idea it is.” This one, I suggest, is not as\\n', 'helpful, for it resembles the kind of trifling propositions that Locke has little use for.\\n', '\\n', 'But often he says, “the idea is as I am perceiving it to be” or “the idea is what it is.” In\\n', 'the “Epistle to the Reader” we find Locke’s very similar description: “I mean some\\n', 'object in the Mind, and consequently determined, i.e. such as it is there seen and\\n', 'perceived to be” (1975: 13).\\n', '\\n', 'Second, I suggest that according to Locke’s taxonomy, we can see this proposition\\n', 'as expressing a “real mental truth,” namely the agreement expressed is such that its\\n', 'constituents signify real things “capable of having an Existence in Nature” (II.v.8).\\n', '\\n', 'Moreover, Locke’s contrast class to “real” mental truths consists in propositions in\\n', 'which the signifiers stand for fictional things, like “Harpies and Centaurs” (IV.v.7).\\n', '\\n', 'In the mental truth, “the idea is as I am perceiving it to be,” the things signified\\n', '(perhaps the idea and consciousness) are real things and not fictions like harpies and\\n', 'centaurs. The existing idea stands for itself—a real thing certainly, but not a real thing\\n', 'outside (or in addition to and represented by) the idea.39 Likewise, my experience\\n', '38 Importantly, Locke is placing the standard for knowledge in the mental faculty itself rather than in, say, a syllogistic model of reasoning, which is not uncommon among some of the early moderns. Owen\\n', '(1999: 4), argues that characteristic of Descartes, Locke, and Hume is the rejection of any importance given to syllogistic reasoning: “The focus is not the validity of argument so much as the activity of the faculty of reason (ideas), and the activities performed by the faculty on those materials.” Owen then cites Hatfield (1997: 22): “The early modern rejection of Aristotelian logic can then be seen as reflecting a negative assessment of the fit between the syllogism and logic considered as an art of reasoning that refines the use of the cognitive faculties.”\\n', '39 In further distinguishing truth from falsehood Locke states, “And so far as these Ideas, thus marked by Sounds, agree to their Archetypes, so far only is the Truth real” (IV.v.9). This should remind us of Locke’s II.xxx classification of ideas as “real” when they agree to their “archetypes.” I suggest that Locke’s understanding of the agreement of an idea to itself is similar to an agreement of an idea of a mode or relation to its archetype: “These Ideas, being themselves Archetypes, cannot differ from their Archetypes, and so cannot be chimerical, unless anyone will jumble together in them inconsistent Ideas” (II.xxx.4). of an I perceiving signifies itself—consciousness as internal to the perception of\\n', 'the idea.40\\n', 'Third, we can look to Locke’s II.xxxii analysis of the truth and falsity of ideas for\\n', 'more help. There, Locke distinguishes two ways in which we can speak of ideas as\\n', 'true or false. On the one hand, ideas can be true or false in the “ordinary Accepta-\\n', 'tion,” which is when we refer an idea to something else such that we can affirm or\\n', 'deny conformity of the idea to that thing. The three most common cases are the\\n', 'reference of an idea in my mind to an idea in another person’s mind, the reference of\\n', 'an idea to some “real existence,” and the reference of an idea to a “real Constitution,\\n', 'and essence of any thing” (II.xxxii.5). On the other hand, and this is the one we are\\n', 'interested in, an idea can be true in what Locke calls the “metaphysical sense of the\\n', 'Word Truth”:\\n', 'as all other Things, that any way exist, are said to be true; i.e. really to be such as they exist.\\n', '\\n', 'Though in Things called true even in that Sense, there is, perhaps a secret reference to our\\n', 'Ideas, look’d upon as the Standards of that Truth, which amounts to a mental Proposition,\\n', 'though it be usually not taken notice of. (II.xxxii.2)\\n', '\\n', 'This locution, that an idea is “really to be such as it exists,” is remarkably similar to\\n', 'those propositions Locke uses (just mentioned above) to describe what we know\\n', 'when we have intuitive knowledge of the identity of an idea. Perhaps it is fair to say\\n', 'that when I perceive an idea, it is “metaphysically” true, and I know it intuitively.\\n', '\\n', 'Moreover, Locke asserts that ideas in themselves, “being only so many . . . appear-\\n', 'ances there [in the mind],” cannot be false.41 So, there is a mental proposition that\\n', 'expresses the reason why ideas deserve to be affirmed as true—the reason why they\\n', 'cannot be misidentified. This reason is the agreement constitutive of the truth of an\\n', 'idea. This truth, expressed by the proposition “the idea is as it exists in my mind” or\\n', 'by the proposition “the idea is as I perceive it to be,” is known as the result of\\n', 'perceiving an idea.\\n', '\\n', 'What, though, should we make of Locke’s claim that “perhaps there is a secret\\n', 'reference . . . to our Ideas . . . as the Standards of that Truth” and that the mental\\n', 'proposition is “usually not taken notice of ”? I suggest that because the perception\\n', 'of an idea is a complex propositional state, we can know that proposition insofar as\\n', 'we perceive the idea. The agreeing elements as found together in the complex\\n', 'propositional state constitute the “secret reference” of the idea to itself: Insofar as\\n', 'the elements internal to the propositional state stand to each other, the idea can be\\n', '40 Although insofar as it is a mental state, consciousness is a real thing in the mind, I will argue in chapter four that Locke sees consciousness not only as a mental state in which I am aware of an I perceiving, but also the ongoing self that I am aware of in that mental state.\\n', '\\n', '41 “And so I say, that the Ideas in our Minds being only so many Perceptions, or Appearances there, none of them are false. The Idea of a Centaur, having no more Falsehood in it, when it appears in our Minds; than the Name Centaur has Falsehood in it, when it is pronounced by our Mouths, or written on Paper” (II.xxxii.3).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'seen to stand to itself. When Locke says that the proposition “is not usually tak[en]\\n', 'notice of ” we can see him as distinguishing what constitutes the truth of the idea\\n', 'from what constitutes our knowledge of that truth. I suggest that insofar as we “take\\n', 'notice” of the ideas we are perceiving, we know the agreement expressed in the true\\n', 'proposition.\\n', '\\n', 'Locke does not say specifically that having knowledge requires that we attend to\\n', 'our mental states, but he does say that “taking notice” of our mental states is\\n', 'required for the production of ideas of sensation (II.ix.4) and of ideas of reflection\\n', '(II.i.4, II.i.7). If some degree of attention is required for passively receiving ideas of\\n', 'sensation, then it is reasonable to think that having knowledge of our own ideas\\n', '(or having knowledge of any other agreement) requires it too. In all three cases,\\n', 'though, Locke seems to see attention as a way of engaging in an act of perception\\n', 'rather than constituting an additional perception. This seems to be confirmed in\\n', 'II.xix.3 when Locke “digresses” from his explication of the modes of thinking to\\n', 'mention “Attention, Revery, and Dreaming,” which are described as “different\\n', 'state[s] of the Mind in thinking.” For example, “the mind employs it self about\\n', 'them [its perceptions of ideas] with several different degrees of Attention. Some-\\n', 'times the mind fixes it self with so much earnestness on the Contemplation of\\n', 'some Objects. . . . At other times, it barely observes the train of Ideas.” Presumably,\\n', 'perceiving an agreement can fall anywhere on this scale. Insofar as I take notice of\\n', 'the idea of the black of the typed words and the idea of the white of the paper in\\n', 'front of me, I know that “the black of the type is not the white of the paper.” Such is\\n', 'the nature of intuitive knowledge; I just have it “as soon as ever the Mind turns its\\n', 'view” (IV.ii.1) to those ideas. Similarly, because perceptions of ideas are propos-\\n', 'itional states, insofar as I take notice of the idea I am perceiving, I will know that\\n', 'proposition. It is time now to turn to the agreeing elements constituting the truth\\n', 'of the proposition known.\\n', '\\n', '3.I.4 The Agreement in Knowing an Idea\\n', 'Knowledge is the perception of an agreement or disagreement of ideas expressed in\\n', 'a true proposition. I have argued that perceptions of ideas are complex propos-\\n', 'itional states; I have argued that Locke thinks ideas are true in what he calls a\\n', '“metaphysical sense of the word truth,” and I have argued that there is a family of\\n', 'propositions that express that truth, the best articulation of which is “the idea is as\\n', 'I am perceiving it to be.” It is time now to see what the truth of an idea consists in\\n', 'such that the foregoing proposition adequately expresses it. That is, what is the\\n', 'nature of the agreement the perception of which constitutes our knowledge of an\\n', 'idea? Important to keep in mind, as we move through these arguments, is that\\n', 'perceptions of ideas are complex mental states with distinct constituent elements.\\n', '\\n', 'And any agreeing elements therein can be known intuitively to agree as a part of the\\n', 'complex mental state. As I argued in chapter two, consciousness is a constituent of\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'every perception of an idea.42 But Locke also states clearly that every idea is\\n', 'accompanied by an idea of existence:\\n', 'Existence and Unity, are two other Ideas, that are suggested to the Understanding, by every\\n', 'Object without, and every Idea within. When Ideas are in our Minds, we consider them as\\n', 'being actually there, as well as we consider things to be actually without us; which is, that they\\n', 'exist, or have Existence.\\n', '\\n', '(II.vii.7)\\n', 'Here and elsewhere in II.vii, Locke tells us that simple ideas of existence (along with\\n', 'ideas of pleasure, pain, power, and unity) “are suggested” (II.vii.7), “join themselves”\\n', '(II.vii.2), or are “annexed” (II.vii.6) to all of our other ideas. I take this to mean that\\n', 'when we perceive any idea, simultaneously we also perceive an idea of existence.\\n', '\\n', 'Therefore, also constituent in the complex mental state that is the perception of an\\n', 'idea is an idea of existence. We now have three different constituents of the perception\\n', 'of any idea: the idea perceived, an idea of existence, and the consciousness that I am\\n', 'perceiving them.\\n', '\\n', 'What is more, in II.vii.7 above, Locke tells us that because the idea of existence is\\n', '“annexed” to any idea, whenever we perceive an idea we have the experience of that\\n', 'idea as existing in the mind.43 He says, I “consider them [the idea] as actually being\\n', 'there.” So, the simultaneity of the idea perceived and the idea of existence grounds\\n', 'the knowledge that the idea is there. But also constituent in the complex mental state,\\n', 'and so simultaneous with the idea perceived and the idea of existence, is conscious-\\n', 'ness, which is an awareness of an I perceiving. The simultaneity of the idea perceived\\n', 'and consciousness grounds the knowledge of what the idea is.

Ruth Mattern (1978: 682) cites\\n', 'passages from the Essay (those we have already seen) to show that, for Locke, all\\n', 'knowledge is propositional.

Mattern applies this conclusion to resolve the apparent conflict between\\n', 'the general definition of knowledge and Locke’s description of sensitive knowledge as\\n', '“an actual real Existence agreeing to an Idea” (IV.i.7).

In the latter case,\\n', 'as we have, she argues, in sensitive knowledge, what grounds the knowledge is not the\\n', 'relation between the ideas themselves as found in the proposition.

As Mattern explains,\\n', 'these are cases in which there are “states of affairs that render propositions true and\\n', 'false. . . . It is . . . what Locke . . . terms the ‘grounds of Affirmation and Negation’”\\n', '(E IV.i.7: 527). But in the former case, which Mattern (1978: 693) calls “idea-theoretic”\\n', 'truths, “the two sorts of agreement coincide; the relation between ideas is both the state\\n', 'rendering the proposition true and the state of the proposition expressing this truth.”\\n', 'Applying this argument to a case of knowing an idea, namely an “idea-theoretic truth,”\\n', 'we can see our knowledge of an idea as grounded in the state of affairs that renders the\\n', 'idea (“metaphysically”) true, but at the same time it is also the agreement expressed in\\n', 'the structure or composition of the proposition itself.48\\n', 'Perhaps now is the time to consider a few possible objections. First, one might\\n', 'wonder whether I have actually succeeded in showing that intuitive knowledge of our\\n', 'own ideas is consistent with Locke’s definition of knowledge. For example, Newman\\n', '(2004, 2007) argues that knowledge, for Locke, consists only in a perception of an\\n', 'agreement between two ideas. Rickless (2008: 86) cites the following passage from\\n', 'IV.i.5 as the most persuasive of the same claim, since it seems to say that there is “no\\n', 'room” for any kind of agreement that is not between two ideas: “There could be no\\n', 'room for any positive Knowledge at all, if we could not perceive any Relation between\\n', 'our Ideas, and find out the Agreement or Disagreement, they have one with another,\\n', 'in several ways the Mind takes of comparing them.” I do not think we have to see the\\n', 'interpretation I have offered as conflicting with these passages. One reason is that the\\n', 'latter is found in the section in which Locke is describing only our knowledge of\\n', 'general truths as covered in the specific category of “Relation in general.” When\\n', 'describing these relations Locke usually refers to mathematical or moral relations,\\n', 'which are primarily known through demonstrations. But as already noted, knowing\\n', 'the identity of an idea (and of our own existence and even of the existence of an\\n', 'external object) is an instance of having knowledge of a particular thing, which\\n', 'perhaps calls for a different, yet by and large consistent, explanation. And as Locke\\n', 'has warned us in IV.i.7, these are “peculiar ways of agreements.” But more to the\\n', 'point, I do not think my interpretation disagrees with Locke’s definition of know-\\n', 'ledge, since there is the perception of an agreement of ideas, even if there is more to\\n', 'the agreement that just what we get from those two ideas.49\\n', '48 Rickless (2008: 90) argues against taking Mattern’s account to solve the problem of sensitive knowledge, because what is taken to agree is not the ideas in the proposition, but the underlying extra-mental entities signified by the ideas. This is no problem for my interpretation, since his argument does not apply equally to “idea-theoretic truths.”\\n', '49 The structure of the agreement in knowing the existence of an external object will be shown (in\\n', 'part II) to be structurally similar in that there is more to the agreement than just what we get from the agreeing ideas.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'Second, there might be a different, yet related objection: my account of the\\n', 'proposition in knowing an idea conflicts with Locke’s IV.5 account of truth. Locke\\n', 'says that truth is “the joining or separating of Signs, as the Things signified by them,\\n', 'do agree or disagree one with another” (IV.5.2) and that “Truth properly belongs\\n', 'only to Propositions” (IV.5.2). Thus, the objection would be that a true proposition\\n', 'must be the joining of signs, either ideas or words. It cannot be, as I have argued, the\\n', 'joining of constituents of the complex mental state of perceiving an idea, since one of\\n', 'those three constituents is consciousness. I suggest, however, that Locke leaves room\\n', 'for just such an interpretation. At the end of his discussion of true and false ideas in\\n', 'II.xxxii.19, Locke has this to say:\\n', 'Though in compliance with the ordinary way of Speaking, I have shewed in what sense, and\\n', 'upon what ground our Ideas may be sometimes called true, or false; yet if we look a little nearer\\n', 'into the matter in all cases, where any Idea is call’d true, or false, it is from some Judgment that the Mind makes, or is supposed to make, that is true, or false. For Truth, or Falshood, being\\n', 'never without some Affirmation, or Negation, Express, or Tacit, it is not to be found, but where\\n', 'signs are joined or separated, according to the agreement, or disagreement, of the Things they\\n', 'stand for. The signs we chiefly use, are either Ideas, or Words, wherewith we make either\\n', 'mental, or verbal Propositions.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxxii.19)\\n', 'Notice that when we look very closely into the grounds of truth or falsity (whether it is\\n', 'the “ordinary way of Speaking” or the metaphysical sense) what constitutes the truth\\n', 'of an idea is due to “some [true] judgment the mind makes.” Moreover, the signs we\\n', 'use to compose those propositions, Locke says, are “chiefly” ideas and words. There-\\n', 'fore, there can be cases in which a sign used to form the proposition is not an idea or a\\n', 'word. Therefore, it can be consciousness, an awareness of an I perceiving.\\n', '\\n', 'Third, one might want to accept the spirit of my interpretation but at the same\\n', 'time press the foregoing objection by arguing that there are other ways to interpret\\n', 'knowing an idea, ways perhaps that are more in keeping with the assumption that the\\n', 'proposition known is a common identity statement.50 For example, we might see\\n', 'Locke as saying that when there is an idea in the mind I know its truth by comparing\\n', 'that idea with another idea. For example, the comparison would be of the original\\n', 'idea white with another idea white, say from memory. But if this is Locke’s view, then\\n', 'his account of the intuitive knowledge of our own ideas as “foundational” cannot get\\n', 'off the ground, for we would need already a standard in the mind by which to make\\n', 'the comparison and perceive the identity (agreement). This would also threaten\\n', 'Locke’s empiricism.\\n', '\\n', 'Another possible explanation (in the form of an objection) is that when we perceive\\n', 'and distinguish an idea, the mind duplicates or re-presents the idea so that there can\\n', '50 As mentioned earlier, virtually no one has provided an account of the proposition known (and the agreement perceived) when we have intuitive knowledge of our own ideas. Most, I suspect have not\\n', 'thought much about it or have merely assumed that the agreement perceived is between two tokens of an idea type. The following objections are some I see possible.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'be a comparison between them. But this seems an unlikely scenario considering\\n', 'Locke’s derogatory view of “identity propositions” (IV.viii.2). Thus, we can see this\\n', 'disparaging attitude extending to mental propositions formed and agreements per-\\n', 'ceived as the result of a re-presentation of an idea. In addition, in the IV.i.4 explan-\\n', 'ation of our knowledge of the agreement of identity, just after he says that we know\\n', 'ideas individually, Locke denies that “any maxim or Proposition in the World [would]\\n', 'make him know it clearer or surer than he did before.” If it is Locke’s view that\\n', 'knowing the identity of an idea consists in re-presenting the idea and then perceiving\\n', 'an agreement between the original and the re-presentation, then surely this would be a\\n', 'case in which a proposition is generated to affirm what we already seem to know about\\n', 'the original idea. Furthermore, to assign to Locke a re-presentation interpretation\\n', 'would saddle him with the psychologically implausible view that the mind engages in\\n', 'the task of double-checking its ideas in order to know that they really are as we\\n', 'perceive them. Charity would frown on such a move.\\n', '\\n', 'Finally, if the identity perceived in the re-presentation view is interpreted as the\\n', 'perception of resemblance between a particular idea and a re-presentation of itself,\\n', 'then knowing the identity of an idea is no different from knowing any other relation.\\n', '\\n', 'But Locke himself, already cited from IV.i.7 in the introduction to this chapter,\\n', 'makes a point of distinguishing the agreement of identity from agreements, like\\n', 'resemblance, that fall into the category of relation in general. Owen (1999: 41)\\n', 'analyzes the peculiarity this way: “Identity is distinct because it is primordial and\\n', 'fundamental to our awareness of ideas.”\\n', 'Given everything said, I suggest that there are sufficient reasons to accept the\\n', 'interpretation I have put forward.\\n', '\\n', '3.I.5. An Analogous Case: Knowing I Exist\\n', 'As mentioned earlier, Locke’s version of the cogito argument includes the claim that\\n', 'we have intuitive knowledge of our own existence conveyed in the act of perceiving\\n', 'any idea:\\n', 'As for our own Existence, we perceive it so plainly, and so certainly, that it neither needs, nor is capable of any proof. For nothing can be more evident to us, than our own Existence. I think,\\n', 'I reason, I feel Pleasure and Pain; Can any of these be more evident to me, than my own\\n', 'Existence? . . . Experience then convinces us, that we have an intuitive Knowledge of our own\\n', 'Existence, and an internal infallible Perception that we are. In every Act of Sensation,\\n', 'Reasoning, or Thinking, we are conscious to our selves of our own Being; and, in this Matter,\\n', 'come not short of the highest degree of Certainty.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ix.3)\\n', 'Locke asserts first that we perceive our own existence “plainly,” “certainly,” and\\n', 'without any need of proof. He says, “I think, I reason, I feel Pleasure and Pain; Can\\n', 'any of these be more evident to me, than my own Existence?” Knowing that we exist\\n', 'is just as certain and evident to us as knowing the ideas in our own minds: the\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'analogy is to the intuitive knowledge of our own ideas. Second, we know that we exist\\n', 'in virtue of any act of thinking, for Locke, “having ideas” (II.i.9). Third, it is important\\n', 'that he does not say that knowing my own existence requires anything in addition to\\n', 'what is presently in my mind. Neither does he say that the knowledge is inferred in a\\n', 'separate act of the mind. Thus, there are very good reasons to conclude that we have\\n', 'certain non-inferential knowledge of our own existence as a part of perceiving an idea.\\n', '\\n', 'In the perception of an idea I know intuitively that I exist.51\\n', 'If we try to provide the same sort of analysis here as we did in knowing our own\\n', 'ideas, then there must be a proposition whose stated agreement expresses what makes\\n', 'the proposition true. And in perceiving any idea we know that truth. In a way that is a\\n', 'analogous, then, to how in perceiving an idea, I know the truth of the idea—that “it is\\n', 'as I am perceiving it to be,” in perceiving an idea I know the truth of my existence—\\n', 'that the “I perceiving exists.” To see this, consider again Locke’s analysis of knowing an\\n', 'idea: we know that an idea exists in the mind and we know that what is presented in\\n', 'the mind is as we perceive it. Explaining these aspects of knowing an idea required that\\n', 'we isolate the three (simultaneous) constituents of any perception of an idea: an idea\\n', 'perceived, an idea of existence, and consciousness (an I perceiving). As the result of all\\n', 'three constituents in the mind simultaneously, there is an agreement of mental\\n', 'content—a state of affairs—expressed in any of a family of propositions Locke uses\\n', 'when he speaks of knowing an idea. Similarly, knowing that “I exist” is the result of\\n', 'perceiving any idea, because of the simultaneity of the same trio of constituents—the\\n', 'same mental content, most specifically the idea of existence and consciousness. So,\\n', 'when I perceive an idea, just as I have the intuitive knowledge that “the idea is as I am\\n', 'perceiving it to be,” I also have the intuitive knowledge that “I exist as perceiving an\\n', 'idea”—or more simply, that I exist. Again, as the result of the complexity of a\\n', 'perception of an idea, there is a proposition whose stated agreement is what makes\\n', 'the proposition true. And in perceiving the idea, I know that proposition. The\\n', 'compresence of all three constituents of any perception of an idea is the state rendering\\n', 'true and at the same time the state of those true propositions expressing what we know\\n', 'when we know our ideas and our own existence.\\n', '\\n', 'Locke (1976: letters 1869, 1884) can be seen to confirm such an interpretation of\\n', 'the knowledge of our own existence in the 1695 (second) letter from Wynne and\\n', 'explicitly in his own journal note from 1696 when he says “our own existence is\\n', 'known to us by a certainty yet higher than our senses can give us of the existence of\\n', 'other things, and that is internal perception, a self-consciousness or intuition.”52 The\\n', 'intuitive perception that I am perceiving is due to self-consciousness, which is\\n', 'internal to any act of perception.

Why should we think it is?\\n', '\\n', 'Let us focus for a minute on sensory ideas. Locke is committed to the view that\\n', 'simple ideas are “real” ideas, which means that they are in a representational relation\\n', 'of regular correspondence with their causes or “archetypes.”53 As Bolton (2004a: 316)\\n', 'explains,\\n', '53 “By real Ideas, I mean such as have a Foundation in Nature; such as have a Conformity with the real Being, and Existence of Things, or with their Archetypes” (II.xxx.1). I will have much more to say about the\\n', '“reality” and “adequacy” of ideas in part II of this chapter.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'simple ideas have representative content in virtue of two conditions: (i) a steady causal link\\n', 'between ideas and their objects; (ii) an essential marking function in execution of which simple\\n', 'ideas are taken to convey something (rightly or wrongly) about the objects to which they direct\\n', 'notice, namely their individual and qualitative features and similarities.\\n', '\\n', 'So simple ideas are supposed to be giving us the kind of information about their\\n', 'causes that enables us to distinguish one cause from another. But as Bolton and\\n', 'LoLordo have argued, both simple sensory ideas (Bolton 2004a, LoLordo 2008) and\\n', 'general sensory ideas (Bolton 2004b) can fail to distinguish the correct causes. For\\n', 'example, I can misidentify the round tower I now see as square, and I can in general\\n', 'identify honey as always bitter instead of sweet. Problematically, our sensory ideas\\n', 'are not immune to error.\\n', '\\n', 'In addition, it seems that we have everyday experience of being mistaken about our\\n', 'own ideas. For example, for the longest time, periodically, I would get a toothache.\\n', '\\n', 'The pain I experienced was a pain in my left incisor. Several trips to the dentist\\n', 'resulting in minor procedures failed to alleviate the pain. Still I experienced the idea\\n', 'pain in my incisor. Then in the course of a regular check-up, the dentist discovered a\\n', 'crack in my left front molar, just two teeth down from the painful incisor. After this\\n', 'tooth was crowned, I no longer experienced pain in my incisor. So all along I had\\n', 'been misidentifying the idea pain in my incisor. That is, the representational content\\n', 'of the idea was actually pain in my molar, since the idea was in a relation of regular\\n', 'correspondence with my molar and “marking” or distinguishing the impinging of the\\n', 'nerve in my molar.54 So Locke’s commitments with respect to the representational\\n', 'role of sensory ideas—that they correctly identify their causes—cannot accommodate\\n', 'what I take to be a somewhat common experience of misidentifying our own ideas.55\\n', 'Misidentification of this kind, however, need not be seen as a counterexample to\\n', 'Locke’s account of the intuitive knowledge of our own ideas. For once we separate the\\n', 'content from the object of thinking, we see that the phenomenal experience of our\\n', 'perceptions of ideas in both their qualitative and first-personal aspects should not be\\n', 'seen as the same as the object thought about.

In a case of knowing an idea, it is the qualitative, first-\\n', 'personal, and existential aspects of the perception of an idea that agree, not the\\n', '54 One might object that the pain is in both the incisor and the molar because of the way in which the pain in our teeth is diffused. So the idea pain in my incisor would not be incorrectly identifying its cause.\\n', '\\n', 'Nevertheless, for Locke, it is still problematic, since the same idea would be identifying two different causes (and so have two different representational contents)—pain in the molar and pain in the incisor. I thank Ed McCann for helping me to think more clearly about this.\\n', '\\n', '55 My thanks to Martha Bolton for presenting me with a similar example, which led to major\\n', 'improvements in the arguments of this chapter.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'qualitative experience and the cause of the idea. So, I can be wrong about the causes of\\n', 'my ideas and still be immune to error with respect to whether the idea is as I am\\n', 'perceiving it to be.56 Another way to say this is that I can be wrong that the pain I feel\\n', 'is actually in my incisor, but I cannot be wrong about the particular pain-ish idea\\n', 'I am experiencing—or as Locke would say, that the pain-ish idea is as I am perceiving\\n', 'it to be.

For Locke seems to say\\n', 'that we cannot have knowledge as the result of perceiving an idea:\\n', 'For I place certainty where I think everybody will find it, and nowhere else, viz. in the\\n', 'perception of the agreement or disagreement of ideas; so that, in my opinion, it is impossible\\n', 'to be placed in any one single idea, simple or complex.\\n', '\\n', '(Locke 1823, iv: 57)\\n', 'Nor is it one idea by itself that in any case makes us certain; but certainty consists in the\\n', 'perceived agreement or disagreement of all the ideas that serve to show the agreement or\\n', 'disagreement of distinct ideas, as they stand in a proposition, whose truth or falsehood we\\n', 'would be certain of.\\n', '\\n', '(Locke 1823, iv: 60)\\n', 'Given my interpretation I find this objection a little far-fetched, but let me still try to\\n', 'alleviate any possible concern. It might be helpful, first, to look at the context in\\n', 'which Locke makes the above statements to Stillingfleet. These statements are in\\n', 'response to Stillingfleet’s insistence that Locke has not proved the existence of God by\\n', 'the use of ideas, but by the use of reason, namely by employing innately known\\n', '“principles of reason” (Locke 1823, iv: 56). Just following the first passage in question,\\n', 'Locke (1823, iv: 57) rephrases Stillingfleet’s objection as follows: “What! Can the\\n', 'grounds of our certainty arise from the idea of ourselves? No, certainly.” To which\\n', 'Locke “with due respect” replies, “Yes, certainly. The certainty of the being of a God\\n', 'is grounded on the idea of ourselves as we are thinking beings.” Locke (1823, iv: 58)\\n', '56 Interestingly, Gassendi tries to combat skepticism by arguing that the causes ideas identify are far enough up the causal chain to preclude error. LoLordo (2008: 718) explains, “Appearances are true, on Gassendi’s view, because they are fully accurate transcriptions of the information received at the end of the perceptual chain (e.g., the information the optic nerve carries to the brain). This information comes partly from the distal cause (the square tower), and partly from the way the information that cause provides is altered by the medium and mechanism of perception. Thus the appearances can be true, in the sense of conveying such information accurately, even when the distal object in question appears differently—square to the person close up, for example, and round to the person far away.” Although the way in which I am arguing that ideas are true for Locke is not insofar as they represent their causes, it is similar to Gassendi’s anti-skepticism in that the complexity of a perceptual act allows that there is no room for error in the agreement constituting the truth of the idea.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'continues, “My lord, I must confess I never thought, that the consideration of\\n', 'ourselves, and what we find in our own constitutions, excluded the consideration\\n', 'of the idea either of being or of thinking, two of the ideas that make a part of the\\n', 'complex idea a man has of him self.”57 Thus, the context of the passage, namely that\\n', 'the argument for the existence of God can begin with the complex idea of a human\\n', 'being as a thinking being, tells against the objection. For, first, Locke does allow that\\n', 'the perception of an idea leads to a proposition constituting knowledge: The consid-\\n', 'eration of a complex idea of ourselves can lead to a proposition containing ideas of\\n', 'thinking and being, ideas internal to the complex idea.\\n', '\\n', 'Second, when Locke says that knowledge “cannot be placed in any one single idea,”\\n', 'he means that knowledge is propositional. But that all knowledge is propositional is\\n', 'fully consistent with the interpretation I have given in which we perceive the truth of\\n', 'a proposition as the result of perceiving an idea—or, really, as the result of perceiving\\n', 'a constellation of mental content that includes two ideas. Indeed, it is somewhat\\n', 'analogous to Locke’s own example in which the truth of a proposition is perceived on\\n', 'the basis of perceiving all of the component elements contributing to the complexity\\n', 'of an idea.\\n', '\\n', 'Third, the context of the passage tells against the objection in another way. Locke’s\\n', 'statement that we cannot have knowledge with only one idea is in defense of his view\\n', 'that reason is a capacity of the mind employed about the ideas gained from sensation\\n', 'and reflection. Reason, for Locke, “perceives the necessary, and indubitable connex-\\n', 'ion of all the Ideas or Proofs one to another” (IV.xvii.2). Reason, therefore, is an\\n', 'ability of the mind to “cast about” for intermediate premises to help construct a\\n', 'demonstrative proof. It is not to be thought of as a stock of already known rational\\n', 'principles (or ideas) waiting in the mind to be discovered. This is suggested by\\n', 'Locke’s reply that he does not understand what Stillingfleet could mean when he\\n', 'puts forward the view that “from the consideration of ourselves, and what we find in\\n', 'our own constitutions, the certainty is placed in good and sound reason. . . . But not in\\n', 'the idea” (iv: 58). I suggest that Locke’s response here has to do with how we are able\\n', 'to come to knowledge of the existence of God, not just by the consideration of an\\n', 'idea, but also by the mind’s ability to use the faculty of reason to construct a\\n', 'demonstrative proof. So, Locke is not necessarily denying that we can have propos-\\n', 'itional knowledge on the basis of perceiving individual ideas. He is only denying that\\n', 'an individual idea (without either propositions or the use of reason) can result in a\\n', 'successful demonstration. Therefore, we need not read the foregoing statements to\\n', 'Stillingfleet as precluding the interpretation of the intuitive knowledge of an idea (or\\n', 'of ourselves) that I have put forward.\\n', '\\n', 'Considering what we find in the Essay, that is, owing to (1) the claim that we\\n', 'know the identity of individual ideas; (2) the claim that general identity statements\\n', '57 Note that this idea would be a full-fledged idea of the self, which results from reflecting on the pre-reflective experience of an I (or self-consciousness) in any perception of an idea.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'are trivial while knowledge of the identity of an idea is foundational; (3) the\\n', 'evidence that consciousness is self-consciousness and of the particular relation\\n', 'between consciousness and perception that allows textual and philosophical con-\\n', 'sistency to Locke’s model of the mind; (4) the claim that we have an idea of\\n', 'existence “joined” or “annexed” to every other idea; (5) the evidence that there\\n', 'need not be an additional mental act to know an agreement intuitively; and (6) the\\n', 'claim that ideas are “metaphysically true,” namely “really to be such as they exist”\\n', 'in the mind, something along the lines of what I have argued might be the best we\\n', 'can do for Locke. The sheer number of passages affirming something like the\\n', 'interpretation I have put forward should, at the very least, tip the balance in its\\n', 'favor. Therefore, we should see the intuitive knowledge of our own ideas, which\\n', 'grounds the possibility of attaining any knowledge at all, as well as the knowledge of\\n', 'our own existence, as forms of propositional knowledge conveyed in the perception\\n', 'of an individual idea. That is, perceptions of ideas are complex propositional states\\n', 'conveying knowledge.\\n', '\\n', '3.I.8 Conclusion\\n', 'So far in this chapter, I have worked to fill in Locke scholarship by providing an\\n', 'interpretation of the intuitive knowledge of an individual idea that is consistent\\n', 'with Locke’s understanding of knowledge as the perception of a true proposition\\n', '(an agreement of ideas) and that can serve as a suitable foundation for knowledge\\n', 'given what we find in the Essay and elsewhere. I argued that perceptions of ideas are\\n', 'complex propositional states that convey knowledge. In perceiving any idea, I know\\n', 'two propositions resulting from agreeing elements therein. Because in the percep-\\n', 'tion of any idea there is included an idea of existence and my consciousness of\\n', 'myself as perceiving both ideas, I know tacitly or implicitly that the idea is as I am\\n', 'perceiving it to be and that I exist. Now that I have explained the complexity of our\\n', 'mental states and how as the result of that complexity we have knowledge of our\\n', 'own ideas and our own existence, in parts II and III I will extend that analysis to an\\n', 'explanation of how (in part II), and the extent to which (in part III), for Locke, we\\n', 'can claim to have knowledge of particular things existing external to us. As will be\\n', 'shown, the same trio of elements constituent in any perception of an idea have a\\n', 'role to play in constituting the agreement perceived in what Locke calls “sensitive”\\n', 'knowledge.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'PART II\\n', 'Knowing the Existence\\n', 'of Particular External\\n', 'Objects\\n', 'In part I of this chapter, I argued that knowing the agreements in the intuitive\\n', 'knowledge of our own ideas and of our own existence is the result of the complexity\\n', 'inherent in the perception of any idea.

Here in part II, I will extend that analysis to an explanation of the\\n', 'agreement perceived in knowing the existence of particular external objects. Just as\\n', 'we saw in the previous cases, the agreement perceived in having knowledge of\\n', 'something external to me will also make sense of the proposition Locke uses to\\n', 'express it.

Rickless (forthcoming) argues that demonstrative knowledge is not less certain than intuitive knowledge, although it lacks, as Locke says, “that evident lustre” and “perfect Clearness and Distinctness” (IV.ii.6) that comes with intuitive knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'Locke, however, does seem to say fairly explicitly that demonstrative knowledge is a different degree of certainty when he “allow[s] these three degrees of Knowledge, viz. Intuitive, Demonstrative, and Sensitive: In each of which, there are different degrees and ways of Evidence and Certainty” (IV.ii.14). Also, I will address the consistency of both holding that demonstrative knowledge is less certain than intuitive knowledge and Locke’s claims about the difference between them in lustre, clearness, and distinctness in part III.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'us) is even less certain than that. Which degree of certainty is reached seems to\\n', 'depend on the way the agreement is perceived. Immediately known agreements, non-\\n', 'inferential knowledge, have the highest degree of certainty, while the need for\\n', 'intervening ideas, resulting in inferential knowledge, lessens the certainty.\\n', '\\n', 'What about sensitive knowledge? Is it inferential, or is it non-inferential? Answering\\n', 'this question merely leads to a host of others. On the one hand, if it is inferential, then\\n', 'how is it any different from demonstrative knowledge? Perhaps the reason is that it\\n', 'has to do with particular existences as opposed to general truths. Quite naturally, we\\n', 'would think there to be an inference from an idea to the existence of an external\\n', 'object. But then, also quite naturally, we might ask why it qualifies as anything more\\n', 'than probable judgment. Support for this line of reasoning, one might continue, is\\n', 'found in IV.xi.4–7, where Locke provides a series of probabilistic arguments in\\n', 'defense of sensitive knowledge. Thinking these arguments are meant as sole justifi-\\n', 'cation for sensitive knowledge, however, leaves us again wondering why Locke calls it\\n', 'knowledge. Why would he open the door to a third degree of knowledge by distin-\\n', 'guishing it from demonstrative knowledge of general truths? On the other hand, if\\n', 'sensitive knowledge is non-inferential, then how is it different from intuitive know-\\n', 'ledge, and how can it be less certain than demonstrative knowledge?\\n', '\\n', 'I suggest that these questions, roughly, boil down to the following three: First, how\\n', 'can Locke think that we have knowledge of things external to the mind when ideas\\n', 'serve as the immediate objects of perception? Second, given that Locke thinks\\n', 'sensitive knowledge counts as a (less certain) form of knowledge, why would he\\n', 'offer a series of probabilistic arguments in defense of it? Third, how should we see\\n', 'sensitive knowledge as something different from intuitive and demonstrative know-\\n', 'ledge given that we are limited to just two ways of perceiving agreements: either non-\\n', 'inferentially or inferentially? I see the first two questions, and relatedly the third, as\\n', 'motivated primarily by skeptical concerns. Given that ideas are the objects of percep-\\n', 'tion, how can Locke think we have knowledge of things external to us? Another way to\\n', 'pose this question is to ask, what does Locke think we actually know in an instance of\\n', 'sensitive knowledge, and how do we know it? Later in part III of this chapter, I will\\n', 'offer an interpretation of sensitive knowledge that answers these skeptical concerns.\\n', '\\n', 'Before we move on to Locke’s treatment of the skeptical challenge, though, it is\\n', 'important, first, to address a different puzzle. For seeing how sensitive knowledge\\n', 'can fall under the category of knowledge at all requires an understanding of how it\\n', 'satisfies the general definition of knowledge. What is the agreement perceived in an\\n', 'instance of sensitive knowledge such that, given Locke’s representationalism, it makes\\n', 'sense to say we have sufficient contact with things outside us to make any claims about\\n', 'their actual existence? Here in part II, I provide an answer to this question.\\n', '\\n', 'Locke understands knowledge as consisting in the perception of an agreement or\\n', 'disagreement of ideas (IV.i.2). From this, he says, “it follows . . . That [w]e can have\\n', 'Knowledge no farther than we have Ideas” (IV.iii.1). But then he describes the\\n', 'agreement in sensitive knowledge, a species of the knowledge of real existence, as\\n', '\\n', 'KNOWING THE EXISTENCE OF PARTICULAR EXTERNAL OBJECTS\\n', '\\n', '“that of actual real Existence agreeing to any Idea” (IV.i.7).59 These two descriptions\\n', 'seem to conflict, and no interpretive suggestion for how to resolve the tension has\\n', 'carried the day. How can knowledge extend no farther than our ideas (be the\\n', 'perception of an agreement of ideas) and yet what we know is expressed by the\\n', 'proposition: “actual real Existence agreeing to any Idea”?\\n', '\\n', 'A spate of interpretations has come forward in recent years, each emphasizing\\n', 'various aspects of Locke’s account. My interpretation is in agreement with many of\\n', 'these aspects. For example, like Mattern (1978) and Soles (1985), I emphasize the\\n', 'propositional nature of knowledge. But unlike them, I do not argue that the true\\n', 'proposition known corresponds to an external existent. Rather my interpretation is\\n', 'fully consistent with Locke’s general (fully ideational) definition of knowledge.60 Like\\n', 'Ayers (1991) and Bolton (2004a), I give due weight to the contribution of Locke’s\\n', 'semantic externalism. Unlike them, I argue that the proposition known in an instance\\n', 'of sensitive knowledge includes also internalist epistemic justification. Like Allen\\n', '(2013) and Nagel (forthcoming), I argue for the importance of the subjective experi-\\n', 'ence of sensing in an instance of sensitive knowledge. Unlike both, I argue that the\\n', 'proposition known does not include a reflective idea of sensation. And like Owen\\n', '(2008), Allen (2013), and Weinberg (2013), I argue that sensitive knowledge is non-\\n', 'inferential.61 But my account, unlike all these others (and some I have not men-\\n', 'tioned),62 fully explains the contribution of both the internalist and externalist aspects,\\n', 'and it does so without textual conflict and without tempting incoherence with other of\\n', 'Locke’s views. Because these other interpretations and objections to them are readily\\n', 'available and it would take up far too much space to rehearse them all, I will not\\n', 'reiterate them here.63 Rather, when appropriate, I will simply note reasons for\\n', '59 Locke provides this definition as a general one to cover all three cases of the knowledge of real existence: knowledge of my own existence, knowledge of the existence of God, and knowledge of the existence of particular finite beings (IV.i.7, IV.iii.21). In part I, I argued that the complexity of the perception of an idea provides us with the agreement in knowing that I exist. Consistent with the analysis in part I, the complexity of the appropriate mental state will also provide the elements constitutive of the agreement in the case of sensitive knowledge. Knowing that God exists is different and I will not go into it, nor need I, since it is a derivative case of demonstrative knowledge that begins with the knowledge of my own existence as a thinking being.\\n', '\\n', '60 Hill (2006), also emphasizing the propositional nature of knowledge, includes a good summary and criticism of both Mattern and Soles.\\n', '\\n', '61 Only Weinberg (2013) provides a comprehensive argument that sensitive knowledge is non-\\n', 'inferential.\\n', '\\n', '62 These would include Newman (2004, 2007) and Rickless (2008).

But there is significant textual evidence against such an interpretation. See, for example, IV.xxi.4 and IV.iii.1.

Consistent with the previous analysis in part I of how\\n', 'we know other particular things (individual ideas and our own existence), the same\\n', 'trio of constituents comprising the complexity of the perception of an idea forms the\\n', 'agreement perceived in an instance of sensitive knowledge. Therefore, as in those\\n', 'other two cases, there is no conflict with Locke’s general definition of knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'I will then, in section 3.II.5, explain why my account is consistent with Locke’s\\n', 'statements to Stillingfleet about the nature of the agreement perceived in having\\n', 'sensitive knowledge.\\n', '\\n', '3.II.1 Locke’s Commitments—The Elements\\n', 'of Sensitive Knowledge\\n', 'A survey of the Essay reveals that Locke’s account of perceiving the agreement in\\n', 'sensitive knowledge includes five fundamental elements:\\n', '1. Knowledge in general is defined as “the perception of the connexion and\\n', 'agreement, or disagreement and repugnancy of any of our Ideas” (IV.i.2).\\n', '\\n', '2. Sensitive knowledge, a species of the knowledge of real existence, is defined as\\n', '“that of actual real Existence agreeing to an Idea” (IV.i.7).\\n', '\\n', 'strictly speaking, there is no perception of an agreement of ideas. Soles (1985) also finds a solution in Locke’s propositional account of knowledge by arguing that inferences to unobservable entities are not precluded by Locke’s empiricist principle that all knowledge originates in ideas of sensation and reflection.\\n', '\\n', 'But, arguably, both of these views stray from Locke’s definition of knowledge as the perception of an agreement or disagreement of ideas. Newman (2004, 2007) tries to reconcile the tension by having sensitive knowledge include both the perception of an agreement of ideas and a probable judgment between an idea and something external to us. Rickless (2008) and Allen (2013) lodge well-reasoned objections to Newman’s view. Rickless (2008) attempts reconciliation by arguing that the perception of some true propositions really only achieves the highest degree of probability, or what he calls “assurance.” Owen (1999), Allen (2013), Weinberg (2013), and Nagel (forthcoming) offer objections to Rickless (2008), and all but Weinberg offer their own interpretations of the agreement perceived constituting knowledge consistent with the definition of knowledge. (I am providing my interpretation in this part of chapter three.) Rickless (forthcoming) tries to defend his view against objections by Allen, Nagel, and Owen, (and Weinberg\\n', 'indirectly). Reiterating arguments by Owen, Allen, Weinberg, and Nagel, most recently Wilson (2014: 10) sums it up by saying “there are simply too many passages in which Locke refers to sensitive knowledge as knowledge while not giving any indication that he is only honorifically referring to it as such.”\\n', '\\n', 'KNOWING THE EXISTENCE OF PARTICULAR EXTERNAL OBJECTS\\n', '\\n', '3.

An internalist justificatory element whereby we are aware of sensory ideas as\\n', 'originating in sensation (IV.ii.14), rather than, say, in memory.\\n', '\\n', 'Although one might disagree that a coherent account of an instance of sensitive\\n', 'knowledge need include all five elements, in order to leave any of them out, one\\n', 'must somehow explain away what we find in the text.

And even if some interpretations admit all\\n', 'five elements, significant disagreement exists over what role each part actually plays.\\n', '\\n', 'I start with the assumption that Locke means what he says and then see how we can\\n', 'come up with an interpretation that avoids any apparent tensions or inconsistencies.\\n', '\\n', 'Because I think Locke means all five elements to play a role in an instance of\\n', 'sensitive knowledge and because I think other interpretations are flawed in one way or\\n', 'another, I am suggesting we take a new look. I argue that all five elements can be\\n', 'brought together into a reasonable and coherent picture of the agreement perceived in\\n', 'an instance of sensitive knowledge as Locke sees it—not probable judgment. One\\n', 'reason is that Locke, not unsurprisingly, focuses on the relation sensory ideas in fact\\n', 'have not only to external causes, but also, and perhaps equally importantly, to our\\n', 'subjective internal experience in having ideas of external objects. I will argue that\\n', 'elements (1)–(5) above can be accounted for by looking to what is presented to us in\\n', 'consciousness and what is implied by what is presented to us as the result of perceiving\\n', 'an occurrent idea of an external object. Consistent with how we know our own ideas\\n', 'and our own existence, I argue that this other form of knowledge—what Locke calls\\n', 'our knowledge of the existence of “particular finite beings”—is due to the complex\\n', 'nature of our perceptual states. Because of the complexity of perceptions of ideas and\\n', 'because of Locke’s one-act view of knowledge, we can know an agreement expressed\\n', 'by the proposition “actual real Existence agreeing to an Idea” just in virtue of\\n', 'having that complex mental state. Furthermore, my interpretation is consistent with\\n', 'Locke’s famous statement of the agreement when pressed by Stillingfleet in their\\n', '64 Ayers (1991, I: 159) and Bolton (2004a: 316–19) focus on the externalist justificatory condition by maintaining somewhat similarly, although by different argumentation, that any knowledge we have of the real existence of external objects is better achieved by Locke’s account of how ideas successfully represent their causes. Thus, I think they see the internalist justificatory element as having no real role to play. Allen’s (2013: 253–4) remarks sharply distinguishing “real knowledge” from “sensitive knowledge” lead me to think he may deny any role to the externalist justificatory element.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'correspondence.65 My strategy is to lay out the account we find in the Essay before\\n', 'showing its consistency with his reply to Stillingfleet.

By the end of section II.4, all of\\n', 'Locke’s commitments will be accounted for, the proposition known in an instance of\\n', 'sensitive knowledge will be fully constructed, and the tension between sensitive\\n', 'knowledge and the general definition of knowledge will be resolved.\\n', '\\n', 'Let us begin with the definition of knowledge as the perception of an agreement of\\n', 'ideas. What we are looking for is the ideas that form the basis of the agreement in an\\n', 'instance of sensitive knowledge. Locke’s IV.ii.14 account of what happens in an instance\\n', 'of sensitive knowledge is a natural place to start. He begins with the statement that along\\n', 'with intuitive and demonstrative knowledge “There is, indeed, another Perception of the\\n', 'Mind, employ’d about the particular existence of finite beings without us.” Immediately\\n', 'thereafter, he says, “There can be nothing more certain than, that the Idea we receive\\n', 'from an external Object is in our Minds.” I take this to be a clear statement when we\\n', 'have an idea of an object we know that we do: We have intuitive knowledge of the idea.\\n', '\\n', 'So having sensitive knowledge begins with the intuitive knowledge that there is in my\\n', 'mind an idea of an object: I have an immediate intuitive certainty that the intrinsic\\n', 'apparent features of the idea are in my mind.\\n', '\\n', 'But remember that Locke also thinks that all ideas are accompanied by a simple\\n', 'idea of existence (II.vii.7). Every perception of an idea is a complex mental state that\\n', 'includes, at the very least, the idea perceived, an idea of existence, and consciousness.\\n', '\\n', 'So, just as knowing an idea and knowing my own existence is grounded in this trio of\\n', 'constituents, knowing the existence of an object is also grounded in this trio of\\n', '65 Locke 1823, IV: 360. (All subsequent references to this work will be cited in the text by the\\n', 'abbreviated title Works, volume number: page number.) But I do not agree with the interpretations of the agreement as extracted from that passage offered by Newman (2004, 2007), Rickless (2008), Allen (2013), and Nagel (forthcoming).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'KNOWING THE EXISTENCE OF PARTICULAR EXTERNAL OBJECTS\\n', '\\n', 'constituents. As Locke says about the accompanying simple idea of existence,\\n', '“Existence and Unity, are two other Ideas, that are suggested to the Understanding,\\n', 'by every Object without and every Idea within. When Ideas are in our Minds, we\\n', 'consider them as being actually there, as well as we consider things to be actually\\n', 'without us; which is that they exist, or have Existence” (II.vii.7). As I have already\\n', 'argued, having any idea together with an idea of existence is the state of affairs\\n', 'expressed in the proposition that the idea is there—that it exists in my mind.\\n', '\\n', 'Whenever I have an idea in my mind, the accompanying idea of existence contributes\\n', 'to my knowing that there exists something in my mind. But, as is clear from the\\n', 'preceding passage, Locke seems to think that, at least in some cases, I also take my\\n', 'idea to be as of something existing outside my mind. We see Locke say the same sort\\n', 'of thing when talking about the signification of names in III.iv.2: “The Names of\\n', 'simple Ideas and Substances, with the abstract Ideas in the Mind, which they\\n', 'immediately signify, intimate also some real Existence, from which was derived\\n', 'their original pattern.” For example, when I am thinking about a cat, I consider\\n', 'myself as having an idea of cat. Locke, though, seems to think that at the same time\\n', 'I take my idea to be as of a cat existing outside or independently of my mind. Donald\\n', 'Ainslie (2013: 99) puts it nicely here: “We are aware of objects by means of ideas that\\n', 'present them to us from our particular perspective, in the same way we are aware of\\n', 'things outside our visual field when we look at images of them in a mirror.” I take the\\n', 'idea of the cat in my mind to be an idea as of a cat existing outside my mind. Indeed,\\n', 'I suggest we do the same thing when we have an idea of a particular piece of gold.\\n', '\\n', 'That is, when I have an idea of a piece of gold, I experience myself as having an idea\\n', 'of gold in my mind, but at the same time I also experience myself as having an idea as\\n', 'of an independently existing piece of gold.\\n', '\\n', 'We see the same sort of language describing how we experience our ideas in other\\n', 'places in the Essay. In talking about ideas of substances in III.v.3, Locke says those\\n', 'ideas “carry with them the Supposition of some real Being, from which they are\\n', 'taken, and to which they are conformable” (my emphasis in bold). Locke’s chapters\\n', 'on “real” and “adequate” ideas (II.xxx–xxxii), which are an account of how ideas\\n', 'succeed in representing things to us, have similar language. In II.xxxi.1, Locke states\\n', 'that whenever we have ideas, we also suppose those ideas to be “taken from” their\\n', '“archetypes” or causes: “Of our real Ideas some are Adequate, and some are Inad-\\n', 'equate. Those I call Adequate, which perfectly represent those Archetypes, which the\\n', 'Mind supposes them taken from; which it intends them to stand for, and to which it\\n', 'refers them” (II.xxxi.1, my emphasis in bold). Perceiving an idea as of something\\n', 'external to me includes supposing the existence of whatever the idea “stands for” or is\\n', '“referred to”—its archetype or cause.66 And it is not only “real” ideas that come with\\n', 'this suggestion that they are ideas of external things. In distinguishing “real” from\\n', '66 See also Ayers (1991, I: 62–3) and Bolton (2004a: 312).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', '“fantastical” ideas, Locke says of the latter that they “have no Foundation in Nature,\\n', 'nor have any Conformity with that reality of Being, to which they are tacitly referr’d,\\n', 'as to their Archetypes” (II.xxx.1, my emphasis in bold). So, also, we “tacitly refer” or\\n', '“suppose” our fictional ideas to represent real things in Nature, even though we may\\n', 'come to find out that they really do not. It seems to be the case, for Locke, that\\n', 'whenever I have an idea, say of a particular object, I consider, or suppose, it to be of\\n', 'something external to me. I experience it as of something external to me, as of\\n', 'something outside my mind. Consistent with how Locke describes it in II.vii.7,\\n', 'I suggest that having an idea of existence “suggested to the Understanding” with\\n', 'an idea of an object is what this “taking,” “considering,” “supposing,” or as I have\\n', 'called it, “experiencing,” consists in. Thus, ideas of objects (say, of particular finite\\n', 'beings) just are experienced as ideas of real things—as of things having a real\\n', 'existence outside of me.\\n', '\\n', 'Having these two ideas together in my mind (an idea of an object and an idea of\\n', 'existence) as a part of a more complex mental state gives me the experience or, as\\n', 'Locke says in II.vii.7, the suggestion, that what I am perceiving exists; I experience the\\n', 'idea as of an external object—as of something existing outside of my mind. That these\\n', 'two ideas and the experience of them together in the mind form the foundation of the\\n', 'agreement perceived in an instance of sensitive knowledge is confirmed by Locke in\\n', 'his defense of it to Stillingfleet: “[E]xistence is affirmed of something, some being:\\n', 'and I have as clear an idea of existence and something, the two things joined in that\\n', 'proposition, as I have of them in this proposition, ‘something exists in the world,\\n', 'whereof I have an idea’” (Works IV: 357–8). As we will see, more needs to be added\\n', 'to the explanation before we can claim to have sensitive knowledge as a part of this\\n', 'complex mental state. But we do have the basis—the two ideas—for the agreement\\n', 'expressed by the proposition Locke uses in IV.i.7: We have an idea of existence\\n', 'agreeing to an idea of an object.67\\n', 'At this point, two crucial distinctions must be made and kept in mind. First,\\n', 'although whenever we perceive an idea of an object, we experience that idea as of\\n', 'something existing outside the mind, that supposition holds up only with respect to\\n', 'real and adequate ideas of sensation. “Real” and “adequate” ideas, for Locke, are\\n', 'technical terms describing both a causal and a representational relation between some\\n', 'real existence and my idea. In Locke’s theory of representation, real and adequate\\n', 'ideas actually do correspond to the real existence of their causes.68 The supposition,\\n', 'however, does not hold up with respect to “fantastical or Chimerical” ideas. We will\\n', 'see why in just a moment. Second, perceiving an idea that in fact does correspond to\\n', '67 Here I agree with Allen (2013: 256) that the idea of existence is “itself insufficient” (my emphasis) to account for the reality and the actuality of the existence of the object. But I disagree that it does not play any role at all.\\n', '\\n', '68 Bolton (2004a: 311ff) argues that simple ideas perform their “representational function” by meeting two semantic conditions working in tandem: a causal correspondence condition and a marking condition, which involves a supposition of a really existing external thing.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'KNOWING THE EXISTENCE OF PARTICULAR EXTERNAL OBJECTS\\n', '\\n', 'something existing external to me does not also mean that the external thing has either\\n', 'present, or actual, outer existence. Present, or actual, existence would imply something\\n', 'more: that there is something outside or external to me at this moment causing my\\n', 'idea. Consider these two distinctions in this example: If I close my eyes and think\\n', 'about a cat, I am not presently or actually sensing it. Nevertheless, when I think about\\n', 'a cat, I consider or suppose (or experience) the idea to be of a real cat existing at some\\n', 'place or some time. Maybe it is an idea of a chimerical or fictional cat, say, one with a\\n', 'horn in the front of its head, in which case my supposition turns out false. Or maybe\\n', 'the cat I am thinking of is the black one named “Cartman” that I left at home this\\n', 'morning, a really existing cat, one with which I am in some sort of causal relation. In\\n', 'this case, my supposition turns out to be true. In neither case, though, for Locke, am\\n', 'I justified in claiming that the cat I am thinking of is presently, or actually, external to\\n', 'me in this moment causing my idea. In order to make these additional claims, the\\n', 'other elements of an instance of sensitive knowledge must be added in.\\n', '\\n', 'Importantly, though, for now, we have the foundation for the agreement perceived\\n', '(the true proposition known) in an instance of sensitive knowledge: Owing to the\\n', 'idea of an object and an idea of existence we have in the mind an idea as of an existing\\n', '(outer) object. That is, owing to the complexity of the mental state in perceiving an\\n', 'idea of an object, we have an experience of an idea as of an existing object. I suggest\\n', 'that this is what Locke means when he begins the IV.ii.14 analysis of sensitive\\n', 'knowledge with the claim that we can be certain that we have in the mind an idea\\n', 'of an external object—not just an idea of an object, but of an external object. But\\n', 'notice that Locke makes this claim prior to questioning whether there really is an\\n', 'external object causing the idea. Thus, he must be thinking, and quite naturally so,\\n', 'that merely having an idea of an external object in the mind is not sufficient for\\n', 'sensitive knowledge. More justification is needed. Also, importantly, we have shown\\n', 'that sensitive knowledge satisfies the definition of knowledge as the perception of\\n', 'ideational agreement, understood propositionally, although we have yet to include all\\n', 'of the state of affairs constituting that knowledge and expressed in the complete\\n', 'proposition. We can now, as it were, build the state of affairs and thus the proposition\\n', 'from the bottom up by including the other elements on our list of Locke’s commit-\\n', 'ments until we have the complete state of affairs expressed in the proposition he uses\\n', 'in IV.i.7 to describe what we know when we have sensitive knowledge. Thus, we will\\n', 'see how each of the other of Locke’s commitments (the externalist justificatory\\n', 'element, the internalist justificatory element, and the present affectation of the\\n', 'senses) plays a role in having sensitive knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'Another way to see it is to say that we have now partially satisfied the agreement\\n', 'described in an instance of sensitive knowledge: “actual real Existence agreeing to an\\n', 'Idea” (IV.i.7). As we have seen, included along with an idea of an object is an idea of\\n', 'existence, giving me the experience of my idea as of an external object. But other\\n', 'conditions must be met in order to be able to say whether that object really exists or\\n', 'whether it actually/presently exists, namely those further features we see described in\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'the IV.i.7 definition. In order to have sensitive knowledge those additional elements\\n', 'must be given as a part of the complex mental state, to which I will return shortly. For\\n', 'now, simply note how Locke’s account of sensitive knowledge grows out of his\\n', 'account of how we know our own ideas. Because perceptual states are complex, we\\n', 'can have various forms of knowledge depending on the constituents of the mental\\n', 'state. Every perceptual state includes the original idea perceived, an idea of existence,\\n', 'and consciousness. No matter what the original idea perceived is, having these three\\n', 'constituents in the mind results in intuitive knowledge of the idea and of my\\n', 'existence. We now see that the same three constituents (as long as other conditions\\n', 'are also met) lead to an instance of sensitive knowledge. Let us move now to those\\n', 'other conditions justifying an instance of sensitive knowledge.\\n', '\\n', '3.II.3 From an Idea of an Object to the Real Existence\\n', 'of the Object\\n', 'As in the other two cases of knowing a particular thing (individual ideas and ourselves),\\n', 'we are explaining a state of affairs that is also the state of the proposition known. In an\\n', 'instance of sensitive knowledge of a particular external object that state of affairs begins\\n', 'with having an idea of an object and taking that object to be as of something external to\\n', 'me, which is expressed in the proposition that existence agrees to any idea. (Note that\\n', 'this proposition is embedded in the more complex one Locke is committed to in his\\n', 'IV.i.7 definition of the agreement known: “that of actual real Existence agreeing to any\\n', 'Idea.”) But there is nothing in the state of affairs expressed in the truncated proposition\\n', 'at this point precluding that the idea has no basis in a reality existing outside of us, even\\n', 'though we might experience it that way. So, let us consider, first, how we get from the\\n', 'perception of an idea of an object considered as external to us to the real existence of the\\n', 'object, one step farther to filling out the agreement perceived and the proposition\\n', 'known in having sensitive knowledge. I suggest that incorporating Locke’s commitment\\n', 'to an externalist justificatory element in having knowledge permits us to take that step.\\n', '\\n', 'For some ideas, the supposition of independent reality turns out to be true.\\n', '\\n', 'One place where Locke seems to treat the difference between a mere agreement of\\n', 'ideas and an agreement of ideas that has a basis in an external reality is in his IV.iv,\\n', 'discussion of the “Reality of Knowledge.” When it comes to having knowledge of\\n', 'general truths, Locke’s incorporation of an externalist justificatory element, that\\n', '“real” and “adequate” ideas are in a guaranteed conformity with their causes, gets\\n', 'us from knowledge simply as the perception of an agreement of ideas, to something\\n', 'more, what Locke calls “real Knowledge.” Although Locke’s specific aim in this\\n', 'chapter is not to justify our knowledge of the existence of a particular thing, namely\\n', 'sensitive knowledge, I take it to have some relevance, since having real knowledge is\\n', 'dependent on the relation individual ideas expressed in propositions bear to real\\n', 'things existing external to us.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'KNOWING THE EXISTENCE OF PARTICULAR EXTERNAL OBJECTS\\n', '\\n', 'Locke begins the chapter Of the Reality of our Knowledge with this:\\n', 'I Doubt not but my Reader, by this time, may be apt to think, that I have been all this while\\n', 'only building a Castle in the Air; and be ready to say to me, To what purpose all this stir?\\n', '\\n', 'Knowledge, say you, is only the perception of the agreement or disagreement of our own Ideas:\\n', 'but who knows what those Ideas may be?

Our Knowledge therefore is real, only so far as there is a conformity between our\\n', 'Ideas and the reality of Things. But what shall here be the Criterion? How shall the Mind, when\\n', 'it perceives nothing but its own Ideas, know that they agree with Things themselves? This,\\n', 'though it seems not to want difficulty, yet, I think there be two sorts of Ideas, that, we may be\\n', 'assured, agree with Things.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.iv.3)\\n', 'The two kinds of ideas that conform to real things are simple ideas and complex ideas\\n', 'not of substances: first, simple ideas, because “the Mind can by no means make\\n', '[simple ideas] to it self ” (IV.iv.4) and, second, complex ideas except those of\\n', 'substances, because “that which is designed to represent any thing but it self, can\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'never be capable of a wrong representation, nor mislead us from the true apprehen-\\n', 'sion of any thing, by its dislikeness to it” (IV.iv.5).69 Thus, our ideas conform to real\\n', 'things either if those ideas are the result of things operating on the mind rather than\\n', 'the product of the mind itself, or if they are a product of the mind, then they must not\\n', 'intend to represent or be a copy of something other than themselves. Notice, and this\\n', 'is important, that when our ideas can be said to conform to real things, it is because\\n', 'they satisfy certain factual conditions. Fulfilling conditions for the “true apprehen-\\n', 'sion” of a real thing concerns our relation to the cause of the idea and the complete-\\n', 'ness of the representation.\\n', '\\n', 'Locke’s descriptions of simple ideas and complex ideas of modes and relations as\\n', '“real” (II.xxx) and “adequate” (II.xxxi) include criteria distinctly similar to the\\n', 'reasons why they are candidates for agreements leading to “real knowledge.” In\\n', 'II.xxx.2, he claims that simple ideas have “all that is requisite to make them real,\\n', 'and not fictions at Pleasure. For in simple Ideas, . . . the Mind is wholly confined to the\\n', 'Operations of things upon it; and can make to it self no simple Idea, more than what\\n', 'it has received.” And in II.xxxi.1, Locke describes adequate ideas as those “which\\n', 'perfectly represent” those things the mind supposes them taken from. A simple idea\\n', '“cannot but be adequate, since it ought only to answer that power” that produced it\\n', '(II.xxxi.2). Alternatively, fictional ideas, for Locke, are complex ideas constructed by\\n', 'us that have no conformity “with that reality of Being, to which they are tacitly\\n', 'referr’d” (II.iii.1): a unicorn for example, or perhaps a similarly horned cat.70\\n', 'From the similarity of the language in his description of ideas that conform to real\\n', 'things and in his definitions of real and adequate ideas, it is reasonable to interpret\\n', 'Locke as thinking that whether or not our ideas “reach out” to something really\\n', 'existing outside us has to do with perceiving real and adequate ideas of sensation,\\n', 'namely those ideas to which we are passive and which we take to represent only the\\n', 'powers that produce them in us. Therefore, it is reasonable to think that having\\n', 'knowledge of the existence of particular external objects also requires that we have\\n', 'some justification that the ideas making up the agreement are real and adequate.\\n', '\\n', 'Note that meeting these criteria does not preclude the possibility that the real and\\n', '69 Complex ideas of substances cannot be known to conform to real things, “because we, knowing not\\n', 'what real Constitution it is of Substances, whereon our simple Ideas depend, and which really is the cause of the strict union of some of them one with another, and the exclusion of others; there are very few of them that we can be sure are, or are not inconsistent in Nature, any farther than Experience and sensible Observation reaches. . . . Which (as has been already shewed) will not be found to reach very far: But so far as it does, it will still be real Knowledge” (IV.iv.12). Where this has been already shown is in IV.iii.14. There, Locke states that we know only two necessary co-existences: “Figure necessarily supposes extension,” and\\n', '“receiving or communicating Motion by impulse, supposes Solidity.” As we will see, this does not preclude that the simple sensory ideas composing our complex ideas of substances “reach out” to real things.\\n', '\\n', '70 Because complex ideas of modes and relations, says Locke, have “no other reality than what they have in the Minds of Men” (II.xxx.4), all that is required to make them real is that their composition does not contain an inconsistency. Ideas of modes and relations are necessarily adequate, since they “are Voluntary Collections of simple Ideas, which the Mind puts together” (II.xxxi.3) and therefore are intended only to represent themselves.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'KNOWING THE EXISTENCE OF PARTICULAR EXTERNAL OBJECTS\\n', '\\n', 'adequate simple ideas of sensation I am perceiving right now are due to a dream or a\\n', 'memory. The question concerning these two constraints on having knowledge is\\n', 'whether my ideas meaningfully represent real things (causes) external to me that can\\n', 'or did exist regardless of whether those real things exist right now.71\\n', '3.II.3.1 Why simple ideas of sensation conform to their causes\\n', 'Locke explains that simple ideas of sensation are a part of the natural response we have\\n', 'to being affected by things through our senses. Such is the way in which God has\\n', 'created us: When external things impinge on us, we perceive simple ideas of primary\\n', 'and secondary qualities. They are “ordained by our Maker, to produce in us such\\n', 'Sensations; they are real Ideas in us, whereby we distinguish the Qualities, that are\\n', 'really in things themselves” (II.xxx.2). Because simple ideas of sensation are divinely\\n', 'designated effects of external causes affecting the senses, in performing their function,\\n', 'they necessarily correspond to those causes (things) they are designated to represent:\\n', 'For these several Appearances, being designed to be the Marks, whereby we are to know, and\\n', 'distinguish Things, which we have to do with; our Ideas do as well serve us to that purpose, and\\n', 'are as real distinguishing Characters, whether they be only constant Effects, or else exact\\n', 'Resemblances of something in the things themselves: the reality lying in that steady corres-\\n', 'pondence, they have with the distinct Constitutions of real Beings. But whether they answer to\\n', 'those Constitutions, as to Causes, or Patterns, it matters not; it suffices, that they are constantly produced by them. And thus our simple Ideas are all real and true, because they answer and\\n', 'agree to those Powers of Things, which produce them in our Minds, and that being all that is\\n', 'requisite to make them real, and not fictions at Pleasure. (II.xxx.2)\\n', 'The conformity to reality enjoyed by simple ideas, then, has nothing to do with how\\n', 'well they actually resemble the things for which they serve as marks. In fact, that a\\n', 'particular idea distinguishes a particular cause is in some respects an arbitrary\\n', 'decision of God’s. Rather, conformity consists in the regularity of the correspondence\\n', 'of an effect (idea) to a cause (power of a thing to produce the idea). So simple ideas\\n', 'mark the existence of the powers of real things to produce in us those ideas. As Locke\\n', 'states, they are “the Marks, whereby we are to know, and distinguish Things, which\\n', 'we have to do with.” Simple ideas correspond to really existing things as effects\\n', 'regularly correspond to causes, while “fantastical” ideas “have no Foundation in\\n', 'Nature, nor have any Conformity with that reality of Being, to which they are tacitly\\n', 'referr’d, as to their Archetypes” (II.xxx.1). Because fantastical ideas do not enjoy a\\n', '“steady correspondence” with those things they are taken to correspond to, they\\n', 'cannot be said to conform to reality.\\n', '\\n', 'Simple sensory ideas are all adequate, because they are perfect representations of\\n', 'the archetypes they are supposed or intended by the mind to represent:\\n', '71 Neither does it preclude that there is only a single cause, say, an evil demon. I address this issue partially in section 3.II.4 and more completely in part III. See also Bolton (2004a).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'Those I call Adequate, which perfectly represent those Archetypes, which the Mind supposes\\n', 'them taken from; which it intends them to stand for, and to which it refers them.

Indeed, the kind of relation Locke is talking about in his discussion of how\\n', 'adequate ideas conform to their archetypes fits awkwardly (if at all) with his\\n', 'discussion of the way in which our simple ideas of primary and secondary qualities\\n', 'do (or do not) resemble those qualities/powers in the objects causing our ideas.\\n', '\\n', 'Simple ideas are adequate because they just are the designated effects of particular\\n', 'causes—they are complete representations regardless of whether or not they resem-\\n', 'ble them.

Locke gives us the following example:\\n', 'For if Sugar produce in us the Ideas, which we call Whiteness, and Sweetness, we are sure there\\n', 'is a power in Sugar to produce those Ideas in our Minds, or else they could not have been\\n', 'produced by it. And so each Sensation answering the Power, that operates on any of our\\n', 'Senses, the Idea so produced, is a real Idea, (and not a fiction of the Mind, which has no power\\n', 'to produce any simple Idea;) and cannot but be adequate, since it ought only to answer that\\n', 'power: and so all simple Ideas are adequate.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxxi.2)\\n', '72 Complex ideas of substances are also inadequate insofar as we intend them to represent real essences (II.xxxi.6–7).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'KNOWING THE EXISTENCE OF PARTICULAR EXTERNAL OBJECTS\\n', '\\n', 'But what is the nature of this assurance that simple ideas reach out to their causes?\\n', '\\n', 'We can understand Locke to be saying that because we are passive recipients of the\\n', 'powers of things (whatever they may be) to produce these real and adequate ideas in\\n', 'us through our senses, we can be assured that they result from the things we are\\n', 'passive to. But that assurance is due to the way in which simple ideas necessarily\\n', 'fulfill the factual conditions (of regular correspondence and perfect representation)\\n', 'for conformity to their causes or archetypes—for conformity to the really existing\\n', 'powers that produce them.\\n', '\\n', 'Given Locke’s understanding of the reality and adequacy of simple sensory ideas,\\n', 'I suggest that analogously to our knowledge of general truths, when we have a simple\\n', 'sensory idea, there exists the possibility of “real” knowledge of a really existing\\n', 'thing.73 Locke distinguishes “real” knowledge here:\\n', 'Where-ever we perceive the Agreement or Disagreement of any of our Ideas, there is certain\\n', 'Knowledge: and where-ever we are sure those Ideas agree with the reality of Things, there is\\n', 'certain real Knowledge.

This is the way in which simple sensory ideas “reach out” to “something\\n', 'farther intended” (IV.iv.2). Locke confirms as much in this passage:\\n', 'for they [simple ideas] represent to us Things under those appearances which they are fitted to\\n', 'produce in us: whereby we are enabled to distinguish the sorts of particular Substances, to\\n', 'discern the states they are in, and so to take them for our Necessities, and apply them to our\\n', 'Uses.

[T]he idea’s descriptive content is the appearance the sensing produces . . . and so, by necessary complementation, the active power, as the thing represented through that appearance, is also contained in the idea.” I am not, though, necessarily committed to Hill’s further claim that “the power being exemplified and the idea being sensed are merely different descriptions of one and the same event.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'co-existing collection of powers to produce simple ideas. “Our complex Ideas of\\n', 'Substances,” says Locke, “being made all of them in reference to Things existing\\n', 'without us, and intended to be Representations of Substances, as they really are, are\\n', 'no farther real, than as they are such Combinations of simple Ideas, as are really\\n', 'united, and co-exist in Things without us” (II.xxx.5). If the idea of an external object\\n', 'is a real and adequate idea, which it is insofar as it is a collection of simple sensory\\n', 'ideas that represent a really co-existing collection of powers to produce those ideas,\\n', 'then I am justified in making the limited claim that I am perceiving an idea of\\n', 'something external to me that really exists (or existed).75 Insofar as my idea is real\\n', 'and adequate, no longer do I have to worry that the cat that I am now thinking about,\\n', 'the one I left at home this morning, is a fictional cat. In terms of the proposition\\n', 'expressing an instance of sensitive knowledge, including the externalist justificatory\\n', 'element takes us from “Existence agreeing to an Idea,” which would include fictions,\\n', 'to “real Existence agreeing to an Idea” (my emphasis in bold), which would not.\\n', '\\n', 'Remember, though, that sensitive knowledge is not just the assurance in virtue of\\n', 'their representational function that our sensory ideas reach out to real things.

To find this\\n', 'assurance, namely that the state of affairs expressed in Locke’s IV.i.7 proposition\\n', 'defining sensitive knowledge includes epistemic justification, we have to look to\\n', 'Locke’s commitment to an internalist justificatory element.

We have knowledge of the real\\n', 'existence of external objects when they are “actually operating” on us, “whilst” the\\n', 'paper is affecting our eyes, “at that time” that “the Objects are present to our Senses,”\\n', 'and when the testimony from the senses is the result of objects that “do then affect”\\n', 'us. Locke must be thinking that sensitive knowledge requires that the perceived idea\\n', 'of an object is an occurrent idea of sensation.\\n', '\\n', 'One might here be concerned that the sensory idea of the external object is not really\\n', 'occurrent, since it is a complex idea composed from a collection of simple ones.\\n', '\\n', 'Although Locke often speaks of our having ideas of external objects in his account of\\n', 'sensitive knowledge, which I also take to be a complex idea, he also tells us, “Though\\n', 'the qualities that affect our Senses, are, in the things themselves, so united and blended,\\n', 'that there is no separation, no distance between them; yet ’tis plain, the Ideas they\\n', 'produce in the Mind, enter by the Senses simple and unmixed” (II.ii.1). Of course, we\\n', 'do not usually experience being affected through the senses by each power/quality of\\n', 'the object individually. This might be why in explaining the individuality of simple\\n', 'ideas, Locke speaks of “the coldness and hardness, which a Man feels in a piece of Ice,”\\n', '“the Smell and Whiteness of a Lily,” and “the taste of Sugar, and smell of a Rose”\\n', '(II.ii.1). Moreover, and importantly, Locke thinks simple ideas enter the mind together,\\n', 'at the same time. For example, “Sight and Touch often take in from the same Object, at\\n', 'the same time, different Ideas; as a Man sees at once Motion and Colour; the hand feels\\n', 'Softness and Warmth in the same piece of Wax” (II.ii.1). So, even though our\\n', 'experience is of a whole external object affecting the senses, really it is a collection of\\n', 'occurrent simple ideas of sensation, all of which representationally capture their causes.\\n', '\\n', 'Locke seems to say as much in this passage about the scope of sensitive knowledge:\\n', 'But this Knowledge extends as far as the present Testimony of our Senses, employ’d about\\n', 'particular Objects, that do then affect them, and no farther. For if I saw such a collection of\\n', '76 See also IV.iii.21 and IV.iii.5.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'simple Ideas as is wont to be called a Man, existing together one minute since, and am now\\n', 'alone, I cannot be certain, that the same Man exists now, since there is no necessary connexion\\n', 'of his Existence a minute since, with his Existence now.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.xi.9)\\n', 'On my view, I have sensitive knowledge insofar as I am perceiving the “collection of\\n', 'simple Ideas as is wont to be called” an external object, namely the occurrent simple\\n', 'ideas of sensation. In some cases, I may perceive only a portion of the possible simple\\n', 'sensory ideas producible by any given object, say only the coldness and hardness, but\\n', 'not the bluish color of the piece of ice.

Therefore, for\\n', 'Locke, we have sensitive knowledge only when we are perceiving occurrent ideas of\\n', 'sensation—when we are actually being affected through the senses.\\n', '\\n', 'Second, just as we have externalist justification that the simple ideas of sensation\\n', 'collected in our idea of an object correspond to a real existence, Locke thinks that we\\n', 'also have internalist justification. To understand better how we have first-personal\\n', '(internal) justification, let us turn to Locke’s own description of our experience in\\n', 'having sensitive knowledge. As discussed earlier, Locke begins his IV.ii.14 discussion\\n', 'of it by differentiating sensitive knowledge from intuitive and demonstrative know-\\n', 'ledge. As well as the “Knowledge . . . of general Truths” that come by way of intuition\\n', 'and demonstration, “There is,” Locke says, “indeed, another Perception of the Mind,\\n', 'employ’d about the particular existence of finite Beings without us” (IV.ii.14). Sensitive\\n', 'knowledge consists in knowing that there exists a particular external object—or at\\n', 'least something to produce an idea of one. Locke’s explanation proceeds as follows.\\n', '\\n', 'First, “There can be nothing more certain, than that the Idea we receive from an\\n', 'external Object is in our Minds; this is intuitive Knowledge” (IV.ii.14). When we have\\n', 'an idea as of an external object we know that we do. We have intuitive knowledge of\\n', 'the idea. But on what grounds are we justified in claiming that that idea corresponds to\\n', 'something really existing external to us right now? Here is Locke’s answer:\\n', 'But yet here, I think, we are provided with an Evidence that puts us past doubting: For I ask any\\n', 'one, Whether he be not invincibly conscious to himself of a different Perception, when he\\n', 'looks on the Sun by day, and thinks on it by night; when he actually tastes Wormwood, or\\n', 'smells a Rose, or only thinks on that Savour, or Odour? We as plainly find the difference there\\n', 'is between any Idea revived in our Minds by our own Memory, and actually coming into our\\n', 'Minds by our Senses, as we do between any two distinct Ideas.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ii.14)\\n', 'One way to read this passage is to say that, when compared, ideas of sensation feel\\n', 'different to us than do ideas from memory. Then, on the basis of that knowledge we\\n', 'can draw an inference to the existence of the object.77 But remember that sensitive\\n', 'knowledge arises only when there is an occurrent idea of sensation—only when we are\\n', '77 See Newman (2004, 2007).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'KNOWING THE EXISTENCE OF PARTICULAR EXTERNAL OBJECTS\\n', '\\n', 'actually sensing. Therefore, the “evidence” Locke speaks of in this passage must be the\\n', 'result of, and so available only when we are, perceiving an occurrent sensory idea.\\n', '\\n', 'I suggest that Locke’s response is that we already have an internalist form of justifi-\\n', 'cation for sensitive knowledge in the perception of the idea of the object itself. It is a\\n', 'part of the complex mental state. That is, “whilst” I perceive an occurrent idea of the\\n', 'sun (or to use Locke’s example, “whilst” the paper in front of me is affecting my eyes\\n', '(IV.xi.2)), I cannot but experience the idea as originating in my senses.78 In such a\\n', 'case, I am conscious of the idea (the apparent intrinsic features of it) as from sensation.\\n', '\\n', 'I need not make an additional inference to the present existence of the object.79\\n', 'Similarly, I would just know that when I am thinking of the sun later that evening\\n', 'I am remembering the sun.

Remember\\n', 'what Locke says about memory: “the Mind has a Power . . . to revive Perceptions,\\n', 'which it has once had, with this additional Perception annexed to them, that it has\\n', 'had them before” (II.x.2). Evidence that by the “additional perception” Locke means\\n', 'consciousness is found in I.iv.20:\\n', 'For to remember is to perceive any thing with memory, or with a consciousness, that it was\\n', 'known or perceived before: without this, whatever Idea comes into the mind is new, and not\\n', 'remembered: This consciousness of it having been in the mind before, being that, which\\n', 'distinguishes Remembring from all other ways of Thinking.\\n', '\\n', 'Consciousness as internal to the perception of the revived idea accounts for our\\n', 'occurrent experience of the idea as from memory. Likewise, consciousness as internal\\n', 'to the perception of an occurrent idea of sensation accounts for our experience of the\\n', 'idea as from sensation. In being conscious of myself as perceiving the idea, I am\\n', 'conscious of the manner of perception. Moreover, this distinction between my\\n', 'experience of sensing, say, the sun, and remembering it later that night cannot be\\n', 'due to the object of the perception, since both ideas are of the sun. Both perceptions\\n', 'are of ideas of a really existing sun. Therefore, I have epistemic evidence for sensitive\\n', 'knowledge in my consciousness of the way of perceiving. That there actually exists\\n', 'something external to me affecting my senses is experienced as internal to the\\n', 'perception of the occurrent sensory idea. Because consciousness is a constituent of\\n', 'a perception of an idea, it is a part of the complex mental state. This ability to detect\\n', 'the sources of our ideas is not unfamiliar to contemporary cognitive scientists. Such\\n', 'experience of identifying phenomenal characteristics concerning what sort of mental\\n', 'state we are in, or where our mental states are coming from, as a part of that mental\\n', 'state itself is often called “source-monitoring.” According to Johnson (1998: 181),\\n', '78 Allen (2013), Weinberg (2013), and Nagel (forthcoming) all include internalist justification of this sort.\\n', '\\n', '79 Both Allen (2013) and Weinberg (2013) see sensitive knowledge as non-inferential. Wilson (2014:\\n', '13–14) argues that Allen’s inclusion of a reflective idea in the agreement perceived does not preclude that on his (Allen’s) account sensitive knowledge could be inferential.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', '“whether information is taken to be memories, knowledge, or reasonable beliefs is\\n', 'based on its phenomenal properties.”80\\n', 'But contrary to Allen (2013: 256–7) and Nagel (forthcoming), I do not (and as I will\\n', 'argue in section II.5, we should not) see the internal justificatory element as due to an\\n', 'idea of reflection. On my view, it is the complex mental state that is the perception of\\n', 'an occurrent idea of sensation that conveys sensitive knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'That consciousness is responsible for our experience of the way of perceiving gains\\n', 'support a few lines later when Locke concludes the IV.ii.14 description of sensitive\\n', 'knowledge with the following passage:\\n', 'So that, I think, we may add to the two former sorts of Knowledge, this also, of the existence of\\n', 'particular external Objects, by that perception and Consciousness we have of the actual\\n', 'entrance of Ideas from them, and allow these three degrees of Knowledge, viz. Intuitive,\\n', 'Demonstrative, and Sensitive: in each of which, there are different degrees and ways of\\n', 'Evidence and Certainty.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ii.14)\\n', 'Sensitive knowledge is due to the “perception and Consciousness we have of the actual\\n', 'entrance of Ideas.” We should take this passage to confirm the interpretation put\\n', 'forward. Because we are conscious of our ideas as having different sources, namely as\\n', 'being in the mind by different ways of perception, sensitive knowledge enjoys a degree of\\n', 'certainty that qualifies it as a species of knowledge. In addition, Locke says, “Where-ever\\n', 'the Mind perceives the Agreement or Disagreement of any of its Ideas, there be certain\\n', 'knowledge” (IV.ii.2). So perceiving the idea as from sensation is a part of the agreement\\n', 'constituting sensitive knowledge. Therefore, when we perceive an occurrent idea as of an\\n', 'external object (an occurrent collection of real and adequate simple ideas of sensation),\\n', 'we are justified in claiming that the real existence captured in the idea is presently\\n', '(actually) affecting our senses. Insofar as we are experiencing that complex mental state,\\n', 'we know the agreement constituting an instance of sensitive knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'Each element (or commitment) important to Locke’s account of sensitive know-\\n', 'ledge is now accounted for and can be seen as coherently expressed in the IV.i.7\\n', 'proposition describing the agreement (the true state of affairs) guaranteeing sensitive\\n', 'knowledge. The two ideas as required by the general definition of knowledge are an\\n', 'idea of an object and an accompanying idea of existence, giving us “existence agreeing\\n', 'to any Idea” or an experience as of an external object. That this idea (insofar as it is a\\n', 'collection of simple sensory ideas) is “real” and “adequate” provides a form of\\n', 'externalist justification that the existence we are talking about is “real Existence\\n', 'agreeing to any Idea.” That the occurrent idea as of an external object is consciously\\n', 'experienced as from sensation provides a form of internalist justification that the real\\n', 'existence we are talking about is “actual real Existence agreeing to any Idea,” which is\\n', '80 Nagel (forthcoming) notes this connection between Locke and contemporary accounts of “source-\\n', 'monitoring,” but she argues that it is due to a contemporaneous idea of reflection. Allen (2013: 259) considers the view that our ability to distinguish our ways of perceiving is due to something intrinsic to the perception of the idea, such as force or vivacity, but then rejects it.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'KNOWING THE EXISTENCE OF PARTICULAR EXTERNAL OBJECTS\\n', '\\n', 'the proposition Locke uses in IV.i.7 to express the agreement perceived (the true state\\n', 'of affairs) in an instance of sensitive knowledge.

Consistent\\n', 'with knowing our own ideas and knowing ourselves, I am again relying on Locke’s\\n', '“one-act” view of knowledge wherein knowing agreements does not require a\\n', 'separate act of the mind: perceiving the agreement, forming the proposition, and\\n', 'knowing it to be true are all achieved as a part of the same mental act. Moreover, we\\n', 'know agreements internal to the perception of an idea because those perceptions are\\n', 'complex mental states with constituent agreeing elements: an idea perceived, an idea\\n', 'of existence, and consciousness. Perceptions of ideas are complex propositional\\n', 'states. As already established, as the result of this complexity when I perceive any\\n', 'idea, I have intuitive knowledge of the idea and of my own existence. When the idea\\n', 'perceived is an occurrent idea of sensation, in addition, I have sensitive knowledge,\\n', 'namely knowledge of the actual real existence of the particular object represented by\\n', 'the idea, or more accurately, by the collection of simple sensory ideas. Therefore, the\\n', 'role of consciousness as a constituent of a more complex mental state makes possible\\n', 'that we are able to have knowledge of particular things, namely perceive the agree-\\n', 'ments in knowing an individual idea, in knowing our own existence, and in knowing\\n', 'the existence of a particular finite thing outside of me as Locke describes them.

I will assume that sensitive knowledge, like intuitive knowledge, is immediate and non-inferential, i.e. that Locke assumes that it involves no process of reasoning.” There is looming, however, the problem of finding logical space for sensitive knowledge, given Locke’s definitions of intuitive knowledge as non-inferential and demonstrative knowledge as inferential. I will address this problem in part III of this chapter.\\n', '\\n', '82 The only other particular thing we have knowledge of, for Locke, is God’s existence.

First, Locke himself does not seem to think sensitive\\n', 'knowledge is immune to an evil demon doubt. In response to more pressure from the\\n', 'skeptic after his explanation that our experience of sensing provides sufficient\\n', '“evidence” for sensitive knowledge, he replies:\\n', 'If any one say, a Dream may do the same thing, and all these Ideas may be produced in us,\\n', 'without any external Objects; he may please to dream that I make him this Answer: 1.

What is more, it explains how the state of affairs\\n', 'guaranteeing the truth of the proposition known is also the composition or structure\\n', 'of the true proposition itself.

Let us see why. Were\\n', 'we to see “the idea of actual sensation” as a reflective idea, three interpretations are\\n', 'possible, none of which comes without significant cost. On the one hand, the reflective\\n', 'idea can be generated just after having the idea of sensation. That is, immediately\\n', 'following the perception of an idea of sensation there would be a reflection on that\\n', 'mental operation of sensing resulting in the reflective idea of sensation. Having to\\n', 'reflect on my present sensation in order to generate the “idea of actual sensation”\\n', 'would require an additional mental act following the experience of sensing itself. But\\n', 'this reading contradicts those passages in which Locke states that we have sensitive\\n', 'knowledge in the moment, or only when, we are being presently affected through\\n', 'the senses.86\\n', '85 Newman (2004, 2007), Rickless (2008), and Nagel (forthcoming). Allen (2013) argues that the\\n', 'agreement is between a reflective idea of sensation and an idea of an actual real existence.\\n', '\\n', '86 See, again, IV.ii.5, IV.iii.21, IV.xi.2, and IV.xi.9.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'On the other hand, we could interpret Locke as saying that the (reflective) idea of\\n', 'actual sensation is brought into contemporaneity with the idea of the external cause.\\n', '\\n', 'But then the idea would be of a past experience of sensing, namely from memory,\\n', 'which is something Locke emphatically denies in a statement to Stillingfleet just prior\\n', 'to the passage cited above:\\n', 'But if you had been pleased to have considered my answer there to the sceptics, whose cause\\n', 'you seem, with no small vigour, to manage; you would, I humbly conceive, have found that you\\n', 'mistake one thing for another, viz. the idea that has by a former sensation been lodged in the\\n', 'mind, for actually receiving any idea, i.e. actual sensation.\\n', '\\n', '(Works, IV: 360)\\n', 'Here Locke is clear that he does not mean “actual sensation” to refer to a reflective idea\\n', 'that has been generated at some other time and retrieved from memory, namely an\\n', '“idea that has by a former sensation been lodged in the mind” (my emphasis). Rather,\\n', 'he seems to confirm that “actual sensation” refers to an occurrent idea of sensation.\\n', '\\n', 'On the third hand, one can argue as does Nagel (forthcoming) that in being\\n', 'conscious of a sensory idea there is occurrently generated a reflective idea of sensation,\\n', 'which if successful would escape my other two objections.87 I do not, however, think it\\n', 'is successful, for in making that argument Nagel has identified consciousness with the\\n', 'mental operation of reflection, which results in a textual conflict between Locke’s\\n', 'claims that all perception is conscious (II.i.19, II.i.25), but young children do not yet\\n', 'have ideas of reflection (II.i.8). So Nagel must find herself either contradicting Locke’s\\n', 'explicit position concerning the reflective abilities of young children or as denying\\n', 'that young children have sensitive knowledge. Recognizing that Locke disallows\\n', 'reflection in young children, Nagel (forthcoming) takes the second route: “It is a\\n', 'consequence of the view suggested here that very small children with no ideas of\\n', 'reflection whatsoever will not have sensitive knowledge; to the extent that very small\\n', 'children are poor judges of the distinction between reality and fantasy this might not\\n', 'be an unwelcome result.” But this solution is unavailable to Nagel, for her interpret-\\n', 'ation actually entails that young children have sensitive knowledge. The reason is that\\n', 'Locke is committed to the view that young children have what in II.i.25 he calls\\n', '“obscure Notions” of their own thinking.

At least, I think, the most charitable way to read him is that the idea of reflection is generated occurrently when we have an idea as the result of being affected through the senses.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'KNOWING THE EXISTENCE OF PARTICULAR EXTERNAL OBJECTS\\n', '\\n', 'Locke’s claim that “no man,” namely no one, “can be ignorant of what he does when\\n', 'he thinks” is just his view that all thinking, regardless of the thinker, is conscious.\\n', '\\n', 'As first recognized by Kulstad (1991), if all thinking is conscious, and the obscure\\n', 'notions are ideas of reflection, then consciousness is identified with reflection.\\n', '\\n', 'Because young children are conscious, they must be having ideas of reflection—\\n', 'contrary to Locke’s view.\\n', '\\n', 'Next, consider Nagel’s view. After citing the famous IV.ii.14 passage in which\\n', 'Locke claims that we can just tell the difference between an occurrent sensation of the\\n', 'sun and a memory of the sun, Nagel explicitly equates the “obscure Notions” in II.\\n', '\\n', 'i.25 with ideas of reflection:\\n', 'Locke claims here that the character of our present mode of thought, whether sensation or\\n', 'recollection, is always available to us: we are “invincibly conscious” of the way in which any\\n', 'given idea is presenting itself to us, as well as the content of the idea presented. Earlier in the Essay Locke had advanced the milder claim that “the operations of our minds, will not let us be\\n', 'without, at least some obscure Notions of them” (2.1.25); it now seems that even these obscure\\n', 'notions must always be distinct enough that there is no risk of our mistaking recollection for\\n', 'sensation. The perception one enjoys when seeing the sun is different from the perception\\n', 'involved in recollecting it, not in virtue of any of the sensible qualities the sun is represented as having, but in virtue of one’s own current mode of thought, of the operations of one’s mind.\\n', '\\n', 'The operations of the mind generate what Locke calls ideas of reflection.

Locke is often accused of having an “insouciant” attitude toward the\\n', 'problem, which is even more puzzling given his textual commitments to a represen-\\n', 'tational theory of perception with the ensuing “veil of ideas.” If ideas are the imme-\\n', 'diate objects of perception, and knowledge is internal to ideas, then why would he\\n', 'want to insist that we have sensitive knowledge at all? More natural would be to take\\n', 'the skeptical problem seriously by concluding that all we really achieve is highly\\n', 'probable judgment that the causes of our ideas really do exist when we are sensing\\n', 'them. But he does not. Locke claims that sensitive knowledge is a species of knowledge\\n', 'with a degree of certainty. What is more, although Locke claims that sensitive\\n', 'knowledge counts as a species of knowledge, rather than a species of judgment, he\\n', 'also seems to offer a series of probabilistic arguments in defense of sensitive know-\\n', 'ledge.

To get started, notice that we can see the skeptical challenge in two ways.\\n', '\\n', 'First, we can see the skeptic as asking how we can know the existence of external things.\\n', '\\n', 'Second, we can see the skeptic as asking more specifically how we can know inferentially\\n', 'of the existence of external things. That is, given a representational theory of perception,\\n', 'what reason do we have to think that the ideas we perceive really do represent an\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'external world? I have argued that Locke’s account of sensitive knowledge provides an\\n', 'answer to the first question, which reveals that the second question is based on a false\\n', 'presupposition. The reason is that sensitive knowledge, for Locke, is a form of non-\\n', 'inferential knowledge. We know the agreement constituting sensitive knowledge as\\n', 'internal to the perception of an idea due to the complexity of our perceptual states. As\\n', 'far as the existence of particular outer things is concerned, all we can achieve by\\n', 'inference is highly probable judgment. Therefore, the probabilistic arguments Locke\\n', 'provides should not be understood as Locke’s defense of the claim that sensitive\\n', 'knowledge counts as knowledge. Rather they should be seen more as Locke describes\\n', 'them—as “concurrent” reasons to shore up what we already sensitively (non-\\n', 'inferentially) know. It is unusual, I admit, to speak of buttressing knowledge with\\n', 'probabilistic arguments. But it is also unusual, as Locke has it, for knowledge to come\\n', 'in degrees according to certainty and for one of those degrees to fall somewhere in\\n', 'between probability and knowledge proper. Locke’s reply to the skeptical challenge,\\n', 'I suggest, is found in his analysis of the different degrees of knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'Interpreting sensitive knowledge as non-inferential, though, seems to saddle Locke\\n', 'with an internal incoherence, a potential problem that, as promised, I will now\\n', 'address. Unfortunately, despite Locke’s claims that we actually do have “knowledge\\n', 'of the real existence of particular finite beings without us” (IV.ii.14, IV.xi.3), and the\\n', 'arguments marshaled so far in defense of the agreement and how we perceive it, he\\n', 'seems to have left no logical space for it. Agreements perceived immediately (without\\n', 'intervening ideas) are intuitive, while agreements perceived mediately (requiring\\n', 'intervening ideas) are demonstrative. Locke seems to be aware of the problem in\\n', 'IV.ii.14, when he states “These two, (viz.) Intuition and Demonstration, are the\\n', 'degrees of our Knowledge; whatever comes short of one of these, with what assurance\\n', 'soever embraced, is but Faith, or Opinion, but not Knowledge.” He then adds, “at\\n', 'least in all general Truths,” which suggests that when the proposition is not general,\\n', 'as would be the case with a proposition asserting the real existence of a particular\\n', 'external object, it can count as knowledge although it falls short of intuition and\\n', 'demonstration. But still Locke has gained no ground.\\n', '\\n', 'The problem for the scholarship is that it seems impossible to maintain coherently\\n', 'that there can be three kinds of knowledge when there are only two ways in which\\n', 'agreements can be perceived, immediately, which is intuitive knowledge, and with the\\n', 'help of intervening ideas, which is demonstrative knowledge.88 Others have tried to\\n', 'address this difficulty in different ways. Newman (2004, 2007: 325) argues that in\\n', 'sensitive knowledge there are two different cognitions: “an idea of sensation stands in\\n', 'dual cognitive relations: it stands both in a perceived agreement with another idea, and\\n', '88 See also Rickless (forthcoming) for specific arguments against both Nagel and Allen. Rickless (2008: 100 and forthcoming) argues that sensitive knowledge is not knowledge at all, but, rather, a judgment or presumption reaching “assurance” or the highest degree of probability. I address some problems with Rickless’s interpretation in section 3.III.3.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'SENSITIVE KNOWLEDGE AND THE SKEPTICAL CHALLENGE\\n', '\\n', 'in a causal relation with an external cause. Though cognition of the former relation\\n', 'explains why sensitive knowledge ‘passes under the name of Knowledge,’ cognition of\\n', 'the latter relation is integral and yet could pass for nothing stronger than probable\\n', 'judgment.” As noted by Rickless (2008: 91), Newman’s interpretation is philosophically\\n', 'shaky because it runs contrary to Locke’s emphatic philosophical distinction between\\n', 'knowledge and probable judgment or opinion. In addition, that there are “dual cogni-\\n', 'tive relations” in the same act of knowledge is textually thin. Nagel (forthcoming) argues\\n', 'that the agreement perceived—what constitutes knowledge—consists in “an agreement\\n', 'between the reflective idea of sensation and the idea of the real existence of an outer\\n', 'cause.” The reason why sensitive knowledge is less certain is that the “connection\\n', 'between the central content presented to one’s mind (in this case, the idea of the rose\\n', '[external object]) and one’s idea of one’s mode of thought (in this case, the [reflective]\\n', 'idea of actual sensation) . . . is one of mere temporal coincidence.” For Allen (2013: 262),\\n', 'sensitive knowledge is less certain, because “even when we are actually receiving ideas\\n', 'from without, a particular kind of doubt remains possible. . . . Whereas reason is\\n', 'employed about the ‘clear and abstract Ideas of our own Minds’ (E IV.xi.3), the reflective\\n', 'awareness of receiving ideas from without can be rendered indistinct and obscure by a\\n', 'failure to attend carefully to our own mental lives.” I pointed to problems I see with\\n', 'Nagel’s and Allen’s interpretations in part II of this chapter.\\n', '\\n', 'I have argued that the agreement in sensitive knowledge is perceived immediately\\n', '(non-inferentially), and I think there is a relatively easy way to allow three kinds of\\n', 'knowledge when there are only two ways of perceiving agreements. All that is needed is\\n', 'a slight change in taxonomy. Had Locke been more careful about what, in the end, he\\n', 'was committed to, he would (and should) have said the following: (1) all knowledge is\\n', 'the perception of an agreement or disagreement of ideas; (2) there are two ways of\\n', 'perceiving agreements or disagreements of ideas: immediately (non-inferentially) or\\n', 'mediately (inferentially); (3) intuitive and sensitive knowledge fall into the first category,\\n', 'while demonstrative knowledge falls into the second; (4) the degrees of certainty of\\n', 'knowledge can then depend on how well each form of knowledge meets other condi-\\n', 'tions. (I will argue that the other conditions are further normative conditions.)89\\n', 'Although this analysis might seem both tendentious and costly to the interpretation,\\n', 'I suggest that all it does is to swap the definitional terms. Instead of using “intuitive” and\\n', '“demonstrative” to denote ways of perceiving agreements (immediately and mediately),\\n', 'it uses “non-inferential” and “inferential.” Making this interpretive move makes sense of\\n', 'everything Locke says, except his use of “intuitive” exclusively to denote a non-\\n', 'inferential perception of an agreement of ideas. This is a more satisfying solution,\\n', 'since it allows Locke all that he wants in his theory of knowledge. He can have his\\n', 'general definition of knowledge that also “allow[s] these three degrees of Knowledge,\\n', '89 As will become clear, the further normative conditions are in addition to those requirements for the agreement in sensitive knowledge established in part II. The arguments for both psychological and\\n', 'normative conditions on knowledge are also found in Weinberg (2013).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'viz. Intuitive, Demonstrative, and Sensitive: in each of which there are different degrees\\n', 'and ways of Evidence and Certainty” (IV.ii.14).\\n', '\\n', 'Here, in part III, I will argue that Locke’s theory of knowledge includes both first-\\n', 'order psychological and second-order normative conditions. Having knowledge at all\\n', 'depends on whether the first-order psychological conditions are met, namely those\\n', 'conditions on the agreement constituting sensitive knowledge as established in part II.\\n', '\\n', 'The degree of certainty we have in the different forms of knowledge depends on how\\n', 'well each “degree” of knowledge (intuitive, demonstrative, and sensitive) meets\\n', 'further second-order (reflective) normative conditions. In advancing my case that\\n', 'sensitive knowledge is a form of non-inferential knowledge, I will draw out Locke’s\\n', 'own implicit analogy between intuitive and sensitive knowledge. By comparing both\\n', 'the similarities in the way in which each one meets the psychological conditions and\\n', 'the differences in the way in which they meet normative conditions, I can show why\\n', 'both sensitive and intuitive knowledge are the immediate (non-inferential) perception\\n', 'of an agreement of ideas, but at the same time they do not have the same certainty.\\n', '\\n', 'Unlike intuitive knowledge, sensitive knowledge does not meet a higher order nor-\\n', 'mative condition. Should I step back from my sensitive knowledge and reflectively ask\\n', 'whether I should still accept what I have just immediately perceived, I can generate a\\n', 'reason for doubt. Hence, sensitive knowledge has a lesser degree of certainty. But it is\\n', 'still knowledge—at least for Locke. Therefore, not all knowledge, for Locke, must meet\\n', 'the same epistemic conditions. The psychological condition, namely the perception of\\n', 'an agreement and the subjective certainty experienced therein, constitutes knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'But the degree of certainty of that knowledge depends upon whether (and how well)\\n', 'further epistemic conditions are met. I suggest that the similarities and differences in\\n', 'the degrees of knowledge and the ways in which they meet these conditions constitute\\n', 'Locke’s reply to the skeptical challenge. Although the bulk of the arguments address\\n', 'only intuitive and sensitive knowledge, I will also have something to say about why\\n', 'Locke’s understanding of demonstrative knowledge is consistent with the interpret-\\n', 'ation I put forward.\\n', '\\n', 'I have already provided ample textual reasons for attributing to Locke the view\\n', 'that sensitive knowledge counts as a species of knowledge. Let me reiterate some of\\n', 'the main ones here. First, Locke tells us, “We can have Knowledge no farther than we\\n', 'have Ideas” (IV.iii.1). Second, Locke “allow[s] these three degrees of Knowledge, viz.\\n', '\\n', 'Intuitive, Demonstrative, and Sensitive” (IV.ii.14). Third, sensitive knowledge is a\\n', 'species of the knowledge of “real existence” (IV.i.1, IV.iii.21). Fourth, Locke defines\\n', 'knowledge as “the perception of the connexion and agreement, or disagreement and\\n', 'repugnancy of any of our Ideas” (IV.i.2), and finally, “where-ever the Mind perceives\\n', 'the Agreement or Disagreement of any of its Ideas, there be certain Knowledge”\\n', '(IV.ii.2). These passages clearly indicate that a necessary and sufficient condition of\\n', 'knowledge (generally) is that there is the perception of an agreement of ideas, and\\n', 'that all knowledge is certain. Furthermore, in part II we saw that Locke’s definition of\\n', 'the agreement in sensitive knowledge can be reconciled with the general definition\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'SENSITIVE KNOWLEDGE AND THE SKEPTICAL CHALLENGE\\n', '\\n', 'of knowledge. So, Locke must be thinking that in a case of sensitive knowledge there\\n', 'is an agreement perceived, and it enjoys (at least some degree of) certainty.\\n', '\\n', 'What is more, I take Locke to be concerned to delimit what he counts as\\n', 'knowledge from what he considers probability. Locke describes his project as one\\n', 'of “search[ing] out the bounds between opinion and knowledge” (I.i.3). He states his\\n', 'purpose “to inquire into the original, certainty, and extent of human knowledge,\\n', 'together with the grounds and degrees of belief, opinion, and assent” (I.i.2). This\\n', 'mission in combination with the above textual statements about what knowledge in\\n', 'general and sensitive knowledge in particular consist in is good evidence that he\\n', 'considers sensitive knowledge to count as knowledge and not a degree of “belief,\\n', 'opinion, and assent.” My concern, now, is only with why, once sensitive knowledge is\\n', 'seen as knowledge, Locke responds to the skeptical challenge as he does. Part III offers\\n', 'a way to understand Locke’s treatment of the skeptical question, given that all\\n', 'knowledge, including sensitive knowledge, is internal to ideas. In addition, the\\n', 'interpretation underscores Locke’s own description of his task, not to show that we\\n', 'can know all that we may want to know, but rather to show that human understand-\\n', 'ing can provide knowledge sufficient for what we need to know.\\n', '\\n', '3.III.1 Locke’s Epistemic Task\\n', 'To provide an appropriate frame for the interpretation I am advancing, it is helpful to\\n', 'think about the nature of what I am calling Locke’s “epistemic task” in the Essay. In\\n', 'the “Epistle to the Reader,” Locke relates the birth of the Essay. As he tells it, he was\\n', 'discussing matters of important concern with several friends when they came to the\\n', 'realization that they were unable to reach satisfactory solutions. Locke says,\\n', 'After we had a while puzzled our selves, without coming any nearer a resolution of those Doubts\\n', 'which perplexed us, it came to my thoughts that we took a wrong course; and that, before we set\\n', 'our selves upon Enquiries of that Nature, it was necessary to examine our own Abilities, and see,\\n', 'what Objects our Understandings were, or were not fitted to deal with. (Locke 1975: 7)\\n', 'According to the testimony of his contemporary, James Tyrrell, Locke and his friends\\n', 'were discussing matters of morality and revealed religion.90 Locke wanted to know\\n', 'whether the understanding is “fitted to deal with” important issues concerning our\\n', 'knowledge of God and how we ought to live. Are we fit to achieve the practical goals\\n', 'of happiness in this life and the next? Locke’s answer, after all the subsequent hard\\n', 'work in the Essay, is that although there are a number of things we cannot know,\\n', 'such as the nature of substance, the full mechanistic account of nature, and whether\\n', 'thinking substance is material or immaterial, we can know enough to make our way\\n', 'through those puzzling issues that most concern us:\\n', '90 This claim seems uncontroversial. See Cranston (1957), Colman (1983: ch. 1), Wolterstorff (1996: 1), Jolley (1999: 3), and Woolhouse (2007: 98).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'For though the Comprehension of our Understandings, comes exceeding short of the vast\\n', 'Extent of Things; yet, we shall have Cause enough to magnify the bountiful Author of our\\n', 'Being, for that Portion and degree of Knowledge, he has bestowed on us, so far above all the\\n', 'rest of the Inhabitants of this our Mansion.

I suggest that Locke’s general point is that the\\n', 'faculties we have are sufficient for pursuing and gaining the kind of knowledge that is\\n', 'crucial to living a good life.

For the degree of certainty can track the extent to which we\\n', 'are capable of achieving it.\\n', '\\n', 'Locke’s division of knowledge into three degrees of certainty can be taken as his reply\\n', 'to the skeptic’s charge that we cannot claim to have knowledge of an external world. The\\n', 'reason is that Locke can be seen to employ different cognitive standpoints in his\\n', 'treatment of the certainty of knowledge and so also in his treatment of skepticism. In\\n', 'resting content with the unavoidable certainty in perceptions of agreements of ideas\\n', 'constituting knowledge, yet acknowledging the possibility of a change in one’s epistemic\\n', 'situation upon a reflective consideration, we can make sense of Locke’s claim that\\n', 'sensitive knowledge counts as (a lesser degree of certainty of) knowledge.

Let us turn now to making explicit\\n', 'Locke’s own implicit analogy between intuitive and sensitive knowledge.\\n', '\\n', '3.III.2 The Similarity of Intuitive and Sensitive\\n', 'Knowledge: The Nature of Intuitive Knowledge\\n', 'We have just seen that there is a structural similarity in knowing our own ideas,\\n', 'knowing our own existence, and knowing the existence of an external object. In all\\n', 'three cases, owing to the complexity of our perceptual states, we know these agree-\\n', 'ments internal to the perception of an idea. Moreover, these forms of knowledge do\\n', 'not require a mental act in addition to the perception of the idea itself. But sensitive\\n', 'knowledge also shares more general psychological features with all forms of intuitive\\n', 'knowledge, even those general truths in which we know propositions as the result of\\n', 'voluntarily comparing ideas. Three other important similarities emerge between\\n', 'intuitive knowledge generally and sensitive knowledge. First, all intuitive knowledge,\\n', 'like sensitive knowledge, is immediate both logically and temporally. Second, both\\n', 'intuitive and sensitive knowledge are irresistible and unavoidable. And third, Locke\\n', 'seems to think that both resist what he calls an “earnest” skeptical attitude.\\n', '\\n', 'Establishing the analogy between intuitive and sensitive knowledge serves three\\n', 'purposes. First, it yields further support for the arguments in part I of this chapter by\\n', 'showing that having intuitive knowledge internal to the perception of an idea is\\n', 'consistent with other features common to all cases of intuitive knowledge. Second, it\\n', 'strengthens my arguments in parts I and II by showing that the structural similarity\\n', 'in knowing the agreement in the intuitive knowledge of my own ideas and my own\\n', 'existence, and in an instance of sensitive knowledge, is consistent with other\\n', 'psychological features similar to both intuitive and sensitive knowledge. Third,\\n', 'explicating the additional shared psychological features of intuitive and sensitive\\n', 'knowledge is helpful in distinguishing their dissimilarities, namely answering the\\n', 'crucial question how two forms of non-inferential knowledge can differ in degree\\n', 'of certainty.\\n', '\\n', 'Let us move on to the analogy. Consider first Locke’s description of the immediacy\\n', 'of intuitive knowledge.91 First, knowing the identity of an idea (as we saw in part I) is\\n', '91 Remember that Locke’s use of the term “immediately” to describe the way in which agreements can\\n', 'be known is not meant to carry the more contemporary meaning of “direct perceptual access” or\\n', '“unmediated” by an idea. As noted previously, Locke states elsewhere that “the Mind, in all its Thoughts and Reasonings, hath no other immediate Object, but its own ideas” (IV.i.1) and also that “the Mind knows not Things immediately, but only by the intervention of the Ideas it has of them” (IV.iv.3). So, “immediacy,” for Locke, does not mean that we have knowledge beyond our ideas (IV.iii.1).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'an immediate form of knowledge: “A Man infallibly knows, as soon as ever he has\\n', 'them in his Mind that the Ideas he calls White and Round, are the Ideas they are”\\n', '(IV.i.4). This knowledge is internal to the perception of the idea. But also when Locke\\n', 'explains the nature of intuitive knowledge more generally, he states that we perceive\\n', 'the agreement or disagreement of ideas “immediately by themselves, without the\\n', 'intervention of any other.” Thus, we perceive\\n', 'that White is not Black, That a Circle is not a Triangle, That Three are more than Two, and\\n', 'equal to One and Two. Such kind of Truths the mind perceives at the first sight of the Ideas\\n', 'together, by bare Intuition, without the intervention of any other Idea; and this kind of\\n', 'Knowledge is the clearest, and most certain, that humane Frailty is capable of.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ii.1)\\n', 'Locke seems to be speaking of the “immediacy” of intuitive knowledge in two ways.\\n', '\\n', 'First, there is logical immediacy in the sense that no other ideas than those originally\\n', 'perceived (or compared) are necessary to know the agreement.92 Indeed, Locke specific-\\n', 'ally uses the term “immediately” to distinguish this difference between intuitive and\\n', 'demonstrative knowledge. In demonstrative knowledge, “the Mind perceives the Agree-\\n', 'ment or Disagreement of any Ideas, but not immediately” (IV.ii.2). Demonstrative\\n', 'knowledge, for Locke, is knowledge by proofs, which requires intervening ideas to show\\n', 'the agreement or disagreement of any ideas. “Those intervening Ideas, which serve to\\n', 'shew the Agreement of any two others, are called Proofs; and where the Agreement or\\n', 'Disagreement is by this means plainly and clearly perceived, it is called Demonstration”\\n', '(IV.ii.3).93 I suggest that we see logical immediacy as a feature of intuitive knowledge\\n', 'generally that distinguishes it from demonstrative knowledge, but not from sensitive\\n', 'knowledge. Therefore, that all intuitive and sensitive knowledge can be seen to share\\n', 'certain features, for example logical immediacy, does not mean that we cannot within\\n', 'Locke’s theory of knowledge distinguish them insofar as they do not share other features.\\n', '\\n', 'Indeed, I will argue that how well intuitive and sensitive knowledge (as well as demon-\\n', 'strative knowledge) stand up to a reflective challenge is one such distinguishing feature.\\n', '\\n', 'Second, Locke also seems to think all intuitive knowledge is temporally immediate in\\n', 'the sense that there is no temporal gap between perceiving the ideas and perceiving any\\n', 'agreement or disagreement therein.94 We see this in Locke’s use of temporal terms like\\n', '“as soon as ever” he has ideas in the mind he has knowledge, “whilst” having an idea we\\n', '92 I have defined logical immediacy in this way in order to rule out cases in which the agreement is part of a more complex argument or proof, which we would naturally want to count as a case of demonstration rather than intuition.\\n', '\\n', '93 Remember also “in every step Reason makes in demonstrative Knowledge, there is an intuitive\\n', 'Knowledge of that Agreement or Disagreement” (IV.ii.7).\\n', '\\n', '94 For Locke, remember, the understanding just is the power of perception (II.vi.2). Of course, one would want to distinguish the perception in judging as the “presumption” of an agreement of ideas from the perception in “knowing” an agreement of ideas. But Locke is not always as precise as we would like him to be. For example, we see Locke using “perception” in IV.ii.6 to refer to cases both of knowing and of not knowing. It is also controversial whether his use of “judgment” (as a kind of perception) in II.ix.8 is consistent with his use of it in IV.xiv–xv. (For more on this, see the latter part of note 101.)\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'SENSITIVE KNOWLEDGE AND THE SKEPTICAL CHALLENGE\\n', '\\n', 'know something, and we have knowledge “without hesitation” to describe how we have\\n', 'intuitive knowledge. Moreover, these two kinds of immediacy seem, for Locke, related.\\n', '\\n', 'The reason why a form of knowledge is instantaneously self-evident derives from the\\n', 'fact that I know the agreement as a part of perceiving ideas themselves as compared or\\n', 'juxtaposed in the understanding. For example, when I perceive an idea of white and\\n', 'I perceive (compare) an idea of black, logically, I have an immediate knowledge of their\\n', 'disagreement, since I can perceive it without the need for any intervening ideas. What\\n', 'we find in IV.ii.5 provides a good illustration. Here, Locke says, “And so if the Mind\\n', 'have the Faculty of distinct Perception, it will perceive the Agreement or Disagreement\\n', 'of Ideas that produce intuitive Knowledge.” Distinct perception is not enough in cases\\n', 'where the agreement cannot be perceived immediately. Locke says:\\n', 'Thus having the Ideas of an obtuse, and an acute Triangle, both drawn from equal Bases, and\\n', 'between Parallels, I can by intuitive Knowledge, perceive the one not to be the other; but\\n', 'cannot that way know, whether they be equal, or no; because their Agreement, or Disagree-\\n', 'ment in equality, can never be perceived by an immediate comparing them: The difference of\\n', 'Figure makes their parts uncapable of an exact immediate application; and therefore there is\\n', 'need of some intervening Quantities to measure them by, which is Demonstration, or rational\\n', 'Knowledge.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.iii.3)\\n', 'Moreover, when I perceive those ideas together I know instantaneously—“at first\\n', 'sight”—that, for example, “white is not black.”\\n', 'Consider also, again, this passage in which Locke describes our intuitive know-\\n', 'ledge of our own ideas:\\n', '’Tis the first Act of the Mind, when it has any Sentiments or Ideas at all, to perceive its Ideas,\\n', 'and so far as it perceives them, to know each what it is, and thereby also to perceive their\\n', 'difference, and that one is not another. This is so absolutely necessary, that without it there\\n', 'could be no knowledge, no Reasoning, no Imagination, no distinct Thoughts at all. By this the\\n', 'Mind clearly and infallibly perceives each Idea to agree with it self, and not to be the other: and it does this without any pains, labour, or deduction; but at first view, by its natural power of\\n', 'Perception and Distinction. . . . A Man infallibly knows, as soon as ever he has them in his\\n', 'Mind that the Ideas he calls White and Round, are the Ideas they are, and that they are not\\n', 'other Ideas which he calls Red or Square.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.i.4)\\n', 'Here Locke says that when I have a distinct idea, insofar as I perceive that idea,\\n', 'I know what it is, solely by the mind’s natural power of “Perception and Distinction.”\\n', 'As argued in part I, insofar as I perceive any idea distinctly, I know “what it is.” I need\\n', 'not worry that when I perceive the idea “white” or the idea “black” I actually have\\n', 'some other ideas in my mind, say the idea “red” or the idea “round.” Whenever\\n', 'I perceive the idea “white,” I just know “clearly and infallibly” “without any pains,\\n', 'labour, or deduction; but at first view” that I really am perceiving the idea “white.”\\n', 'The intuitive knowledge is described as both logically and temporally immediate.\\n', '\\n', 'Notice the similarity in Locke’s description of intuitive knowledge as the result of\\n', 'comparing ideas in this next passage. Again, the mind’s natural power of “distinct\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'perception” is operative in the logical and temporal immediacy of intuitive know-\\n', 'ledge. As long as this mental faculty is working properly, Locke says we will intuit the\\n', 'appropriate agreement “at first glimpse, without hesitation”:\\n', 'Another difference between intuitive and demonstrative Knowledge, is, that though in the latter all doubt be removed, when by the Intervention of the intermediate Ideas, the Agreement or\\n', 'Disagreement is perceived; yet before the Demonstration there was a doubt, which in intuitive\\n', 'Knowledge cannot happen to the Mind that has its Faculty of Perception left to a degree capable of\\n', 'distinct Ideas, no more than it can be a doubt to the Eye, (that can distinctly see White and Black,) whether this Ink, and this Paper be all of a Colour. If there be Sight in the Eyes, it will at first glimpse, without Hesitation, perceive the Words printed on this Paper, different from the Colour\\n', 'of the Paper: And so if the Mind have the Faculty of distinct Perception, it will perceive the\\n', 'Agreement or Disagreement of those Ideas that produce intuitive Knowledge. If the Eyes have lost\\n', 'the Faculty of seeing, or the Mind of perceiving, we in vain inquire after the quickness of Sight in one, or clearness of Perception in the other.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ii.5)\\n', 'I take Locke to be saying that part of the temporal dimension involved in knowing\\n', 'demonstrative agreements is that the comparison of the ideas itself does not instant-\\n', 'aneously result in knowing the agreement as it does in intuitive knowledge. Just as\\n', 'when we see the ink of the printed words juxtaposed with the color of the paper, there\\n', 'is no “hesitation” in perceiving that “the words printed on this paper [are] different\\n', 'from the color of the paper,” when we compare any two ideas minimally necessary to\\n', 'show the agreement, we will equally, without hesitation, “at first view” know that\\n', 'agreement. If nothing else is needed to perceive the agreement, if the idea or ideas are\\n', 'perceived (that is, they appear in the Mind such that the agreement can be perceived),\\n', 'and if the mind’s faculty of perception is functioning properly, then we will with the\\n', 'same “quickness of sight” perceive the agreement. This is no more than to reiterate\\n', 'and provide more textual evidence for Locke’s “one-act” theory of knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'Therefore, we should see intuitive knowledge generally as having both logical and\\n', 'temporal immediacy: It involves neither an intervening idea to show the agreement,\\n', 'nor is the knowledge temporally distinguishable from the mental act involved in\\n', 'perceiving the ideas.\\n', '\\n', 'The description of intuitive knowledge as logically and temporally immediate is\\n', 'also found in Locke’s version of the cogito argument. Consider again this passage, to\\n', 'which I gave considerable focus in part I. He says, “In every Act of Sensation,\\n', 'Reasoning, or Thinking, we are conscious to our selves of our own Being; and, in\\n', 'this Matter, come not short of the highest degree of Certainty” (IV.ix.3). Locke is here\\n', 'stating that we have intuitive knowledge of our own real existence as a component of\\n', 'any perception, thinking, or what is equivalent, having ideas.95 For Locke, there is\\n', '95 Locke considers perceiving, thinking, and having ideas equivalent: “To ask, at what time a Man first has any Ideas, is to ask, when he begins to perceive; having Ideas, and Perception being the same thing”\\n', '(II.i.9). And in II.vi.2, Locke equates the power of thinking with the power of perception. See, again, also II.xiv.3.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'SENSITIVE KNOWLEDGE AND THE SKEPTICAL CHALLENGE\\n', '\\n', 'nothing more than what is involved in a perception of the understanding, which is\\n', 'part and parcel with the knowledge it includes. “For in this [intuitive knowledge], the\\n', 'Mind is at no pains of proving or examining, but perceives the Truth, as the Eye doth\\n', 'light, only by being directed toward it” (IV.ii.1). When I perceive the idea, in that\\n', 'moment, I just know the agreement.\\n', '\\n', 'Locke continues that intuitive knowledge is “irresistible” and “like the bright Sun-\\n', 'shine, forces it self immediately to be perceived, as soon as ever the Mind turns its\\n', 'view that way; and leaves no room for Hesitation, Doubt, or Examination, but the\\n', 'Mind is presently filled with the clear Light of it” (IV.ii.1). Locke seems to be saying\\n', 'that as soon as we are aware of the ideas in our minds we perceive the agreement;\\n', 'intuitive knowledge is “irresistible” to us. It leaves “no room for Doubt or Hesita-\\n', 'tion.” In the moment of perceiving the agreement we cannot but accept what we\\n', 'perceive: the knowledge is unavoidable. So, just as the brightness of the sun is\\n', 'irresistible to our sight, which means that we cannot but perceive the brightness of\\n', 'the sun in the moment we look at the sun, we cannot but perceive and accept as true\\n', 'those particular agreements when we perceive (look at) those ideas—when they are\\n', 'presented to us in consciousness. Intuitively (non-inferentially) perceived agree-\\n', 'ments, therefore, have the second analogous feature. They are “irresistible” and\\n', 'unavoidable; they are in a sense forced on us.96 We are “filled with the clear Light”\\n', 'of the knowledge upon perceiving the ideas.\\n', '\\n', 'Finally, we come to the third analogous feature. Locke tells us that the intuitive\\n', 'knowledge of the identity (and diversity) of our own ideas, which is of the highest\\n', 'certainty, resists a skeptical attitude:\\n', '’Tis on this Intuition, that depends all the certainty and Evidence of our knowledge, which\\n', 'Certainty every one finds to be so great, that he cannot imagine, and therefore not require a\\n', 'greater: For a Man cannot conceive himself capable of a greater Certainty, than to know that\\n', 'any Idea in his Mind is such as he perceives it to be; and that two Ideas, wherein he perceives a\\n', 'difference, are different, and not precisely the same. He that demands a greater Certainty than\\n', 'this, demands he knows not what, and shews only that he has a Mind to be a Sceptick, without\\n', 'being able to be so.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ii.1)\\n', 'The certainty of my intuitive knowledge is derived from the infallibility of the\\n', 'intuition. It makes sense, then, that Locke ends the passage with the claim that\\n', 'I cannot genuinely doubt my intuitive knowledge. I cannot in good faith doubt\\n', 'what is so very clear to me. As Locke puts it, to doubt my intuitive knowledge\\n', 'shows only that I have “a Mind to be a Sceptick, without being able to be so.” I read\\n', 'this point to be that as hard as I might try to adopt a skeptical stance toward my own\\n', 'intuitive knowledge, I cannot rid myself of the certainty I immediately experience\\n', 'whenever I perceive the agreements of those ideas. Furthermore, the certainty of\\n', '96 Locke describes “perception” as by and large a passive operation. “For in bare naked Perception, the Mind is, for the most part, only passive, and what it perceives it cannot avoid perceiving” (II.ix.1).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'intuitive knowledge is reinforced—I have the same certainty—each time I step back to\\n', 'consider whether what I take to be intuitive knowledge really is intuitive knowledge,\\n', 'namely that “a Circle is not a Triangle, that Three are more than Two, and equal to One\\n', 'and Two” (IV.ii.1). At no time does it seem natural to doubt the certainty of my\\n', 'perception of the idea “white”—that it is as I am perceiving it to be—or that when\\n', 'I perceive the idea “white” and the idea “black”, they are different. To take a skeptical\\n', 'stance toward what is so very certain to me, and even reinforced to me with each\\n', 'reflective challenge, as we have it in Locke’s model of the mind, would be to adopt an\\n', 'attitude to my own experience of which I am “incapable.” So, Locke’s lack of concern\\n', 'for skepticism with respect to intuitive knowledge is not evidence that he ignores the\\n', 'problem, but rather reveals his conviction that when it comes to the nature of these\\n', 'kinds of agreements we cannot get ourselves into a perceptual situation in which the\\n', 'skeptical challenge has any purchase on us.97\\n', '3.III.3 The Similarity of Intuitive and Sensitive\\n', 'Knowledge: The Case for Sensitive Knowledge\\n', 'Let us turn now to Locke’s discussion of sensitive knowledge to see additional ways in\\n', 'which it is analogous to intuitive knowledge. To provide more evidence why we\\n', 'should see sensitive knowledge as a form of non-inferential knowledge and to elicit\\n', 'the two cognitive standpoints essential to differentiating the three degrees of\\n', 'certainty of knowledge, we are looking to establish the same three features in sensitive\\n', 'knowledge: (1) it is immediate in both the logical and temporal senses; (2) it is\\n', 'irresistible, or unavoidable; and (3) it resists a skeptical attitude. I will consider the\\n', 'first two in this section. The third, I will treat in section 3.III.4.\\n', '\\n', 'Before considering the analogy proper, it is helpful to have in mind the following\\n', 'two points. First, like intuitive and demonstrative knowledge, sensitive knowledge has a\\n', 'degree of certainty that comes with any instance of knowledge. Locke says, “where-ever\\n', 'the Mind perceives the Agreement or Disagreement of any of its Ideas, there be certain\\n', 'knowledge” (IV.ii.2). The agreement perceived in an instance of sensitive knowledge is\\n', 'the agreement of “real existence” with respect to “particular finite beings without us”\\n', '(IV.xi.3, IV.ii.14). This means that Locke does not understand sensitive knowledge as a\\n', 'form of probable judgment. In probable judgment, “the Mind takes its Ideas to agree,\\n', 'or disagree . . . without perceiving a demonstrative Evidence in the Proofs” (IV.xiv.3).\\n', '\\n', 'Probable judgment is not the perception of an agreement, but taking there to be one\\n', 'when one is not perceived.98 In addition to the textual evidence on this point, note that\\n', '97 We will see that when it comes to sensitive knowledge this claim will be more nuanced with respect to which skeptical question is asked—whether we can have knowledge of things outside of us or whether we can have inferential knowledge of things outside of us.\\n', '\\n', '98 See also IV.xiv.4: “Judgment, which is the putting Ideas together, or separating them from one\\n', 'another in the Mind, when their certain agreement or disagreement is not perceived, but presumed to be so; which is as the Word imports, taken to be so before it certainly appears.”\\n', '\\n', 'SENSITIVE KNOWLEDGE AND THE SKEPTICAL CHALLENGE\\n', '\\n', 'were Locke to consider sensitive knowledge mere probable judgment, there would be\\n', 'no reason for him to assign it a middle degree of certainty falling somewhere between\\n', 'demonstrative knowledge and probability. It would have the degree of certainty of an\\n', 'agreement perceived either intuitively or demonstratively, or a degree of assent due a\\n', 'probable judgment, but not one, as Locke claims, falling somewhere in between. Yet,\\n', 'Locke states clearly not only that sensitive knowledge attains a degree of certainty, but\\n', 'also that “going beyond bare probability, and yet not reaching to either of the foregoing\\n', '[intuitive and demonstrative] degrees of certainty, [it] passes under the name of\\n', 'knowledge” (IV.ii.14). Therefore, Locke’s account of sensitive knowledge should not\\n', 'be seen as reducible to probable judgment.\\n', '\\n', 'I am sensitive to the concern that the IV.ii.14 passage just quoted need not be read as\\n', 'I interpret it. Rather, although called “knowledge” by Locke, perhaps sensitive know-\\n', 'ledge is better seen as a very high degree of probability falling between “bare probabil-\\n', 'ity” and intuitive and demonstrative knowledge. Rickless (2008) argues that not all true\\n', 'propositions are candidates for knowledge. Thus, Locke’s definition of knowledge as\\n', '“the perception of an agreement or disagreement of ideas” is reconcilable with an\\n', 'account in which what Locke calls the certainty of sensitive knowledge amounts to\\n', '“what Locke calls ‘assurance’—founded in the highest possible degree of probability”\\n', '(2008: 85), where “‘assurance’ is used in a very specific, technical sense” (2008: 92).\\n', '\\n', 'I think Rickless argues forcefully that Locke can be read this way. I disagree, however,\\n', 'that the textual evidence Rickless cites is conclusive, for there is other textual evidence\\n', 'that seems to be in conflict with the view that “assurance” or even “greatest” or “full\\n', 'assurance” is a technical term for the highest degree of probability. For example, in\\n', 'IV.ii.6, Locke uses “full assurance” to describe the certainty of intuitive knowledge: “’Tis\\n', 'true, the Perception, produced by Demonstration, is also very clear; yet it is often with a\\n', 'great abatement of that evident lustre and full assurance, that always accompany that\\n', 'which I call intuitive.” In II.xxxii.6, Locke uses “assurance” as the degree of certainty we\\n', 'have that the truth of relations between general ideas holds in all instances: “therefore, to\\n', 'shorten its way to knowledge, and make each perception more comprehensive, the first\\n', 'thing it does, as the foundation of the easier enlarging its knowledge . . . , is to bind them\\n', 'into bundles, and rank them so into sorts, that what knowledge it gets of any of them it\\n', 'may thereby with assurance extend to all of that sort.” And in IV.viii.3 we find\\n', '“assurance” equated with “infallibly know”:\\n', 'Let a man abound, as much as the plenty of words which he has will permit, in such\\n', 'propositions as these: “a law is a law,” and “obligation is obligation”; “right is right,” and\\n', '“wrong is wrong”: will these and the like ever help him to an acquaintance with ethics, or\\n', 'instruct him or others in the knowledge of morality? Those who know not, nor perhaps ever\\n', 'will know, what is right and what is wrong, nor the measures of them, can with as much\\n', 'assurance make, and infallibly know, the truth of these and all such propositions, as he that is\\n', 'best instructed in morality can do. But what advance do such propositions give in the\\n', 'knowledge of anything necessary or useful for their conduct?\\n', '\\n', '(IV.viii.3)\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'Finally, in this next passage, Locke tells us that the “greatest assurance” comes from\\n', 'intuition and demonstration:\\n', 'In propositions, then, whose certainty is built upon the clear perception of the agreement or\\n', 'disagreement of our ideas, attained either by immediate intuition, as in self-evident proposi-\\n', 'tions, or by evident deductions of reason in demonstrations we need not the assistance of\\n', 'revelation, as necessary to gain our assent, and introduce them into our minds. Because the\\n', 'natural ways of knowledge could settle them there, or had done it already; which is the greatest\\n', 'assurance we can possibly have of anything.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.xviii.5)\\n', 'In addition to Locke’s uses of “assurance” to refer to the subjective certainty we have\\n', 'in both intuitive and demonstrative knowledge, he also uses it to denote any degree of\\n', 'assent to a proposition. When talking about the degree to which any “rational\\n', 'Creature” is “a lover of Truth” Locke says,\\n', '[T]here are very few lovers of Truth for Truth’s sake, even amongst those, who perswade\\n', 'themselves that they are so. How a Man may know whether he be so in earnest is worth\\n', 'enquiry: And I think there is one unerring Mark of it, viz. The not entertaining any Proposition\\n', 'with greater assurance than the Proofs it is built upon will warrant.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.19.1)\\n', 'That Locke uses “assurance” to denote any degree of assent to a proposition, indeed,\\n', 'even only a degree of subjective confidence that is less than rational, undercuts the\\n', 'further objection that, in spite of the conflicting texts, Rickless has the best reading of\\n', '“assurance.”99 Therefore, we should see sensitive knowledge as having a degree of\\n', 'certainty that comes with any form of knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'Second, Locke asserts an explicit analogy of intuitive to sensitive knowledge in\\n', 'II.xxiii.15: “For whilst I know, by seeing or hearing, etc. that there is some Corporeal\\n', 'Being without me, the Object of that sensation, I do more certainly know, that there is\\n', 'some Spiritual Being within me, that sees and hears.” Locke clearly seems to be saying\\n', 'that intuitively perceived agreements are quite like sensitively perceived ones. Just as\\n', 'I know that I exist when I am perceiving any idea, I know that there exists a corporeal\\n', 'being when I have an occurrent idea of sensation. Note that in Locke’s own analogy\\n', 'between knowing that “there is some Corporeal Being without me,” a case of sensitive\\n', 'knowledge, and knowing that “there is some Spiritual being within me,” a case of\\n', 'intuitive knowledge, both count as knowledge. Yet, he clarifies, “I do more certainly\\n', 'know” what I know intuitively than what I know sensitively. This lends support to my\\n', 'claim that Locke’s commitments are much better served by first classifying knowledge\\n', 'as either non-inferential or inferential and then applying other conditions to determine\\n', 'the different degrees of certainty. Once I have established that sensitive knowledge, like\\n', 'intuitive knowledge, is logically and temporally immediate, is irresistible, and resists a\\n', 'skeptical attitude, I will provide another argument why sensitive knowledge, although\\n', 'psychologically akin to intuitive knowledge, is not the same as intuitive knowledge: It is,\\n', '99 See also I.i.2. Rockwood (2013: 19–24) offers more arguments against Rickless’s (forthcoming)\\n', 'attempt to defend this and other arguments in Rickless (2008).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'SENSITIVE KNOWLEDGE AND THE SKEPTICAL CHALLENGE\\n', '\\n', 'as Locke claims, less certain than intuitive knowledge. Let us turn now to the analogy\\n', 'between sensitive and intuitive knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter ii of Book IV is entitled Of the Degrees of our Knowledge. In the IV.ii.14\\n', 'analysis of the degree of certainty of sensitive knowledge, Locke states that sensitive\\n', 'knowledge begins with the perception of an idea of an external object. He then\\n', 'considers the skeptical problem. He says that many go on to question whether in fact\\n', 'we should infer that the idea we know intuitively to be in the mind corresponds to an\\n', 'actual object existing outside of us:\\n', 'But whether there be any thing more certain than barely that Idea in our Minds, whether we\\n', 'can thence certainly infer the existence of any thing without us, which corresponds to that Idea,\\n', 'is that, whereof some Men think there may be a question made, because Men may have such\\n', 'Ideas in their Minds, when no such thing exists, no such Object affects their Senses.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ii.14)\\n', 'In this passage, Locke confirms the skeptical concern as traditionally conceived: With\\n', 'just an idea of an external object in our minds “can we thence infer the existence of\\n', 'any thing without us, which corresponds to that Idea” (my emphasis in bold).\\n', '\\n', 'Traditionally, the question concerning sensitive knowledge is whether our particular\\n', 'ideas of sensation give us enough reason to conclude the existence of an external\\n', 'world? Are we normatively entitled to the inference?\\n', '\\n', 'I have already argued that Locke answers this question in the rest of IV.ii.14 when\\n', 'he considers what he calls the “evidence” for sensitive knowledge—what, he says,\\n', '“puts us past doubting.” Being conscious of the idea of an external object as from\\n', 'sensation is a condition on having sensitive knowledge. But the point I am arguing\\n', 'here is slightly different. Here I am arguing that Locke himself is drawing a similarity\\n', 'between the ways in which we intuitively and sensitively perceive agreements. He\\n', 'addresses the skeptical question posed in the preceding passage by saying that when\\n', 'we have ideas of external objects as the result of being affected through the senses, we\\n', 'do indeed have enough evidence in the perception of the idea itself (without needing\\n', 'anything else) to put us past doubting that there really exists something external to us\\n', 'producing our ideas. I repeat here the passage cited earlier in part II:\\n', 'But yet here, I think, we are provided with an Evidence that puts us past doubting: For I ask any\\n', 'one, Whether he be not invincibly conscious to himself of a different Perception, when he\\n', 'looks on the Sun by day, and thinks on it by night; when he actually tastes Wormwood, or\\n', 'smells a Rose, or only thinks on that Savour, or Odour. We as plainly find the difference there\\n', 'is between any Idea revived in our Minds by our own Memory, and actually coming into our\\n', 'Minds by our Senses, as we do between any two distinct Ideas.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ii.14)\\n', 'As a part of perceiving either an occurrent sensory idea or a memory we are\\n', '“invincibly conscious” to ourselves of the source of the idea.100 We can just tell\\n', '100 Although one might want to consider this kind of evidence weak, since it has to do with the quality of ideas, I suggest that Locke does not. One difference he sees between intuitive and demonstrative knowledge is that in intuitive knowledge “all doubt is removed,” while in demonstrative knowledge “before the Demonstration there was a doubt” (IV.ii.5). Locke seems to be saying that once an agreement is\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'that we are sensing rather than, say, remembering. But then he says, we as “plainly\\n', 'find” the difference in our experience “as we do between any two distinct Ideas.” Note\\n', 'that Locke is stating relatively clearly that the immediacy and certainty of our\\n', 'knowledge that the perception of an idea of the sun is due to sensation rather than\\n', 'due to memory is the same as the immediacy and certainty with which we know\\n', 'intuitively that two ideas are distinct. That is, it is just as immediately (in both the\\n', 'logical and temporal senses) certain to me that my perception of the idea of the sun is\\n', 'from sensation when I am looking at the sun, as it is immediately certain to me that\\n', 'any two ideas are different. Locke seems to be arguing that sensitive knowledge, like\\n', 'intuitive knowledge, is both logically and temporally immediate; it is non-inferential.\\n', '\\n', 'Moreover, that sensitive knowledge is both logically and temporally immediate\\n', 'implies that it is at the same time irresistible, or psychologically unavoidable. When\\n', 'we are in the right perceptual situation, that is, when the conditions are right to\\n', 'perceive the agreement (our complex mental state includes the perception of an\\n', 'occurrent real and adequate idea as of an external object, which also includes an\\n', 'awareness of the idea as from sensation), we cannot avoid knowing and accepting\\n', 'it.101 Hence, we have the first and second analogous features: sensitive knowledge is\\n', 'immediate and irresistible.\\n', '\\n', 'Because sensitive knowledge shares the two aforementioned features with intuitive\\n', 'knowledge, I suggest that we interpret Locke’s response to the skeptical concern,\\n', 'namely whether we can infer that there exist objects external to us in the moment we\\n', 'are sensing them, to be that the question is moot. As traditionally conceived, the\\n', 'skeptical question is inappropriate for Locke’s account, because sensitive knowledge\\n', 'does not involve an inference at all: It is both logically and temporally immediate.\\n', '\\n', 'Sensitive knowledge is something we have instantaneously when we perceive ideas\\n', 'as the result of being occurrently affected through the senses. Therefore, we need\\n', 'not make an additional inference from our ideas to an external world. Locke’s\\n', 'perceived in demonstrative knowledge, we are “past doubt.” The same would be the case in sensitive\\n', 'knowledge. The “evidence” is given in the perception of the agreement.\\n', '\\n', '101 Does this mean that my account is in conflict with Locke’s II.ix.8 claim that in visual perception there is a judgment from the immediate simple ideas of sensation, say, an idea of a “flat Circle variously shadow’d” to a complex idea of a round globe? Owen (1999: 33, n 9) notes the same possible objection: “If\\n', '‘judgement’ here [in II.ix.8] were being used in precisely the same way as it is in the later chapters of Book IV, then this would be a case of visual perception being inferential. But the way Locke describes it, it seems more a matter of unconscious processing ‘by an habitual custom’ than conscious reasoning.” Indeed,\\n', 'Owen’s interpretation that the mind’s movement from the perception of a flat circle to a perception of a round globe is due to habit is confirmed by Locke in Of the Conduct of the Understanding. There he (1996/\\n', '1706: 219) warns against the “evil” of associating ideas that “have no natural cohesion.” He continues:\\n', '“This is for caution against this evil, before it be thoroughly riveted by custom in the understanding; but he that would cure it, when habit has established it, must nicely observe the very quick and almost\\n', 'imperceptible motions of the mind in its habitual actions. What I have said in another place about the change of the ideas of sense into those of judgment may be proof of this.” I take this to establish conclusively that Locke’s use of “judgment” in this section (II.ix.8) is not the same as we find in his understanding of judgment in IV.xiv–xv.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'SENSITIVE KNOWLEDGE AND THE SKEPTICAL CHALLENGE\\n', '\\n', 'response to the skeptical concern raised in IV.ii.14, therefore, is that we need not\\n', 'question, as some do, whether on the basis of our sense experiences we are entitled to\\n', 'infer the existence of external objects. The reason is that sensitive knowledge, like\\n', 'intuitive knowledge, is non-inferential. Both kinds of agreements are logically and\\n', 'temporally immediate, and both are psychologically unavoidable; that is, when we\\n', 'perceive the agreeing ideas we just know and are compelled to accept that the\\n', 'agreement obtains.102\\n', 'Given what I have argued, one might think my interpretation commits Locke to\\n', 'the view that a visual hallucination of a pink elephant would count as an instance of\\n', 'sensitive knowledge, for the hallucination would be experienced as having originated\\n', 'in sensation. Unfortunately, Locke’s treatment of the skeptical problem is concerned\\n', 'with only systematic error, such as we have if there is an evil demon or we are locked\\n', 'in a perpetual dream. As is duly discussed by Bolton (2004a, 2004b) and LoLordo\\n', '(2008), Locke does not pay sufficient attention to occasional perceptual error. There\\n', 'are, however, two things to say that alleviate having to saddle Locke with the view\\n', 'that hallucinations count as sensitive knowledge. First, Locke thinks that the collec-\\n', 'tions of ideas we experience as originating in the senses do actually exist together:\\n', 'In fine then, when our senses do actually convey into our Understandings any Idea, we cannot\\n', 'but be satisfied, that there doth something at that time really exist without us, which doth affect our Senses, and by them give notice of it self to our apprehensive Faculties, and actually\\n', 'produce that Idea, which we then perceive: and we cannot so far distrust their Testimony, as to\\n', 'doubt, that such Collections of simple Ideas, as we have observed by our Senses to be united\\n', 'together, do really exist together.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.xi.9)\\n', 'So, it seems that he would not countenance doubting that whatever we are experi-\\n', 'encing through the senses corresponds to something that is or can be experienced\\n', 'through the senses. That is, the collections of simple sensory ideas composing our\\n', 'ideas of external objects are real and adequate ideas.\\n', '\\n', 'Second, one reason why Locke might say this is that he can also be seen to think\\n', 'that just as there is an obvious conscious difference between ideas originating in\\n', 'sensation, memory, and, say, reflective mental states, there is a (perhaps even more\\n', 'fine-grained) difference in experience between regular sensory ideas and occasional\\n', 'hallucinations. For example, after having been slipped a hallucinogenic drug I may\\n', 'see a pink elephant (or Cartman, my black cat—the same one I interact with\\n', 'regularly) at the back of the room. I suggest that, for Locke, even though I am having\\n', 'a “visual” experience (an hallucination) of Cartman, it is not phenomenologically\\n', 'identical to a regular visual experience. Hallucinating is a different kind of mental act\\n', 'and so experienced differently. Locke is also clear that we are aware of all of our\\n', '102 As we will see shortly, having sensitive knowledge does not preclude the possibility that the causes of my sensory ideas are radically different from the way in which I experience them. Remember that this is a reply to the skeptic consistent with a representational theory of perception.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'mental operations, even if we have only “obscure Notions” (II.i.25), and I have\\n', 'argued (as have others) that there are very good reasons to think that this awareness\\n', 'is due to consciousness. Phenomenological theories of consciousness generally attri-\\n', 'bute a particular subjective character, or a certain phenomenal quality of “what it is\\n', 'like” to experience different kinds of perceptual states. So occasional hallucinations\\n', 'can be seen as distinguishable from normal sense experience.103\\n', 'Finally, although considered a systematic skeptical possibility, the analysis of the\\n', '“unknown faculty” in Descartes’s interpretation can be seen as making a similar\\n', 'point. Newman (1994: 496) has argued persuasively that Descartes accepts the view\\n', 'that we are aware of all of our mental activity: “For any faculty, known or unknown,\\n', 'in me, I am aware of when its operations occur.” Therefore, were the ideas originating\\n', 'in such a faculty, I would be conscious of it. Since Locke is also committed to the view\\n', 'that all thinking is conscious (II.i.19), I see no reason why he would argue differently.\\n', '\\n', 'Perhaps the point to underscore is that, for Locke, our experience in sensing, namely\\n', 'the perception of an agreement of ideas and the subjective certainty therein, is\\n', 'sufficient for sensitive knowledge as a form of non-inferential knowledge.104\\n', '3.III.4 The Difference in Degree of Certainty\\n', 'of Sensitive and Intuitive Knowledge\\n', 'Locke is quite clear that although sensitive knowledge is a species of knowledge, and\\n', '(as I have argued) the agreement is perceived non-inferentially, still it is not as certain\\n', 'as intuitive knowledge: “The notice we have by our Senses, of the existing of Things\\n', 'without us, though it be not altogether so certain, as our intuitive Knowledge, or the\\n', 'Deductions of our Reason, employ’d about the clear abstract Ideas of our own Minds;\\n', 'yet it is an assurance that deserves the name of Knowledge” (IV.xi.3). Problematically,\\n', 'the distinction concerning certainty seems unavailable, since on the foregoing\\n', '103 See, for example, Zahavi (2005: 119): “Every conscious state, be it a perception, an emotion, a recollection, or an abstract belief, has a certain subjective character, a certain phenomenal quality of “what it is like” to live through and undergo that state.” I am not claiming anachronistically that this is evidence that Locke held the view. I merely want to point out that such a view is not idiosyncratic.\\n', '\\n', '104 This does bring up the independent question whether Locke can consistently adhere to the mental transparency thesis, even though he obviously accepted it. To return to Locke’s II.ix.8 treatment of the\\n', '“Molyneux problem,” one might think, for example, that we are not conscious of the idea of the “flat Circle, variously Shadow’d” on our way to perceiving the idea of a round globe. I have argued, though, that being conscious of all that passes in the mind (as Locke states it in II.i.19) is not necessarily to have a full-fledged idea of all that passes in the mind. Moreover, about habitual movements of the mind Locke says, “Nor need we wonder, that this is done with so little notice, if we consider, how very quick the actions of the Mind are performed” (II.ix.10). I do not think this sort of psychological data is necessarily inconsistent with Locke’s acceptance that all thinking is conscious, especially when consciousness is interpreted as pre-reflective.\\n', '\\n', 'That is, I can be conscious that I am perceiving even when owing to “habitual custom” the object of my perception passes so quickly in the mind that I do not take full notice of it. Moreover, that the unity of consciousness is maintained in the mind’s movement from the idea of the flat circle to the idea of the round globe supports that we are conscious we are perceiving throughout the change in ideas.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'SENSITIVE KNOWLEDGE AND THE SKEPTICAL CHALLENGE\\n', '\\n', 'analysis sensitive and intuitive knowledge are seen to be equivalent. In both cases,\\n', 'when I perceive the agreement I am immediately and irresistibly certain—with no\\n', 'room for skeptical concern.\\n', '\\n', 'The difference between the degrees of certainty in sensitive and intuitive know-\\n', 'ledge, I suggest, has been masked by the fact that the analysis of knowledge presented\\n', 'thus far has focused on only the psychological conditions of knowledge: the percep-\\n', 'tion of an agreement and the subjective force of the certainty attending any percep-\\n', 'tion of agreement. In terms of meeting these conditions, both kinds of knowledge are\\n', 'the same and both strike us the same—we cannot but accept what we perceive when\\n', 'we perceive the agreement. Nevertheless, insists Locke, sensitive knowledge is less\\n', 'certain. As Locke says, there are “three degrees of Knowledge, viz. Intuitive, Demon-\\n', 'strative, and Sensitive: in each of which there are different degrees and ways of\\n', 'Evidence and Certainty” (IV.ii.14). Perceiving an agreement, for Locke, constitutes\\n', 'knowledge, and all knowledge is certain.105 But how certain the knowledge is—its\\n', 'degree of certainty—depends on additional factors, namely whether a further reflect-\\n', 'ive normative condition is met.106 I suggest that the fact that sensitive knowledge\\n', 'enjoys a degree of certainty does not mean that it is beyond any doubt; neither does\\n', 'its vulnerability to doubt mean that it does not have a degree of certainty. I propose\\n', 'that, for Locke, intuitive and sensitive knowledge have different degrees of certainty,\\n', 'because intuitive knowledge withstands a second-order normative consideration,\\n', 'while sensitive knowledge does not.107 Although our sensitive knowledge is not as\\n', 'certain as we initially thought it was, our intuitive knowledge maintains its\\n', 'certainty—or at least our intuitive knowledge is as certain as we are capable of\\n', 'knowing.\\n', '\\n', 'For example, if after I intuitively perceive that my idea “white” is as I perceive it to\\n', 'be, I were to step back and consider reflectively whether I should accept that\\n', 'conclusion, I would have the same experience of intuitively knowing the idea\\n', '“white” again. The same is true for my intuitive knowledge that “three are more\\n', 'than two” or that “I exist.” I have the same certainty with every consideration\\n', 'whether I should accept what I know in virtue of perceiving the agreement. For\\n', 'every time I reflect on my perception of the agreement, I perceive the agreement\\n', 'again. I cannot place myself in a perceptual situation in which I am not immediately\\n', 'and irresistibly certain that what I perceive is true. Therefore, my intuitive knowledge\\n', 'has what I will call “full epistemic warrant”: it meets the psychological conditions,\\n', '105 See, again, IV.ii.2: “Though where-ever the Mind perceives the Agreement or Disagreement of any of its Ideas, there be certain Knowledge.”\\n', '106 An instance of demonstrative knowledge would also consist in the perception of an agreement and the subjective certainty, therein. As will soon be clear, that it is inferential as opposed to non-inferential does not affect the degree of certainty, except insofar as the knowledge meets a further normative condition.\\n', '\\n', '107 This argument is consistent with a similar one by Ainslie (2003) in his analysis of Hume’s skepticism with regard to reason. As long as belief, or in Locke’s case the certainty of sensitive knowledge, is not something separate from the formation of the belief (or perception of agreement, for Locke), then the skeptic must drive her wedge between the belief and a reflective challenge to it.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'and in reflection I cannot generate a reason why I should not accept it. The\\n', 'perception of my own real existence as well as of identity and diversity or of any\\n', 'other intuitively perceived agreements is of the highest degree of certainty because it\\n', 'withstands a second-order normative challenge.\\n', '\\n', 'Our experience of sensitive knowledge, however, is much different. When we\\n', 'reflect on our sensitive knowledge, our perceptual situation changes. No longer are\\n', 'we perceiving an occurrent idea of sensation, and thus no longer are we perceiving an\\n', 'agreement constituting knowledge with the subjective force of the certainty therein.\\n', '\\n', 'With this shift in cognitive standpoint, there is also a shift in what we are aware of\\n', 'insofar as we perceive an agreement. What we are aware of now is not an idea as\\n', 'currently from sensation, but rather, perhaps, an idea as mental state. Therefore, once\\n', 'we step back from our initial certainty in sensitive knowledge and ask why we should\\n', 'accept what was just so very certain a moment ago, our own experience and\\n', 'observation provide a reason for doubt. After all, when we are not occurrently\\n', 'sensing, we can consider that we might be in a perpetual dream or, equivalently,\\n', 'the victims of an evil demon.108 Sensitive knowledge, therefore, lacks full epistemic\\n', 'warrant and so has a lesser degree of certainty.\\n', '\\n', 'Let me take a moment now to address a couple of questions that might arise. First,\\n', 'I have been asked whether this analysis of sensitive knowledge stands up to Locke’s\\n', 'claims concerning “habitual knowledge,” namely that sensitive knowledge is\\n', 'retained. It does. Habitual knowledge comes in two “degrees”: of such truths where\\n', 'we perceive the relation between ideas again, which is a case of intuitive knowledge,\\n', 'and of such truths where the mind “retains the Memory of the Conviction, without the\\n', 'Proofs” (IV.i.9). Although Locke’s discussion of the latter form of retained knowledge\\n', 'is concerned almost exclusively with demonstrative knowledge, he does at the very\\n', 'end assert, “But yet ’tis evident, the Author himself knows the Proposition to be true,\\n', 'remembering he once saw the connection of those Ideas [in a proof], as certainly as\\n', 'he knows such a Man wounded another, remembering that he saw him run through”\\n', '(IV.i.9). The objection would be that sensitive knowledge as interpreted above would\\n', 'not be retained in memory if it does not withstand a second-order consideration.\\n', '\\n', 'This is not the case, however, since Locke is talking about remembering the certainty\\n', 'with which we perceived the agreement, not perceiving the agreement again. In a case\\n', 'of retained sensitive knowledge, I can remember the certainty with which I initially\\n', 'perceived the agreement, but, nevertheless, I can take a second-order stance to that\\n', '108 My argument is not meant to preclude that we can be considering that we are the victims of an evil demon while we are occurrently sensing. In II.xix.3, Locke states that the mind can be directed towards ideas with various “degrees of Attention.” The mind can be so focused on some ideas “that it shuts out all other Thoughts, and takes no notice of the ordinary Impressions made on the Senses, which at another Season would produce very sensible Perceptions.” To ask how we are able to be occurrently sensing while we are entertaining the possibility of systematic deception is to ask Locke to provide details of how, more generally, ideas are bound together in the mind. But as was mentioned earlier, this is a problem neither peculiar to Locke, nor to sensitive knowledge, nor even to early modern theories of perception. See also Nagel (forthcoming).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'SENSITIVE KNOWLEDGE AND THE SKEPTICAL CHALLENGE\\n', '\\n', 'remembered sensitive knowledge to consider whether there is any room for doubt.\\n', '\\n', 'Then I would have to admit that it is possible that I am in a perpetual dream or\\n', 'deceived by an evil demon. As we have seen, that just is the difference in degree of\\n', 'certainty between sensitive knowledge and intuitive knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'Second, does my account put sensitive knowledge on a par with enthusiasm, since\\n', 'they meet the same psychological conditions of logical and temporal immediacy and\\n', 'the conviction of certainty? To see why they are not on par, think about intuitive\\n', 'knowledge, which is also logically and temporally immediate. Consider, for example,\\n', 'the intuitively known proposition “three is more than two.” It is one question\\n', 'whether that agreement has the highest degree of certainty. I have argued that if in\\n', 'reflection we cannot generate a doubt, then it does. It is an altogether different\\n', 'question whether God has directly revealed that truth to me or I have come to\\n', 'know it by way of Locke’s empiricist explanation (IV.xix.10). Locke says that the\\n', 'certainty of anything known by revelation is the degree of certainty we have that it\\n', 'actually is revelation, not the degree of certainty the perception of the agreement has\\n', 'on its own. Indeed, Locke is clear that “Faith can never convince us of any Thing, that\\n', 'contradicts our Knowledge” (IV.xviii.5). That is because our justification for faith is\\n', 'limited by our ability to have knowledge. So, to think that faith can outstrip\\n', 'knowledge is to “overturn all the Principles and Foundations of Knowledge [God]\\n', 'has given us; render all our Faculties useless; wholly destroy the most excellent Part of\\n', 'his Workmanship, our Understandings” (IV.xviii.5). Thus, if we can know some-\\n', 'thing by our own faculties, it does little to the glorification of God to claim that we\\n', 'know it by direct revelation and not by the use of those faculties. What, then, he asks,\\n', 'would be the point of giving us the faculties in the first place?\\n', '\\n', 'I suggest that a similar answer can be given with respect to why sensitive know-\\n', 'ledge is not equivalent to enthusiasm. The first thing to say is that the psychological\\n', 'conditions are not the same, for perceiving the agreement in an instance of sensitive\\n', 'knowledge includes the experience of the knowledge as having its source in sensation.\\n', '\\n', 'That is, even on the off chance that the source is an evil demon, I still have the\\n', 'experience of being affected through the senses. But again, if what I know by\\n', 'sensation can just as equally be claimed to be an instance of direct revelation, then\\n', 'why has God given us the faculty of sensation? I suggest that Locke is not so\\n', 'concerned with the objection, since he does not think knowledge, in any form, is\\n', 'over determined in this way. “It is hard,” he says, “to conceive how there can be a\\n', 'revelation to any one of what he knows already” (IV.xix.10). Furthermore, Locke’s\\n', 'main objection to enthusiasm is that it is the irrational acceptance of a belief. It is to\\n', 'place faith above reason: “He that believes, without having any Reason for believing,\\n', 'may be in love with his own Fancies; but neither seeks the Truth as he ought, nor pays\\n', 'the Obedience due his Maker, who would have him use those discerning Faculties he\\n', 'has given him, to keep him out of Mistake and Errour. . . . He that does otherwise,\\n', 'transgresses against his own Light, and misuses those Faculties, which were given\\n', 'him to no other end, but to search and follow the clearer Evidence, and greater\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'Probability” (IV.xvii.24). Sensitive knowledge is not the same as enthusiasm, since\\n', 'our experience that we are sensing does indeed give us a reason (even in reflection) to\\n', 'think that our ideas are the result of really existing things affecting our senses, albeit\\n', 'not a reason that withstands all doubt. Indeed, in describing what is meant by\\n', '“enthusiasm,” Locke says, “For strong conceit, like a new principle, carries all easily\\n', 'with it, when got above common sense, and freed from all restraint of reason and\\n', 'check of reflection, it is heightened into a divine authority, in concurrence with our\\n', 'own temper and inclination” (IV.xix.7). Thus, my interpretation has not put sensitive\\n', 'knowledge on par with enthusiasm.\\n', '\\n', 'Returning now to the role of psychological and normative conditions in establish-\\n', 'ing epistemic warrant and so degrees of certainty of knowledge, we can look again to\\n', 'Locke’s aim in the Essay. That task is to discover the limits of human understanding,\\n', 'that is, to show what we are justified in asserting, given the resources we have. Thus, he\\n', 'sees only intuitive knowledge as meeting the highest standard for certainty. Perhaps\\n', 'one reason Locke does not require a more rigid standard for knowledge is that he is\\n', 'not willing to seek justification for any source of knowledge—including the senses—\\n', 'outside of what human understanding can deliver on its own. In his introduction to\\n', 'the nature of the investigation undertaken in the Essay, Locke contrasts his conclu-\\n', 'sions with those of the skeptic:\\n', 'Thus Men, extending their Enquiries beyond their Capacities, and letting their Thoughts\\n', 'wander into those depths, where they can find no sure Footing; ’tis no Wonder, that they\\n', 'raise Questions, and multiply Disputes, which never coming into any clear Resolution, are\\n', 'proper only to continue and increase their Doubts, and to confirm them at last in perfect\\n', 'Scepticism. Whereas were the Capacities of our Understandings well considered, the Extent of\\n', 'our Knowledge once discovered, and the Horizon found, which sets the Bounds between the\\n', 'enlightened and dark Parts of Things; between what is and what is not comprehensible by us,\\n', 'Men would perhaps with less scruple acquiesce in the avow’d ignorance of the one, and imploy\\n', 'their Thoughts and Discourse, with more Advantage and Satisfaction in the other.\\n', '\\n', '(I.i.7)\\n', 'If we have reached the limits of justification, then it makes better sense to say that we\\n', 'have knowledge with at least some degree of certainty, rather than no knowledge at\\n', 'all, especially if Locke’s main task was to ground moral and pragmatic concerns\\n', 'rather than to pursue a “Universal, or perfect Comprehension of whatsoever is.”\\n', 'But if Locke is willing to rest with what our perceptual faculties can deliver of the\\n', 'external world on their own, and even call it knowledge, then why include a slew of\\n', 'probabilistic arguments in defense of it? I suggest that as long as we do not\\n', 'reflectively challenge the psychological experience of certainty in having sensitive\\n', 'knowledge, the probabilistic arguments do not come into play. Once, however, we\\n', 'trade psychological certainty in sensitive knowledge for a new standard by asking the\\n', 'traditional skeptical question “whether we can thence certainly infer the existence\\n', 'of anything without us” (IV.ii.14, my emphasis), we find ourselves in need of\\n', 'additional reasons to shore up the initial deliverances of our perceptual faculty. We\\n', '\\n', 'SENSITIVE KNOWLEDGE AND THE SKEPTICAL CHALLENGE\\n', '\\n', 'are asking whether our knowledge meets a further normative condition. Hence, we\\n', 'need additional justification.\\n', '\\n', 'We see Locke making this shift from the initial certainty of sensitive knowledge to\\n', 'the need for further warrant when he introduces the probabilistic arguments in\\n', 'IV.xi.3. He begins by affirming that we cannot doubt what is present to our senses:\\n', '“I think no body can, in earnest, be so skeptical, as to be uncertain of the Existence of\\n', 'those Things which he sees and feels” (IV.xi.3). This is a clear statement that sensitive\\n', 'knowledge enjoys certainty and that our sensitive knowledge can be no more certain\\n', 'to us when we are perceiving occurrent real and adequate ideas of sensation.\\n', '\\n', 'Nevertheless, Locke follows by offering additional justification should we reflect or\\n', 'evaluate the certainty of our sensitive knowledge: “besides the assurance we have\\n', 'from our Senses themselves, that they do not err in the Information they give us, of\\n', 'the Existence of Things without us, when they are affected by them, we are farther\\n', 'confirmed in this assurance, by other concurrent Reasons” (IV.xi.3). For example,\\n', 'those arguments include pointing to our ability to be affected by the senses (IV.xi.4),\\n', 'the passivity of the senses (IV.xi.5), the fact that a sense experience is often accom-\\n', 'panied by a pain, while a memory of the very same experience is not (IV.xi.6), and the\\n', 'fact that we have common agreement concerning our sense experiences (IV.xi.7).\\n', '\\n', 'Each of these probabilistic arguments is an attempt after the fact to meet the skeptical\\n', 'doubt. Each argument attempts to answer the question whether we ought to accept\\n', 'what we cannot but admit while we are perceiving ideas as the result of being\\n', 'occurrently affected through the senses.\\n', '\\n', 'The probabilistic arguments employed by Locke, therefore, are not addressed to\\n', 'the perception of the agreement of real existence (with respect to particular finite\\n', 'beings) and the certainty I experience in the moment of sensing, but to a second-\\n', 'order reflective challenge to the sufficiency of those conditions for the highest form of\\n', 'knowledge. Thus, it makes sense to interpret Locke as seeing the difference between\\n', 'the degrees of certainty of knowledge as the difference in the ability to withstand a\\n', 'challenge of this kind. My suggestion, therefore, is that these arguments address\\n', 'different tasks: grounding sensitive knowledge in psychological conditions due to the\\n', 'nature and experience of our own thinking and seeking to ground it in a second-\\n', 'order normative perspective we take to our own thinking and experience. The\\n', 'difference between intuitive and sensitive knowledge is not, in other words, that\\n', 'one is knowledge and the other really is not; it is that intuitive knowledge meets\\n', 'second-order normative as well as psychological conditions for certainty while\\n', 'sensitive knowledge meets only the psychological conditions. [Remember that neces-\\n', 'sary and sufficient for knowledge (in general) is the perception of an agreement or\\n', 'disagreement of ideas (with the subjective force of certainty attending any perception\\n', 'of agreement).] The additional epistemic condition of withstanding a reflective\\n', 'challenge determines the degree of certainty from a second-order normative per-\\n', 'spective and so the differences in the degrees of certainty of knowledge. Locke’s\\n', 'theory of the degrees of certainty of knowledge requires that different epistemic\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'conditions be met for each degree. And if we are confined to only what our\\n', 'perceptual faculties can deliver, then there is nothing wrong with appealing to\\n', 'probabilistic reasons to try to fend off the Cartesian skeptical worry. We can see\\n', 'Locke’s division of knowledge into three degrees of certainty as reflecting that worry,\\n', 'namely the demand for further normative justification for what we know and that\\n', 'any reasons available from a higher-order point of view should be taken into account.\\n', '\\n', 'Therefore, it makes sense to employ other reasons, including probabilistic argu-\\n', 'ments, to buttress sensitive knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'A question might arise whether the force of the probabilistic arguments is so\\n', 'weakened that they serve no real purpose in Locke’s theory, which would be a reason\\n', 'to favor interpretations that see sensitive knowledge as a form of judgment. I suggest\\n', 'that although they are now in the service of buttressing knowledge, the probabilistic\\n', 'arguments have the same relevance as they have in other interpretations. The reason\\n', 'is that they answer the same question, namely the second-order question whether on\\n', 'the basis of our ideas of sensation we should infer that there exist external things.\\n', '\\n', 'From that cognitive standpoint, when we ask that question, the probabilistic argu-\\n', 'ments are indeed important to consider.\\n', '\\n', 'This brings us back to the question why Locke seems so cavalierly unconcerned\\n', 'with the skeptical problem as traditionally put forward. Here we find the third\\n', 'analogous feature. To repeat the IV.xi.3 passage cited above, Locke clearly states\\n', 'his view that no one can “in earnest, be so skeptical, as to be uncertain of the\\n', 'Existence of those Things which he sees and feels.” Notice Locke’s claim that we\\n', 'cannot “in earnest” take a skeptical attitude to sensitive knowledge. Locke speaks of\\n', 'the same (although even greater) difficulty in assuming a skeptical attitude to\\n', 'intuitive knowledge in IV.ii.1. There Locke states that to demand a greater certainty\\n', 'than what we experience in intuitive knowledge “shews only that he has a Mind to be\\n', 'a Sceptick, without being able to be so” (my emphasis). To take the skeptic’s point of\\n', 'view with respect to intuitive knowledge is practically impossible. It seems that we are\\n', 'never able to get ourselves into a perceptual situation in which we can in good faith\\n', 'generate a reason not to accept what we know.\\n', '\\n', 'Although we can generate a reason to doubt our sensitive knowledge, and thus a\\n', 'skeptical attitude is possible, it cannot be held “in earnest,” for the force of the doubt\\n', 'cannot be maintained. I can step back to question reflectively whether I should accept\\n', 'what is psychologically unavoidable, in which case I might realize that all could be a\\n', 'dream. But as soon as I turn my attention back to the things affecting my senses—to\\n', 'my occurrent experiences, I will once again be in a cognitive situation psychologically\\n', 'indistinguishable from an instance of intuitive knowledge. Each time we regain the\\n', 'cognitive situation in which we have sensitive knowledge, we perceive the agreement\\n', 'and thus re-experience the psychological force of the certainty therein.109 Just as my\\n', '109 It is important to emphasize that in “turning my attention back to the things affecting my senses”\\n', 'I will have a new (occurrent) sense experience. Locke is clear that were I to return to a previous instance of\\n', '\\n', 'SENSITIVE KNOWLEDGE AND THE SKEPTICAL CHALLENGE\\n', '\\n', 'continued experience of the certainty of my intuitive knowledge makes me “incap-\\n', 'able” of a skeptical attitude, my continued experience of the certainty of my sensitive\\n', 'knowledge—albeit with intermittent breaks for reflective skeptical doubt—renders\\n', 'me “incapable” of a skeptical attitude. Skepticism can be neither maintained in\\n', 'experience nor solved from within the limits of our own understanding.110 This is,\\n', 'I suggest, Locke’s reply to the skeptic as well as the reason why he seems not to treat\\n', 'the skeptical challenge as seriously as some might think he should.\\n', '\\n', 'One might still object that Locke cannot allow psychological conditions to play\\n', 'such a dominant role in his theory of knowledge, for then we cannot account for the\\n', 'distinction Locke wants to draw between intuitive and demonstrative knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'Although each step in a demonstrative proof reduces to an intuitively perceived\\n', 'agreement, Locke is clear that demonstrative knowledge is still less certain—\\n', 'normatively less certain. The account I have provided, however, is fully consistent\\n', 'with Locke’s understanding of demonstrative knowledge. Consider this passage:\\n', 'By which it is plain, that every step in Reasoning, that produces Knowledge, has intuitive\\n', 'Certainty; which when the Mind perceives, there is no more required, but to remember it to\\n', 'make the Agreement or Disagreement of the Ideas, concerning which we enquire, visible and\\n', 'certain. So that to make any thing a Demonstration, it is necessary to perceive the Agreement of\\n', 'the intervening Ideas, whereby the Agreement or Disagreement of the two Ideas under\\n', 'Examination (whereof the one is always the first, and the other the last in the Account) is\\n', 'found. This intuitive Perception of the Agreement or Disagreement of the intermediate Ideas,\\n', 'in each Step and Progression of the Demonstration, must also be carried exactly in the Mind,\\n', 'and a Man must be sure that no part is left out; which because in long Deductions, and the use\\n', 'of many Proofs, the Memory does not always so readily and exactly retain: therefore it comes\\n', 'to pass, that this is more imperfect than intuitive Knowledge, and Men often embrace\\n', 'Falshoods for Demonstrations.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ii.7)\\n', 'The perception of the agreement between the original ideas in a case of demonstrative\\n', 'knowledge is psychologically unavoidable just as it is in intuitive and sensitive\\n', 'knowledge. Once all the intuitively known steps are laid out, the agreement is “visible\\n', 'and certain.” The reason demonstrative knowledge is less certain is that when I step\\n', 'back in reflection, I can generate a reason why I might not actually have perceived the\\n', 'agreement.

See also IV.xi.11.\\n', '\\n', '110 I suppose that the more one maintains the reflective attitude, as do, say, philosophers, the more one is able to maintain the doubt and the more important is the normative justification.

When we successfully complete a\\n', 'proof—have demonstrative knowledge—we have that “evident lustre and full assur-\\n', 'ance,” namely the clear and distinct perception of an agreement of ideas and the\\n', 'subjective force of the certainty attending it.

As time goes by, I remember fewer\\n', 'and fewer steps in the proof, until I am left with a very “dim” reconstruction of it.\\n', '\\n', 'Although Locke does not specifically say what he means by the clarity and distinct-\\n', 'ness with which we perceive a demonstration, the above interpretation of the passage\\n', 'is in keeping with his definitions of the clarity and distinctness of ideas. “Clarity” is\\n', 'the opposite of “obscurity,” which in simple ideas has several causes: “either dull\\n', 'Organs; or very slight and transient Impressions made by the Objects; or else a\\n', 'weakness in the Memory, not able to retain them as received” (II.xxix.3). An idea is\\n', '“distinct,” for Locke, when it is “sufficiently distinguishable from another” (II.xxix.5).\\n', '\\n', 'A complex idea, which is most suitable for our purposes, is “confused” (the opposite of\\n', 'distinct) when “it is made up of too small a number of simple Ideas, whereby the\\n', 'differences, that make it deserve a different Name, are left out” (II.xxix.7).

Furthermore, it is consistent with Locke’s account of retained (or\\n', '“habitual”) demonstrative knowledge, for that does not require that we are able to\\n', 'reconstruct the proof. Rather, we need only remember the certainty with which we once\\n', 'perceived the agreement and that there is an “immutability of the same relations\\n', 'between the same immutable things” (IV.i.9). In sum, then, the passage above from\\n', 'IV.ii.6 presents no problem for my interpretation.\\n', '\\n', 'If I can be permitted a brief digression, Descartes too, in the Rules for the Direction\\n', 'of the Mind, considered demonstrative knowledge as more vulnerable to mistake\\n', 'because of its reliance on memory. In “Rule Eleven,” Descartes distinguishes between\\n', 'a deduction that “involves a kind of movement of our mind” and one that “no longer\\n', 'signifies a movement but rather the completion of a movement”:\\n', 'That is why we are supposing that deduction is made through intuition when it is simple and\\n', 'transparent, but not when it is complex and involved. When the latter is the case, we call it\\n', '“enumeration” or “induction”, since the intellect cannot simultaneously grasp it as a whole,\\n', 'and its certainty in a sense depends on memory, which must retain the judgments we have\\n', 'made on the individual parts of the enumeration if we are to derive a single conclusion from\\n', 'them taken as a whole.\\n', '\\n', '(CSM I: 37; AT X: 408)\\n', 'Descartes adds only a few lines later:\\n', 'As we have said, conclusions which embrace more than we can grasp in a single intuition\\n', 'depend for their certainty on memory, and since memory is weak and unstable, it must be\\n', 'refreshed and strengthened through this continued and repeated movement of thought.

Similarly, according to Locke, in long and\\n', 'complex proofs there is always the chance that I have forgotten a step, and so even if\\n', 'the original ideas actually agree, I have not perceived them to agree.

I realize on\\n', 'reflection that I am incapable of knowing whether my psychological experience is the\\n', 'result of external objects or whether it is actually the result of an evil demon or of\\n', 'electrodes attached to my brain. Therefore, the doubt I experience when I reflect upon\\n', 'my sensitive knowledge can never be inferentially satisfied. But this does not mean that\\n', 'Locke has not secured any knowledge gained through the senses. Indeed, were all our\\n', 'knowledge of external objects secured by inference, we would not be able to isolate the\\n', 'reflective doubt of the epistemologist from the impossibility of that doubt when having\\n', 'the psychological experience of being presently affected through the senses.\\n', '\\n', 'There is some demonstrative knowledge, however, for which I cannot generate a\\n', 'doubt, because the proofs are simple and the intervening ideas are never forgotten.

Because some demonstrative knowledge (but of course not all) resists\\n', 'reflective doubt, I do not reach a point at which I can raise a wholesale doubt as to the\\n', 'normative status of my cognitive position.

And it is in the experience of our own minds that we come up\\n', 'against the dissonance between what we believe with the utmost confidence and what\\n', 'upon a second-order consideration actually warrants that confidence. In the last\\n', 'chapter on knowledge, before turning to judgment and probability, Locke makes the\\n', 'following observations. First,\\n', 'Our Knowledge, as in other Things, so in this, has a great Conformity with our Sight, that it is\\n', 'neither wholly necessary, nor wholly voluntary. . . . Men that have Senses, cannot chuse but\\n', 'receive some Ideas by them; and if they have Memory, they cannot but retain some of them;\\n', 'and if they have any distinguishing Faculty, cannot but perceive the Agreement, or Disagree-\\n', 'ment of some of them one with another.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.xiii.1)\\n', 'And second,\\n', 'There is also another thing in a Man’s Power, and that is, though he turns his Eyes sometimes\\n', 'towards an Object, yet he may chuse whether he will curiously survey it, and with an intent\\n', 'application, endeavor to observe accurately all that is visible in it.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.xiii.2)\\n', 'I take Locke’s point to be that we cannot but have some knowledge due to the nature\\n', 'of our mental faculties. We cannot avoid the certainty that comes with perceiving\\n', 'agreements of ideas. But we are not limited to what the mind presents to us as\\n', 'psychologically unavoidable. Rather, we have the ability to step back and willfully\\n', 'take a survey of what we perceive in order “to observe accurately all that is visible in\\n', 'it.” Here Locke is acknowledging both the unavoidability of our knowledge and what\\n', 'more is revealed about our knowledge when we consider it from a higher order\\n', 'perspective.\\n', '\\n', '3.III.5 Conclusion\\n', 'This concludes my discussion of Locke’s theory of knowledge and the role consciousness\\n', 'plays in it. I have focused on how we have knowledge of our own ideas, knowledge of\\n', 'ourselves, and knowledge of things external to us, because along with Locke I see these\\n', 'forms of knowledge as “peculiar” or, at least, not as clearly cases of the perception of an\\n', 'agreement of ideas—even though they are. They are cases of knowing particular truths\\n', 'that do not fit squarely under the definition of knowledge as a agreement of ideas in the\\n', 'sense in which we normally think of such agreements as employing general or abstract\\n', 'ideas, and leading to general knowledge. Moreover, although all perceptions of ideas are\\n', 'complex mental states with constituent elements (an idea perceived, an idea of existence,\\n', 'and consciousness), the agreements in these three forms of knowledge depend on just\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'these three constituents and what is implied in having them as a part of the perception of\\n', 'an idea. Realizing the complexity internal to perceptions of ideas allows us not only to\\n', 'make sense of, but also provide a coherent and structurally similar account of, all that\\n', 'Locke says about our intuitive knowledge of our own ideas and ourselves as well as about\\n', 'sensitive knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'It is now time to move on to the role of consciousness in Locke’s theory of personal\\n', 'identity. Here, too, we will see how consciousness as internal to a complex perceptual\\n', 'state allows Locke to establish a revolutionary theory of the diachronic identity of\\n', 'persons that is also sufficient for his moral and theological concerns. Furthermore,\\n', 'my interpretation can accommodate Locke’s commitments to the possibility of false\\n', 'memory and his apparent switching back and forth from a purely psychological\\n', 'account of consciousness as a state of awareness of ourselves to an account that seems\\n', 'also to include a metaphysical aspect to consciousness—as an ongoing self we are\\n', 'aware of in that mental state. What is more, the account avoids problems of\\n', 'circularity and transitivity at no cost.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '4\\n', 'Consciousness in Locke’s Theory\\n', 'of Personal Identity\\n', 'We see some very preliminary considerations of the role of consciousness in\\n', 'questions concerning personal identity in the first chapter of Book II of the Essay.\\n', '\\n', 'No doubt, here, Locke is responding to the Cartesian claim that the essence of the\\n', 'soul is to think, and so the soul must be always thinking: “I know it an Opinion,”\\n', 'Locke says, “that the Soul always thinks, and that it has the actual Perception of Ideas\\n', 'in it self constantly, as long as it exists; and that actual thinking is as inseparable from\\n', 'the Soul, as actual Extension is from the Body” (II.i.9). But then Locke, employing his\\n', 'method of taking an introspective look at our own thinking, counters the Cartesian\\n', 'view by admitting that there is nothing in our experience to back up this claim, and\\n', 'indeed dreamless sleep seems to justify the opposite.1 A better view perhaps, and\\n', 'more warranted by what we actually experience, according to Locke, is that thinking\\n', 'is not the essence of the soul but a power or activity of the soul.2 Even Locke’s\\n', 'concern with memory in these initial passages is in the service of establishing the\\n', 'plausibility (and the better hypothesis) that the soul has periods in which it does not\\n', 'think. Against the view that we might be always thinking and yet not remember it,\\n', 'Locke argues that that would be a very useless sort of thinking indeed. And it is highly\\n', 'implausible to imagine that memory regularly fails for all those hours in the night\\n', 'during which we are sleeping.3 In these arguments, we can see Locke as employing\\n', '1 Locke states, “But he, that would not deceive himself, ought to build his Hypothesis on matter of fact, and make it out by sensible experience, and not presume on matter of fact, because of his Hypothesis, that is, because he supposes it to be so; which way of proving amounts to this, That I must necessarily think all last night, because another supposes I always think, though I my self cannot perceive, that I always do so”\\n', '(II.i.10).\\n', '\\n', '2 “I confess my self, to have one of those dull Souls, that doth not perceive it self always to contemplate ideas, nor can conceive it any more necessary, for the Soul always to think, than for the Body always to move; the perception of Ideas being (as I conceive) to the Soul, what Motion is to the Body, not its Essence, but one of its Operations” (II.i.9).\\n', '\\n', '3 See II.i.15: “To think often, and never to retain it so much as one moment, is a very useless sort of thinking,” and also this passage, “Nature never makes excellent things, for mean or no uses: and it is hardly to be conceived, that our infinitely wise Creator, should make so admirable a Faculty, as the power of Thinking, that faculty which comes nearest the Excellency of his own incomprehensible Being, to be so idlely and uselessly employ’d at least ¼ part of its time here, as to think constantly, without remembering any of those Thoughts, without doing any good to it self or others, or being any way useful to any other part of Creation” (II.i.15).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' CONSCIOUSNESS IN LOCKE’S THEORY OF PERSONAL IDENTITY\\n', 'their shared acceptance of the “mental transparency thesis,” that all thinking is\\n', 'conscious, in order to combat one of Descartes’s most famous doctrines: his com-\\n', 'mitment to the essence of the soul as thinking and the emphasis on the nature of an\\n', 'immaterial substance as the necessary ground for our experience of ourselves as\\n', 'having continued psychological activity.\\n', '\\n', 'We see this in how Locke extends his analysis. In addition, he argues, maintaining\\n', 'that the soul always thinks, in combination with the facts of experience, leads to a\\n', 'number of implausible consequences. And here we start to see the beginning of Locke’s\\n', 'understanding of the role of consciousness in his thoughts on personal identity. For\\n', 'example, if the soul were always thinking, and I am conscious of all of my thinking, then\\n', 'my soul must be going elsewhere when I am sleeping. It is even possible that I share a\\n', 'soul with someone else: it inhabits my body when I am awake and so I am conscious of\\n', 'my thinking, but when I fall asleep, my soul must move on to continue thinking in\\n', 'another body. But then the crucial question is what constitutes the I, self, or person that is\\n', 'me when my soul (and its thinking) inhabits another body. Locke asks “Whether Castor\\n', 'and Pollux, thus, with only one Soul between them, which thinks and perceives in one,\\n', 'what the other is never conscious of, nor is concerned for, are not two distinct Persons,\\n', 'as Castor and Hercules; or as Socrates and Plato were?” (II.i.12). Notice here Locke’s\\n', 'dialectical move from Descartes’s (or anyone’s) reliance on the soul and its continued\\n', 'thinking to an appeal to consciousness for help in distinguishing different persons.\\n', '\\n', 'Even more interestingly, Locke emphasizes not just an awareness of any of our\\n', 'thoughts as ours, but more specifically the consciousness of pleasure and pain and its\\n', 'link to a concern for happiness as crucial to identifying a person: “For if we take\\n', 'wholly away all Consciousness of our Actions and Sensations especially of Pleasure\\n', 'and Pain, and the concernment that accompanies it, it will be hard to know wherein\\n', 'to place personal Identity” (II.i.11). Locke seems to be concluding that our awareness\\n', 'of our own pleasure and pain, which engenders a concern for ourselves insofar as we\\n', 'have experiences of that kind, is tied to consciousness and plays a role in personal\\n', 'identity. I think we can see Locke’s initial concerns with personal identity as not only\\n', 'pointing to the fallout of holding the view that thinking is the essence of the soul, but\\n', 'also considering what would constitute the diachronic identity of a person if not the\\n', 'continued existence of a soul.\\n', '\\n', 'Not until Locke added the II.xxvii chapter On Identity and Diversity to the second\\n', 'edition of the Essay, after the urging of William Molyneux, do we see a full account of\\n', 'issues of individuation and diachronic identity of different kinds of things, including\\n', 'persons, and the role of consciousness in establishing the latter.4 What was previously\\n', '(in the first edition) only a very cursory mention of consciousness and its link to\\n', 'personal identity is now (in the second edition) turned into a full-blown theory of\\n', 'personal identity in which consciousness, rather than substance (either corporeal or\\n', 'thinking), constitutes the criterion for the identity of persons. Indeed, Locke’s theory\\n', '4 Stuart (2013: 298).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CONSCIOUSNESS IN LOCKE’S THEORY OF PERSONAL IDENTITY\\n', '\\n', 'of personal identity, as we find it in II.xxvii of the second edition of the Essay, was\\n', 'philosophically groundbreaking for its attempt to establish a non-substantial identity\\n', 'condition, namely consciousness.5 Locke states, “For the same consciousness being\\n', 'preserv’d, whether in the same or different Substances, the personal Identity is\\n', 'preserv’d” (II.xxvii.13). There are two good reasons why Locke would want a theory\\n', 'of this kind, aside from the fact that the continuity of a thinking (or material)\\n', 'substance is empirically suspect. First, relying on a psychological rather than a\\n', 'substantial condition allows Locke to remain agnostic on the nature of thinking\\n', 'substance: whether or not it must be immaterial. Indeed, having a non-substantial\\n', 'identity condition is consistent with Locke’s claims to know very little at all about the\\n', 'nature of substance. Second, at least by Locke’s lights, the theory is compatible with his\\n', 'theological concerns. A psychological condition allows for some flexibility with regard\\n', 'to the theoretical particularities involved in Locke’s theological commitments to the\\n', 'immortality of the soul and the resurrection of the body.6 Moreover, both of these\\n', 'reasons are consistent with Locke’s overall task in the Essay of outlining the limits of\\n', 'human understanding. What is more, we can see an emphasis on a psychological\\n', 'condition as better in tune with his anti-essentialism and his moral theory, including\\n', 'his view that having certain psychological abilities (including intellectual abilities) is\\n', 'necessary to moral agency, rather than being a particular kind of substance.\\n', '\\n', 'But what exactly did Locke mean when he said that personal identity is preserved\\n', 'when the same consciousness is preserved? What does he mean by having “the same\\n', 'consciousness” (II.xxvii.13)? Let us take a look at some of the interpretive history.\\n', '\\n', 'Many have interpreted Locke to think that consciousness identifies a self both\\n', 'synchronically and diachronically by attributing thoughts and actions to a self.7 So,\\n', 'as far as we are conscious of our past thoughts and actions, we are the same person.8\\n', '5 See Thiel (1998) for a comprehensive discussion of his precursors and the revolutionary nature of Locke’s theory.\\n', '\\n', '6 Ayers (1991: II, 205) and Thiel (1998: 870–1) discuss these issues. See also McCann (1987: 68), who cites as another reason Locke’s desire to provide a theory that is compatible with Christian doctrine but does not also appeal to substantial forms. He says “If Locke can account for the identity of persons without calling upon any immaterial principles of unity—souls, substantial forms—then he will have snatched the best case away from the Scholastics.” I will have more to say about Locke’s theological commitments as we move on.\\n', '\\n', '7 I will follow the bulk of Locke scholarship by treating ‘self ’ and ‘person’ as synonymous. Note, however, that Locke does draw the following distinction: “Person, as I take it, is the name for this self. Wherever a Man finds, what he calls himself, there I think another may say is the same Person” (II.xxvii.26). I interpret the difference to be that ‘self ’ denotes that which we perceive from the subjective (first-personal) point of view, where as ‘person’ denotes the same thing as referred to from the objective (third personal) point of view.\\n', '\\n', 'What is being denoted in each case is the identity condition for persons. As will become clear, I am not arguing that Locke considered persons to be exhausted by their consciousness. For alternative views, see Thiel (1998: 891), who interprets ‘self ’ to refer either to the person or to the human being, and Yolton (2004: 23–4) for the view that ‘person’ designates a ‘moral self,’ while ‘self ’ designates a ‘secular self.’\\n', '8 Those attributing to Locke the view that the central issue concerns the subjective constitution of the self by means of consciousness of past and present thoughts and actions include Mackie (1976: 183), Behan (1979), Edwin Curley (1982: 310), Winkler (1998: 153f), Thiel (2011: 210), and LoLordo (2012: 70–4).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' CONSCIOUSNESS IN LOCKE’S THEORY OF PERSONAL IDENTITY\\n', 'Locke seems to confirm this interpretation when he refers to consciousness as that\\n', '“whereby I am my self to my self,” and then continues by saying,\\n', 'If there be any part of its Existence, which I cannot upon recollection join with that present\\n', 'consciousness, whereby I am now my self, it is in that part of its Existence no more my self, than\\n', 'any other immaterial Being.

As early as John Sergeant and Joseph Butler, Locke’s\\n', 'theory was accused of circularity, since knowing that one is identical to a past self, namely\\n', 'having a veridical memory of a past thought or action, presupposes that the criterion has\\n', 'already been met; there is already an identical self to know.10\\n', 'One way to address this problem, while still seeing personal identity as dependent on\\n', 'the attribution of past thoughts and actions to a self, is to see consciousness as not\\n', 'strictly identical to memory. As Mackie (1976: 178) first stated, rather, consciousness\\n', 'consists in the awareness of one’s thoughts and actions from the “inside.” So, in\\n', 'addition to any memories that are there, consciousness would include whatever I can\\n', 'attribute to myself in any moment—whatever I experience as mine. Thiel (2011: 210)\\n', 'puts it this way: “to Locke, whatever it is that I ascribe to myself through consciousness\\n', 'or memory is part of my personality, if not part of my self as a man or soul.

Locke seems to think that I must be able to remember a\\n', 'specific past action in order to be held responsible for it: “For whatsoever any\\n', 'Substance has thought or done, which I cannot recollect, and by my consciousness\\n', 'make my own Thought or Action, it will no more belong to me, whether a part of\\n', 'me thought or did it, than if it had been thought or done by any other immaterial\\n', 'Being any where existing” (II.xxvii.24). This criticism can be extended to Winkler’s\\n', '(1998: 156), Garrett’s (2003: 103), and LoLordo’s (2012: 70n16) attempts to address\\n', 'the transitivity problem by arguing that in consciously appropriating any thought\\n', 'or action of a past self I automatically appropriate all the thoughts and actions of\\n', 'that self. For the same reasons, we can see why this does not work: attribution of\\n', 'moral responsibility seems to require that one actually remember the specific\\n', 'past action.16\\n', 'Finally, Yaffe’s (2007: 228) unique “susceptibility to punishment theory” argues\\n', 'that Locke reverses the “assumed order of priority of the metaphysical and the\\n', 'moral.” Facts about just punishment and reward ground the identity of a person,\\n', 'rather than the other way around, which avoids circularity for Locke. I note several\\n', 'objections to Yaffe’s interpretation later in the chapter. But even if we allow that he\\n', 'solves circularity, the interpretation does not seem to maintain transitivity.

But, unfortunately, because the relation of just punishment is not transitive,\\n', 'neither is the personal identity relation.17\\n', 'The general problem seems to be that Locke needs an objective criterion for the\\n', 'continued existence of the person in order to avoid circularity, be sufficient for divine\\n', 'rectification, and maintain logical transitivity.

It is the one that provokes the objections already mentioned.

The second sense of\\n', 'consciousness, which is needed to answer the objections, is the objective fact of an\\n', 'ongoing consciousness. ‘Objective’ is meant to describe something that is epistemic-\\n', 'ally available from a third-personal (maybe only God’s) point of view. The ongoing\\n', 'self that I am aware of in being conscious of past and present thoughts and actions\\n', 'seems also to have an objective continued temporal existence through any gaps in my\\n', 'successive, subjective states of awareness of myself.21 Disambiguating these two\\n', 'senses of consciousness allows for a metaphysical fact, what I am also calling an\\n', '‘objective fact,’ of my diachronic existence.

The only other exception I have found, also mentioned earlier, is Yaffe (2007: 226), who argues that we should attribute to Locke “the susceptibility-to-punishment theory of personal identity.” First, consciousness should be understood as the awareness of pleasure and pain. Second, x and y have the same consciousness “just in case the earlier’s actions are a potential source of pleasure or pain for the later.”\\n', 'Third, to avoid the objection that someone else’s action might be a source of my future pain Yaffe includes the element of desert. So, whether I am the same person now as I was in the past is determined by the fact that I am susceptible to punishment now for what a past person did. Yaffe (2007: 228–9) then argues that Locke replaces the metaphysical fact of personal identity with the moral fact of just desert: “the metaphysical facts—the facts about who is the same person as whom—just are the moral facts; they are facts about who is appropriately punished or rewarded for whose past acts.” Although I think Yaffe’s interpretation cleverly finds an objective criterion on which to base personal identity, it is not clear that Locke would endorse the priority of the moral fact over the metaphysical fact. Although Locke does say that “almost all”\\n', 'our perceptions of ideas are accompanied by perceptions of ideas of pleasure and pain, not all our thoughts and actions are moral; that is, they do not all involve being compared to laws and deserving of reward or punishment. Therefore, the self does not continue to exist between times of nonmoral actions—or no\\n', 'actions at all.

According to Locke, the duration designated by a single perception of an\\n', 'idea is an “instant.” He says, “Such a part of Duration as this, wherein we perceive no\\n', 'Succession, is that which we may call an Instant; and is that which takes up the time of\\n', 'only one Idea in our Minds, without the Succession of another, wherein therefore we\\n', 'perceive no Succession at all” (II.xiv.10). Furthermore, Locke asserts that ‘duration’ is\\n', 'a synonym for ‘continued existence’: “we call the Existence, or the Continuation of\\n', 'the Existence of our selves, or anything else, Commensurate to the succession of any\\n', 'Ideas in our Minds, the Duration of our selves, or any such other thing co-existing\\n', 'with our Thinking” (II.xiv.3). And even though we can have only a momentary idea\\n', 'of our own duration or of the duration of any other thing, Locke seems to be saying\\n', 'that things endure through our successive perceptions of ideas of them.

Furthermore, God can know the\\n', 'continued existence of things as they persist through those ideas by which we\\n', 'measure them.

So, duration is the ongoing temporal\\n', 'existence of any thing as measured by a single perception of an idea, as measured\\n', 'between two immediately successive ideas, or even as measured between any gaps in\\n', 'my awareness of myself as thinking—say between the last idea I had prior to falling\\n', 'into a dreamless sleep and the first idea I had upon waking.

Moreover, Cudworth (1678: 159) holds that this ‘Duplication’ of the self as subject and object via consciousness makes a being “to perceive it self to Do or Suffer, and to have a Fruition or Enjoyment of it self.” Consciousness as a fundamental form of self-reference allows for these other kinds of experiences of ourselves. See, again, Thiel (1991, 2011), Lähteenmäki (2010), and Pécharman (2014).\\n', '\\n', '28 This is often referred to as Locke’s “place-time-kind principle.” See Gordon-Roth (2015a) for a recent investigation into the various ways in which the principle is interpreted in the literature.\\n', '\\n', '29 See II.xxvii.4–6.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CONSCIOUSNESS IN LOCKE’S THEORY OF PERSONAL IDENTITY\\n', '\\n', 'The Question being what makes the same Person, and not whether it be the same identical\\n', 'Substance, which always thinks in the same Person, which in this case matters not at all.\\n', '\\n', 'Different Substances by the same consciousness (where they do partake in it) being united into\\n', 'one Person; as well as different Bodies, by the same Life are united into one Animal, whose\\n', 'Identity is preserved, in that change of Substances, by the Unity of one continued Life.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxvii.10)\\n', 'It is reasonable to conclude that a person is individuated when consciousness begins\\n', 'to exist, and that the identity of the person corresponds to the continued existence of\\n', 'that particular consciousness.30 So, Locke must be thinking that consciousness has a\\n', 'continued existence.\\n', '\\n', 'Furthermore, the continued existence of consciousness cannot be merely the\\n', 'awareness of past thoughts and actions. Locke defines a person as “a thinking\\n', 'intelligent Being, that has reason and reflection, and can consider it self as it self,\\n', 'the same thinking thing in different times and places, which it does only by that\\n', 'consciousness” (II.xxvii.9). Since thinking is a succession of momentary ideas, each\\n', 'individual perception of an idea has no continued existence of its own.31 Thus, the\\n', 'only way a person can be the same from thought to thought is if consciousness has a\\n', 'continued existence from thought to thought. To employ the model of consciousness\\n', 'and its relation to perception from chapter two, the analogy would be that just as\\n', 'consciousness as a state of awareness of myself is a constituent of an act of thinking,\\n', 'yet something psychologically different from an act of thinking, consciousness as the\\n', 'ongoing self bears some sort of relation to the train of successive perceptions of ideas,\\n', 'yet is something metaphysically different from them.

In the next two sections, Locke confirms that “The Case is not so much\\n', 'different in Brutes” (II.xxvii.5) or in human beings (II.xxvii.6).

Locke argues that substance cannot be the criterion, since being\\n', 'conscious of one’s past actions (having occurrent mental states) is what generates\\n', 'concern, moral responsibility, and a sense of oneself through time. Therefore, when it\\n', '41 Although I find much of Downing’s view compelling, this is the extent to which my view is\\n', 'committed to it.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' CONSCIOUSNESS IN LOCKE’S THEORY OF PERSONAL IDENTITY\\n', 'comes to personal identity, it seems that Locke is really interested in a psychological, not\\n', 'a metaphysical criterion. Second, what is the relation between consciousness and those\\n', 'occurrent mental states (memory)? These two questions are related in that those\\n', 'passages arguing that personal identity does not consist in substance are mostly the\\n', 'same passages in which Locke refers to “consciousness” as “consciousness of past\\n', 'actions,” namely occurrent (or remembered) mental states. Although this is textual\\n', 'evidence that Locke sees the criterion of personal identity as only psychological, I will\\n', 'argue that Locke’s considered view of the relation between consciousness and memory\\n', 'cuts against this reading by requiring an actual consciousness/mind/body composite to\\n', 'generate those mental states required for a first-personal concern for oneself and one’s\\n', 'actions. The importance of our psychological states for our experience of our own\\n', 'identity, therefore, does not preclude that Locke’s theory also includes a metaphysical\\n', 'criterion.\\n', '\\n', 'As for the first question, why would Locke allow a metaphysical criterion, a\\n', 'continuing consciousness, as an objective criterion for personal identity when he\\n', 'argues so vehemently against the view that substance can play the same role? I have\\n', 'four responses. First, I suggest that Locke is not against a metaphysical criterion, but\\n', 'only against allowing substance to serve as that criterion. As we know, Locke is\\n', 'agnostic as to the ultimate metaphysical nature of the world, and what we can know\\n', 'of it is only through our experience, namely through the ideas we have. Moreover,\\n', 'Locke is interested in the spatio temporal identity of things, which suggests that he is\\n', 'interested in actual things as they persist through time. Indeed, the first eight sections\\n', 'of II.xxvii are devoted to an analysis of what we should consider when we ask about\\n', 'the spatio temporal identity conditions of different kinds of things. In II.xxvii.8,\\n', 'Locke makes the point that old definitions of ‘human being’ should not rule our\\n', 'considerations, because the traditional idea (‘rational animal’) is ill equipped to\\n', 'capture what we really think human beings are. Locke’s repeating Prince Maurice’s\\n', 'story of the rational parrot that we would not call a man (because it does not have the\\n', 'right body shape) is evidence that Locke wants to reconsider identity conditions,\\n', 'including personal identity conditions, unhindered by traditional ideas.\\n', '\\n', 'Second, Locke thinks, at least in principle, that bodies, minds, and consciousnesses\\n', 'can be separated. But though Locke’s thought experiments (about the separation and\\n', 'transfer of bodies, minds, and consciousnesses) are meant to drive our thinking\\n', 'about what constitutes personal identity, I take them to represent mere possibilities.42\\n', 'So, even though it is possible that whatever configuration of real constitutions\\n', 'responsible for my conscious states can exist on its own, it will not be found without\\n', 'those configurations responsible for my mind (thinking) and my body.43 Locke\\n', '42 For more on the nature of Locke’s thought experiments, see Soles and Bradfield (2001).\\n', '\\n', '43 See II.i.20, where Locke says, “I see no reason therefore to believe, that the Soul thinks before the Senses have furnish’d it with Ideas to think on.” I take this to mean that both the body (sense organs) and the mind are necessary for thinking.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CONSCIOUSNESS IN LOCKE’S THEORY OF PERSONAL IDENTITY\\n', '\\n', 'thinks we are mind/body composites (human beings) regardless of what minds or\\n', 'bodies turn out to be.

Locke tells us that we are con-\\n', 'scious of all of our thinking (II.i.19) and that consciousness “is inseparable from\\n', 'thinking” (II.xxvii.9). But he also claims that we have periods of dreamless sleep in\\n', 'which there is no thinking and therefore also no consciousness that we are thinking.\\n', '\\n', 'I have argued that consciousness in one sense is a state of awareness that I am\\n', 'thinking.

We can, however, see\\n', 'consciousness as a self-conscious reflexive perception internal to (yet not identical\\n', 'to) any act of perception. This relation between our mental states is fully consistent\\n', 'with the claim that metaphysically we are created as body/mind/consciousness\\n', 'composites—or as single beings in which these parts are somehow united and act\\n', 'together. Likewise, the mental state that is consciousness is not identical to the mental\\n', 'state that is the perception of an idea; yet they are somehow united and work\\n', 'together.

Chappell (1989: 78ff) argues for a similar view. Quite a lot of literature exists on the ontology of persons in Locke. For more recent arguments that persons are substances, see Gordon-Roth (2015b) and Rickless (2015). For recent views that persons are modes, see Thiel (2011) and LoLordo (2012).

That that model of the relation of consciousness to perception is a common thread running through other areas of Locke’s philosophy has been argued in the succeeding chapters. The relation of consciousness to the sense of concern we have for ourselves, and the role of the unity of consciousness in moral responsibility and motivation, is the topic of chapter five.\\n', '\\n', '46 A more thoroughgoing analysis of this passage comes shortly.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' CONSCIOUSNESS IN LOCKE’S THEORY OF PERSONAL IDENTITY\\n', '(or what we “ordinarily” think, or what is the more “probable Opinion”) we know\\n', 'what it is.47\\n', 'Third, I suggest that although being aware of our occurrent mental states as our\\n', 'own is necessary for having an experience of ourselves as temporally extended and for\\n', 'experiencing concern for past and future pleasures and pains, it is not sufficient for\\n', 'personal identity.

But our Ideas being nothing, but actual Perceptions in the\\n', 'Mind, which cease to be any thing, when there is no perception of them, this laying up of our\\n', 'Ideas in the Repository of Memory, signifies no more but this, that the Mind has a Power, in\\n', 'many cases, to revive Perceptions, which it has once had, with this additional Perception\\n', 'annexed to them, that it has had them before. And in this Sense it is, that our Ideas are said to\\n', 'be in our Memories, when indeed, they are actually no where, but only there is an ability in the\\n', 'Mind, when it will, to revive them again; and as it were paint them anew on it self, though some\\n', 'with more, some with less difficulty; some more lively, others more obscurely. (II.x.2)\\n', 'First, we should see memory as a kind of “Store-house” or “Repository” for ideas that\\n', 'the mind can no longer have in view. But having memories in a repository is not to be\\n', 'confused with having a collection of ideas as normally experienced, say, as images of\\n', 'red and yellow, that can be plucked out as is and reintroduced into the mind. Rather,\\n', 'Locke explains that memories cease to be ideas—in fact they “cease to be any\\n', 'thing”—when they are not the objects of acts of perception. The “laying up of our\\n', 'Ideas in the Repository of Memory,” says Locke, “signifies no more but this, that the\\n', 'Mind has a Power, in many cases, to revive Perceptions” that it has had before. Locke\\n', 'seems to be saying that an instance of remembering is the revival of something that\\n', 'when revived is perceived as an idea, but is not an idea prior to the revival. This is\\n', 'why Locke says that our ideas are “actually no where” before they are revived.\\n', '\\n', 'Nevertheless, there has to be some more to this story, for surely Locke is not saying\\n', 'that the revived idea is uncaused. I suggest that there are two parts to the story. First,\\n', 'there is the question what it is to perceive an idea “from memory” as opposed to\\n', '“from sensation” or as the result of another mental operation. Second, there is the\\n', 'question what a memory consists in prior to being revived.\\n', '\\n', 'Let’s consider the first question. For Locke, the power of the understanding\\n', 'comprises all the powers associated with perception, or thinking (II.vi.2). Having\\n', 'an idea in the mind just is the exercise of the mind’s power of perception in the form\\n', 'of a particular mental operation, say, sensing, reflecting, contemplating, or reviving,\\n', 'as it is directed toward an idea. In the case of sensation, there is an impression in the\\n', 'senses and a power of the mind to perceive, which results in the perception of an idea\\n', '\\n', ' CONSCIOUSNESS IN LOCKE’S THEORY OF PERSONAL IDENTITY\\n', 'of sensation (II.i.24). In the case of having a memory, there is something stored away\\n', 'and a power of the mind to revive (perceive) it, which results in the perception of an\\n', 'idea from memory. In the previous passage from II.x.2, Locke explains that when the\\n', 'mind exercises the power of revival, the ideas perceived come with “this additional\\n', 'Perception annexed to them, that it has had them before.” To repeat some of what\\n', 'was discussed in part II of chapter three, the “additional Perception,” Locke confirms,\\n', 'is due to consciousness:\\n', 'For to remember is to perceive anything with memory, or with a consciousness, that it was\\n', 'known or perceived before: without this, whatever Idea comes into the mind is new, and not\\n', 'remembered: This consciousness of its having been in the mind before, being that, which\\n', 'distinguishes Remembring from all other ways of thinking.\\n', '\\n', '(I.iv.20)\\n', 'These passages seem to indicate that the psychological experience of remembering is\\n', 'due to the consciousness, or awareness, of the way of perceiving when an idea is\\n', 'revived in the mind. Consciousness provides for my experience of my own\\n', 'thinking—that the idea is the result of a reviving instead of, say, an occurrent sensing\\n', 'or a reflecting.\\n', '\\n', 'Locke, as I argued in parts II and III of chapter three, employs consciousness in the\\n', 'same way in his IV.ii.14 account of sensitive knowledge. When I perceive an idea of\\n', 'an external object by way of sensation, I am conscious that it is from sensation. At the\\n', 'risk of repeating this passage yet again, Locke says:\\n', 'But yet here, I think, we are provided with an Evidence, that puts us past doubting: For I ask\\n', 'any one, Whether he be not invincibly conscious to himself of a different Perception, when he\\n', 'looks on the Sun by day, and thinks on it by night. . . . We as plainly find the difference there is between an Idea revived in our Minds by our own Memory, and actually coming into our\\n', 'Minds by our own Senses.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ii.14)\\n', 'The conscious experience of our ideas allows us to identify their perceptual source.\\n', '\\n', 'Therefore, consciousness should neither be confused with memory itself (the “reposi-\\n', 'tory”) nor with the perceptual act or power of revival.\\n', '\\n', 'What is more, defects of memory, for Locke, are defects in thinking, that is, defects\\n', 'involved in reviving ideas, not defects in the consciousness that the ideas revived are\\n', 'from memory. Locke describes the two defects of memory as “ignorance,” when the\\n', 'mind “loses the Idea” completely, and “stupidity,” when the mind acts so slowly that\\n', 'the ideas are not revived “when need and occasion calls for them” (II.x.8). In either\\n', 'case, forgetfulness has nothing to do with consciousness. True, to have the experience\\n', 'that I am remembering or that I am the same self now that I was in the past requires\\n', 'that I be able to revive an idea. But this does not mean that what is involved\\n', 'in reviving an idea should be identified with the consciousness that I have had that\\n', 'idea before.\\n', '\\n', 'What, then, is the metaphysical explanation for memory? How can Locke say that\\n', 'ideas are “no thing” prior to being objects of acts of perception? I suggest that Locke\\n', '\\n', 'CONSCIOUSNESS IN LOCKE’S THEORY OF PERSONAL IDENTITY\\n', '\\n', 'says this because we have no conscious experience of whatever precedes an idea. And,\\n', 'although, for Locke, all thinking is conscious, the ideas must be revived before what is\\n', 'in the mind counts as thinking—since thinking just is having ideas. So it is not\\n', 'inconsistent with Locke’s view that there is something prior to thinking that might\\n', 'result in thinking that is not conscious, that is, not yet a mental item of experience.\\n', '\\n', 'We get some indication of what this something might be for Locke at the end of\\n', 'II.x. Here Locke argues that not only humans but other animals, too, have this\\n', '“faculty of laying up, and retaining the Ideas, that are brought into the mind”\\n', '(II.x.10). Not only do sounds “mechanically cause a certain motion of the animal\\n', 'Spirits, in the Brains of those Birds, whilst the tune is actually playing,” which then\\n', 'results in particular motions of the wings or body, but also birds are able to recall a\\n', 'sequence of notes when they are no longer directly affected through their senses or\\n', 'when the imitation is necessary for preservation. What explains memory in the case\\n', 'of other animals? Locke says:\\n', 'But which is more, it cannot with any appearance of Reason, be supposed (much less proved)\\n', 'that Birds, without Sense and Memory, can approach their Notes, nearer and nearer by\\n', 'degrees, to a Tune play’d yesterday; which if they have no Idea of in their Memory, is now\\n', 'no-where, nor can be a Pattern for them to imitate, or which any repeated Essays can bring\\n', 'them nearer to. Since there is no reason why the sound of a Pipe should leave traces in their\\n', 'Brains, which not at first, but by their after-endeavors, should produce the like Sounds; and\\n', 'why the Sounds they make themselves, should not make traces which they should follow, as\\n', 'well as those of the Pipe, is impossible to conceive.\\n', '\\n', '(II.x.10)\\n', 'Although a little difficult to follow, Locke is suggesting that the ability birds have to\\n', 'repeat a pattern or imitate a tune is due to the ability to record what they have\\n', 'experienced as traces in the brain, which “by their after-endeavours” result in a later\\n', 'production of those sounds.51 It is quite plausible to think that the case is similar in\\n', 'human beings. What is laid up or stored away “in memory” are traces in the brain\\n', 'that with an effort of the mind to revive become ideas perceived in the mind.52\\n', 'We see a similar account of a relation between the mind and the body in the\\n', 'perception of ideas in Locke’s II.i.23 account of the “origin” of ideas.

In either case, though, for Locke, there is unity of consciousness, since the technical sense of reflection takes another act of perception (a mental operation) as its object. As I will discuss in more detail in chapter five, whenever there are simultaneous perceptions of ideas (or acts of perception), there will be an experience of unity of consciousness.\\n', '\\n', '57 See, again, chapter three, section 3.II.4, and section 4.2 of this chapter for Locke’s account of memory and particularly the phenomenology of memory.

Drawing a\\n', 'comparison between Locke and Descartes and their different requirements for\\n', 'what counts as knowledge of the synchronic and diachronic existence of the self is\\n', 'helpful here. Descartes establishes the synchronic existence of the self through the\\n', 'cogito argument: “So after considering everything very thoroughly, I must finally\\n', 'conclude that this proposition, I am, I exist, is necessarily true whenever it is put\\n', 'forward by me or conceived in my mind” (CSM II: 16; AT VII: 25). Now it is not in\\n', 'the least controversial to attribute to Descartes the view that we also continue to exist\\n', 'through time.58 But Descartes struggles with establishing the fact of the diachronic-\\n', 'ally existing self. In the “Synopsis” to the Meditations, Descartes admits that in order\\n', 'to establish the continuity of the soul, and thus its immortality, he would have to give\\n', '“an account of the whole of physics” (CSM II: 10; AT VII: 14).

This is one place\\n', 'where Locke’s epistemology departs from Descartes’s.59 As we saw in part III of\\n', 'chapter three, Locke has different epistemic standards.

Despite Descartes’s own lack of\\n', 'philosophical justification for the continued existence of the self, McCann suggests a way in which Descartes could have made that case. McCann’s argument goes roughly like this: The diachronic identity of anything is determined by what persists through change. For Descartes, substances are conceived\\n', 'through their primary attribute, which in the case of material substances is extension. From the Second Meditation example of the wax, what persists through changes in corporeal substance is extension. Since what persists through changes in thinking substances is thinking, namely the principle attribute, we can draw the analogy that just as extension provides material continuity through time, thinking (as memory) provides psychological continuity through time.\\n', '\\n', '59 Another place is Descartes’s understanding of all knowledge as requiring an act of the will.\\n', '\\n', '60 Because the important parallels are concerned with the immediately perceived agreements (non-\\n', 'inferential knowledge), demonstrative knowledge is not relevant to the argument.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CONSCIOUSNESS IN LOCKE’S THEORY OF PERSONAL IDENTITY\\n', '\\n', 'knowledge carry different degrees of certainty.

Similarly, I have sensitive\\n', 'knowledge as the result of the complexity of the perception of an occurrent idea of\\n', 'sensation.

Nevertheless, given the interpretation of Locke’s theory of\\n', 'knowledge as argued for in the last chapter, these parallels can be elicited.\\n', '\\n', 'Interestingly, too, Kant, in the third paralogism, makes a parallel point with\\n', 'respect to the difference between the inevitability of our cognitive experience and\\n', 'what is epistemically justified from an external point of view. In order to cognize the\\n', 'identity of something, I attend to what persists against the background of what\\n', 'changes. In cognizing my own identity I attend to the persistence of the I against\\n', 'the background of “successive determinations” of the I, namely through the time of\\n', 'the successive instances of the I as thinking. Since time is the form of inner sense, the\\n', 'experience of my own thinking is necessarily of myself as unified in time. Kant states,\\n', '“The identity of the person is therefore inevitably to be encountered in my own\\n', 'consciousness.”62 Even so, for Kant, we cannot from the inevitability of our own\\n', 'cognitive experience draw the further conclusion that we are something persisting\\n', 'through time:\\n', 'For we cannot judge even from our own consciousness whether as soul we are persisting or not,\\n', 'because we ascribe to our identical Self only that of which we are conscious; and so we must\\n', 'necessarily judge that we are the very same in the whole of the time of which we are conscious.\\n', '\\n', 'But from the standpoint of someone else we cannot declare this to be valid because, since in the\\n', 'soul we encounter no persisting appearance other than the representation “I,” which accom-\\n', 'panies and connects all of them, we can never make out whether this I (a mere thought) does\\n', 'not flow as well as all the other thoughts that are linked to one another through it.63\\n', 'I cite these passages from Kant only to show that drawing the distinction between\\n', 'what is so very certain to us from the point of view of our own cognitive experience,\\n', 'yet at the same time is epistemically unjustifiable from an external point of view, has\\n', 'very much to do with the limits of human understanding. Although the difference\\n', 'between Kant’s and Locke’s philosophical treatment and appreciation of these limits\\n', 'is vast, Locke’s acceptance of the inevitability of what is presented to us in conscious-\\n', 'ness plays a large role in his philosophy.\\n', '\\n', 'I propose that having to admit that we do not know the metaphysical fact of our\\n', 'own diachronic existence beyond the degree of certainty given in our psychological\\n', '62 Kant (1998: 423).\\n', '\\n', '63 Kant (1998: 424).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CONSCIOUSNESS IN LOCKE’S THEORY OF PERSONAL IDENTITY\\n', '\\n', 'experience of it, therefore, is not such a heavy burden for Locke’s theory to bear. After\\n', 'all, Locke is concerned to discover the limits of human understanding, given the\\n', '“Historical, plain Method” of looking to facts of our own experience. The analysis of\\n', 'what constitutes personal identity is just one example where Locke comes up against\\n', 'those limitations. Another example, as previously argued, is in the analysis of\\n', 'sensitive knowledge. Nevertheless, our cognitive limitations with respect to what\\n', 'the senses determine for us have no real impact on our lives, for those limitations do\\n', 'not affect our happiness and misery:\\n', 'But yet if he be resolved to appear so sceptical, as to maintain, that what I call being actually in the Fire, is nothing but a Dream; and that we cannot thereby certainly know, that any such\\n', 'thing as Fire actually exists without us: I answer, That we certainly finding that Pleasure or Pain follows upon the application of certain Objects to us, whose Existence we perceive, or dream\\n', 'that we perceive, by our Senses, this certainty is as great as our Happiness, or Misery, beyond\\n', 'which, we have no concernment to know, or to be.

Therefore,\\n', 'that my sensitive knowledge does not achieve the higher standards of other forms of\\n', 'knowledge has no real impact on what is most important to me.\\n', '\\n', 'Interestingly enough, Locke has the same sort of reply to what we might call the\\n', 'skeptical concern with respect to personal identity. Although the argument is not\\n', 'structurally the same, the point is the same: We need not have full epistemic warrant\\n', 'concerning the metaphysical fact of our or someone else’s diachronic existence in\\n', 'order to have knowledge sufficient for our concerns. With respect to personal\\n', 'identity, the skeptical concern gains importance in issues of moral responsibility.\\n', '\\n', 'Whether or not I am the same person from time to time is crucial for determinations\\n', 'of just reward and punishment. Moreover, as I have argued, Locke thinks there is a\\n', 'metaphysical fact of our continued existence. Thus he says,\\n', 'But is not a man Drunk and Sober the same Person, why else is he punish’d for the Fact he\\n', 'commits when Drunk, though he be never afterwards conscious of it?

For punishment is assigned to the person,\\n', 'insofar as he continues to exist through the succession of momentary thoughts and\\n', 'actions. Though the drunkard and the sleepwalker experience gaps in their awareness\\n', 'of themselves as perceiving ideas, nevertheless, there is a fact of their ongoing\\n', '\\n', ' CONSCIOUSNESS IN LOCKE’S THEORY OF PERSONAL IDENTITY\\n', 'existence through those gaps. And even though we do not have full epistemic warrant\\n', 'that they are the same person, the degree to which the evidence points in that\\n', 'direction far outweighs the very unlikely possibility that there are gaps in their\\n', 'existences corresponding to their inability to remember their actions. Therefore,\\n', 'Locke continues that\\n', 'Humane Laws punish both [the drunkard and the sleepwalker] with a Justice suitable to their\\n', 'way of Knowledge: Because in these cases, they cannot distinguish certainly what is real, what\\n', 'counterfeit; and so the ignorance in Drunkenness or Sleep is not admitted as a plea. For though\\n', 'punishment be annexed to personality, and personality to consciousness, and the Drunkard\\n', 'perhaps be not conscious of what he did; yet Human Judicatures justly punish him; because the\\n', 'Fact is proved against him, but want of consciousness cannot be proved for him.

Though courts of law cannot\\n', 'from an external point of view “distinguish certainly what is real, what counterfeit”\\n', 'with respect to the metaphysical fact of the drunkard’s continued existence, prosecu-\\n', 'tors are capable of generating a barrage of reasons pointing to that fact. Indeed, Locke\\n', 'asserts that in some matters of fact, especially those that are of great concern to us,\\n', 'the “Probabilities rise so near to certainty . . . we make little or no difference between\\n', 'them and certain knowledge” (IV.xvi.6). So, the drunkard’s plea that he cannot\\n', 'remember the crime cannot be given much evidential weight in light of all the other\\n', 'reasons pointing to the fact that he committed the crime.\\n', '\\n', 'But notice that Locke does account for the case in which the drunkard’s or the\\n', 'sleepwalker’s gap in consciousness truly coincides with a gap in his continued\\n', 'existence. It is a very remote possibility, but a possibility nonetheless—much like\\n', 'the possibility that all is a dream or that I am the victim of an evil demon. But Locke\\n', 'has a solution to this too. In the extraordinarily unlikely event that the drunkard’s\\n', 'lack of memory actually does correspond to a gap in his continued existence, God\\n', 'will ensure his just deserts. Once all of one’s continued existence is accounted for in\\n', 'the day of reckoning, “no one shall be made to answer for what he knows nothing of.”\\n', 'Locke’s example of the drunkard confronts us with the limits of our knowledge.

Even though my knowledge of the metaphysical fact of my\\n', 'diachronic existence is incomplete, and hence I do not know all that I have done, God\\n', 'does.

Therefore, our cognitive limitations with respect to\\n', 'having full knowledge of our own diachronic identity do not affect what is most\\n', 'important to us, namely our eternal happiness and misery.\\n', '\\n', '4.4 Conclusion\\n', 'Traditionally, Locke is considered to have a psychological account of personal\\n', 'identity that relies on consciousness as the criterion. The criticisms it has faced are\\n', 'numerous. If the psychological theory is taken also as a metaphysical theory, then\\n', 'there is a problem of circularity. If Locke is interpreted to have an appropriation\\n', 'theory, in which the first-personal attribution to ourselves of occurrent mental states\\n', 'is sufficient for personal identity, then the theory fails transitivity or it is ill equipped\\n', 'to meet the demands of Locke’s commitment to divine rectification. Consciousness\\n', 'must be something persisting metaphysically for there to be sufficient connectivity\\n', 'through memory between past and present selves for transitivity to hold and for there\\n', 'to be something for God to look to in determining those actions for which we can be\\n', 'justly punished or rewarded. Those who bolster a reliance on appropriation with a\\n', 'causal relation between an idea originally perceived and an idea revived from\\n', 'memory may provide enough for divine rectification, but they saddle Locke with\\n', 'an inconsistency when it comes to his claims about consciousness transference and\\n', 'false memory. And those interpretations do not resolve the problem of transitivity.\\n', '\\n', 'Moreover, Locke is adamant that the objective metaphysical criterion, what has\\n', 'ongoing continuity, is not substance, nor did he give a nod to the “probable Opinion”\\n', 'that it might be a mode. I have argued, rather, that Locke remains agnostic about the\\n', 'metaphysics of an enduring consciousness except that it is consistent with a broader\\n', 'metaphysics of real constitutions and power. Consistent with this view, I have argued\\n', 'that Locke sees persons as mind/body/consciousness composites in which all three\\n', 'components are configurations of real constitutions that are somehow united. In\\n', '\\n', ' CONSCIOUSNESS IN LOCKE’S THEORY OF PERSONAL IDENTITY\\n', 'addition, I have argued that Locke’s metaphysical account of memory as consisting in\\n', 'causal traces in the brain helps to support the interpretation that we are mind/body/\\n', 'consciousness composites, and that although occurrent mental states are necessary to\\n', 'experience and identify myself as the same self, it is the ongoing consciousness that\\n', 'does the work from a third-personal point of view. Thus, I have succeeded in solving\\n', 'all three of the problems traditionally associated with Locke’s theory of personal\\n', 'identity, and I have done it without causing tensions elsewhere in Locke’s philosophy.\\n', '\\n', 'Finally, I have argued that Locke uses ‘consciousness’ ambiguously both to mean a\\n', 'state of awareness of myself as thinking and as the ongoing self I am aware of in that\\n', 'conscious state. Where the metaphysical fact of my ongoing self is revealed to me as a\\n', 'phenomenological experience of a diachronic self, the metaphysical fact (known only\\n', 'to God) is beyond my ken. Analogously to both the epistemic achievements and\\n', 'limitations of sensitive knowledge, I have the utmost psychological certainty that\\n', 'I exist in every moment, but that knowledge does not stand up to a second-order\\n', 'normative challenge.\\n', '\\n', 'Having shown the role consciousness plays in Locke’s account of personal identity,\\n', 'I now want to turn to the role it plays in his account of moral agency and more\\n', 'specifically in his account of freedom and moral motivation. First, that we are able to\\n', 'exercise moral agency is tied to the fact that we are the kind of self-conscious beings we\\n', 'are, namely beings with an intellectual nature conscious of pleasure and pain, and so\\n', 'concerned for our own true happiness. In addition, as we have seen only briefly,\\n', 'consciousness as intrinsic to every perception of an idea allows that we can experience\\n', 'unity of consciousness, that is, experience ourselves as extended into the past. Such an\\n', 'experience affords us the opportunity to see past thoughts and actions as ours and\\n', 'thus to be morally accountable for them. But also Locke thinks we experience\\n', 'ourselves as extending into the future. That we experience unity of consciousness in\\n', 'this direction allows us to exercise our agency in the pursuit of long-term happiness,\\n', 'namely the kind of happiness suitable to a moral being.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '5\\n', 'Consciousness and Moral\\n', 'Motivation\\n', 'Along with its importance in Locke’s philosophical psychology and his theories of\\n', 'knowledge and personal identity, consciousness plays a significant role in Locke’s\\n', 'account of moral agency. It does so in two ways. First, as we saw in the last chapter,\\n', 'taking responsibility for the actions of a past self requires that we are able to see a past\\n', 'self as the same as a present self. But also, as I argue toward the end of this chapter, in\\n', 'order to be properly motivated to pursue that which brings the most pleasure, or\\n', 'happiness, we must be able to see ourselves as extending into the future: we must\\n', 'have an experience of a future self. Consciousness as a self-referential awareness\\n', 'internal to any mental act allows for these experiences of diachronic unity of\\n', 'consciousness. Second, along with its role in our experience of past and future selves,\\n', 'consciousness is crucial to Locke’s account of moral agency in another important\\n', 'way. Moral agency, for Locke, requires that we are free enough to deliberate ration-\\n', 'ally about competing goods. We must be able to suspend a particular desire to assess\\n', 'whether or not it really does lead to pleasure (rather than pain) in the longer term.\\n', '\\n', 'But the suspension of desire necessary to Locke’s account of moral agency requires\\n', 'some sort of motivation. I argue that that motivation comes from a natural concern\\n', 'we have for our own true happiness that is grounded in the fact that we are the kind\\n', 'of self-conscious beings that we are—intellectual beings conscious of their own\\n', 'pleasures and pains. This latter argument, establishing the motivating power of our\\n', 'concern for true happiness, is the primary focus of this chapter and to what I will turn\\n', 'first. As is well known, in response to concerns expressed by Molyneux and others\\n', 'about his original account of moral action, Locke revised his view significantly for the\\n', 'second edition of the Essay. In what follows, I will be considering only the account of\\n', 'moral agency and motivation as we find it in the second through fifth editions.\\n', '\\n', 'Locke’s theory of moral motivation is grounded in our natural responses to feelings\\n', 'of pleasure and pain. Feelings of pain lead to desires, which move the will to act to\\n', 'attain the objects of those desires. Attaining those objects, what Locke calls “absent\\n', 'goods,” results in pleasure—the alleviation of pain. What is more, “Happiness . . . in its\\n', 'full extent is the utmost Pleasure we are capable of, and Misery the utmost Pain: And\\n', 'the lowest degree of what can be called Happiness, is so much ease from all Pain, . . . as\\n', 'without which any one cannot be content” (II.xxi.42). Locke links our natural\\n', '\\n', ' CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', 'motivation to alleviate pain to our physical self-preservation. He writes of “the Wisdom\\n', 'and Goodness of our Maker, who designing the preservation of our being, has annexed\\n', 'Pain to the application of many things to our Bodies, to warn us of the harm they will do;\\n', 'and as advices to withdraw from them” (II.vii.4). Such motivation to physical preser-\\n', 'vation is a way in which we are naturally constructed, helping to put us on the path to\\n', 'happiness rather than misery. Indeed, Locke thinks that were we not naturally able to\\n', 'avoid things that lead to our own demise, we would be “created miserable.”1\\n', 'In this chapter, I argue that just as we have a natural drive toward our own physical\\n', 'self-preservation here and now, we also have a natural drive toward our long-term\\n', 'preservation, what Locke calls our “true” or “real” happiness, which consists in\\n', 'attaining the most pleasure in this life and the next. To attain long-term happiness,\\n', 'though, we must be able to choose greater goods, including those that might make us\\n', 'suffer now but bring more pleasure later. And doing that requires that we have the\\n', 'freedom to forbear acting on a present desire. Locke thinks that we do have such\\n', 'freedom, for we are able to suspend desire in order to deliberate over the relative\\n', 'pleasures of competing goods. In Locke’s moral theory, this means we can consider\\n', 'our actions insofar as they compare to laws, conferring on us moral agency and moral\\n', 'responsibility. But only desire moves the will to an action, so there must be a desire\\n', 'that results in the suspension of desire. The scholarship has been generally satisfied\\n', 'with attributing this motivation to a desire for happiness in general, but there is little\\n', 'agreement with respect to how to interpret it. Chappell (2000: 242), for example,\\n', 'argues that the desire for happiness in general moves the will to suspend desire: “this\\n', 'desire constitutes a constant and unalterable spur to the will, a source of motivation\\n', 'over and above that which is made up of the sundry particular uneasinesses that fill\\n', 'our daily lives.” Yaffe (2000: 57) grounds what he calls the “Elusive Something,”\\n', 'namely that which grounds any liberty “worth the name” in the desire for happiness\\n', 'in general, which pursuit he understands as not only choosing the good, “but to track\\n', 'the good, to be ‘tied’ to the good no matter where it lies.” Bolton (2008: 262)\\n', 'considers the desire for happiness in general an “innate conative principle” by virtue\\n', 'of which “Locke’s theory gives everyone a motive to inquire about the prospect of\\n', 'happiness or misery after death” in an argument establishing the way in which Locke\\n', 'sees the difference between moral and cognitive duties. LoLordo (2012: 59) takes a\\n', 'more agnostic view, arguing that the “most plausible conclusion is that Locke simply\\n', 'does not know what, if anything, causes suspension.” Schouls (1992: 145) argues that\\n', 'the will to suspend desire is not “to be explained through the kind of uneasiness that\\n', '1 I am interpreting Locke’s understanding of what it means to be “created miserable” somewhat loosely.\\n', '\\n', 'Although Locke uses the term only with reference to being punished for actions that we cannot attribute to ourselves, he also says, “And to receive Pleasure or Pain; i.e. Reward or Punishment, on the account of any such Action, is all one, as to be made happy or miserable in its first being, without any demerit at all . . . what difference is there between that Punishment, and being created miserable?” (II.xxvii.26).\\n', '\\n', 'I take this to mean more generally that being in a state in which we cannot but receive pain or misery through no fault of our own, say, because God has not fitted us with what we need to attain happiness (or avoid misery), is the same as “to be made happy or miserable in its first being.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', '\\n', 'would make these acts manifestations of the mechanism of nature.” Stuart (2013:\\n', '473) provides a detailed account of the two views in the scholarship as well as good\\n', 'textual evidence that although at times Locke might have seemed to lean toward\\n', 'incompatibilism, “All told, there is little evidence that Locke took himself to have\\n', 'offered a solution to the problem of freedom and determinism, and even less that he\\n', 'saw our capacity to suspend the prosecution of desires as a way of resisting incorp-\\n', 'oration into the mechanism of nature.”2\\n', 'Unfortunately, Locke seems not to provide us much explicit help with answering\\n', 'the question of what causes suspension. But he does say, “Whatever necessity\\n', 'determines to the pursuit of real Bliss, the same necessity, with the same force\\n', 'establishes suspence, deliberation, and scrutiny of each successive desire, whether\\n', 'the satisfaction of it, does not interfere with our true happiness, and mislead us from\\n', 'it” (II.xxi.52). I argue that this necessity, the motivation to pursue “real Bliss”—the\\n', 'same force that establishes the suspension of a desire—is a natural motivation, which\\n', 'Locke often calls our “concern” for our own true happiness.\\n', '\\n', 'To make my case, I will begin, in section 5.1, by drawing out the analogy between\\n', 'present self-preservation and long-term preservation. Section 5.2 argues that even\\n', 'though what is good just is what brings pleasure, Locke distinguishes between pleasure\\n', 'and what he calls “true” happiness, which culminates, ultimately, in an afterlife. In\\n', 'section 5.3, I argue that the motivation to pursue true happiness grounds the freedom\\n', 'Locke thinks is necessary to having moral agency. I also argue that this motivation\\n', 'Locke often calls our “concern” or “concernment” that we gain true happiness. In\\n', 'section 5.4, I tie together consciousness, concern, and moral agency by arguing that\\n', 'the concern for our happiness generally, that it is “true” happiness, is linked to the fact\\n', 'that we are the kind of self-conscious beings we are—that is, beings conscious of their\\n', 'own pleasure and pain, but also with an intellectual nature and so capable of moral\\n', 'agency. I then show, in section 5.5, the importance of the unity of consciousness in\\n', 'Locke’s account of moral agency. Finally, in the last section, I explain why animals,\\n', 'even though conscious (and even self-conscious) for Locke, fail to be moral agents.\\n', '\\n', '5.1 Motivation, Self-Preservation, and Happiness\\n', 'Locke divides the mind into “two great and principal Actions . . . : Perception, or\\n', 'Thinking, and Volition, or Willing. The Power of Thinking is called the Understand-\\n', 'ing, and the Power of Volition is called the Will” (II.vi.2).3 Although Locke uses the\\n', 'language of “faculties” to talk about both the understanding and the will, he warns us\\n', '2 See Walsh (2014: 150) for an analysis of the suspension of desire as a passive power resulting from\\n', '“contradictory information: the promise of pleasure from the present perception combined with uncertainty about the good’s relation to true happiness from remembered information about the good.”\\n', '3 As mention earlier, all acts of the will are conscious: “[C]onsciousness . . . is inseparable from thinking, and it seems to me essential to it. . . . When we see, hear, smell, taste, feel, meditate, or will any thing, we know that we do so” (II.xxvii.9, my emphasis).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', 'that he does not mean by “faculty” what most take it to mean. Talk of “faculties,” he\\n', 'says, “has misled many into a confused Notion of so many distinct Agents in us,\\n', 'which had their several Provinces and Authorities, and did command, obey, and\\n', 'perform several Actions, as so many distinct Beings” (II.xxi.6). Rather, Locke sees\\n', 'both the understanding and the will as a power or ability, the exercise of which is\\n', 'perception, or perceiving, and volition, or willing. Locke’s II.xxi. chapter On Power,\\n', 'among other things, contains his theory of action. Actions require, or are at least\\n', 'accompanied by, prior volitions. Locke acknowledges that it is hard to explain exactly\\n', 'what volition is, but if we look to what we do when we will, we might use the terms,\\n', '“Ordering, Directing, Chusing, Preferring” (II.xxi.15). But he is quick to admit that\\n', 'none of these terms perfectly captures it. For example, someone might prefer to fly\\n', 'rather than to walk, but it cannot be the case that anyone actually wills flying over\\n', 'walking. In general, though, Locke thinks the following is the best description of\\n', 'volition, or willing: “Volition, . . . [is] an Act of the Mind knowingly exerting that\\n', 'Dominion it takes itself to have over any part of the Man, by imploying it in, or\\n', 'withholding it from any particular Action” (II.xxi.15). It is whatever we do when we\\n', 'move from thinking about doing something to actually doing it (or not doing it).4\\n', 'What activates the will such that we are moved to pursue an action? Only desire, or\\n', 'what Locke also calls “uneasiness,” moves the will:5\\n', 'To return then to the Enquiry, what is it that determines the Will in regard to our Actions? And\\n', 'that upon second thoughts I am apt to imagine is not, as is generally supposed, the greater good\\n', 'in view: But some (and for the most part pressing) uneasiness a Man is at present under. This is\\n', 'that which successively determines the Will, and sets us upon those Actions, we perform. This\\n', 'Uneasiness we may call, as it is, Desire; which is an uneasiness of the Mind for want of some\\n', 'absent good. All pain of the body of what sort soever, and disquiet of the mind, is uneasiness:\\n', 'And with this is always join’d Desire, equal to the pain or uneasiness felt; and is scarce\\n', 'distinguishable from it. For desire being nothing but an uneasiness in the want of an absent\\n', 'good, in reference to any pain felt, ease is that absent good; and till that ease be attained, we\\n', 'may call it desire, no body feeling pain, that he wishes not to be erased of, with a desire equal to that pain, and inseparable from it.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.31)\\n', 'How to distinguish desire from uneasiness is not readily clear. Locke will sometimes\\n', 'speak of desire and uneasiness as if they are the same and sometimes as if they are\\n', 'different. I think the above passage makes the distinction. Uneasiness, I take to be\\n', 'equivalent to pain. When we have uneasiness, we have pain. When the pain is associated\\n', 'with an absent good, namely something perceived to alleviate the pain and thus restore\\n', 'us to a state of ease, we have a desire. Desires, then, are always connected with some\\n', 'specific absent good.\\n', '\\n', '4 Notice Locke’s statement that when we will, we know that we do. I suggest that this is a similar use of the term ‘know’ as we find in II.xxvii.9, when Locke equates consciousness with knowing.\\n', '\\n', '5 That uneasiness moves the will to an action is one of the main revisions from the first-edition to the second-edition account of moral agency.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', '\\n', 'One might, however, see the distinction somewhat differently. Uneasiness would be\\n', 'the genus of which pain is a species. That is, uneasinesses come in a spectrum, with pain\\n', 'at the painful end of that spectrum. Although I am open to the suggestion, I am not sure\\n', 'that is what Locke has in mind for the following reasons. First, when Locke first\\n', 'mentions our simple ideas of pleasure and pain, he lists them in the following way:\\n', '“Pleasure, or Delight, and its opposite Pain, or Uneasiness” (II.vii.1). Here Locke seems\\n', 'to be using the “or” in both cases appositively, which signals equivalence. Second, Locke\\n', 'says, “Delight, or Uneasiness, one or other of them join themselves to almost all our\\n', 'Ideas, both of Sensation and Reflection: And there is scarce any affection of our Senses\\n', 'from without, any retired thought of our Mind within, which is not able to produce in us\\n', 'pleasure or pain” (II.vii.2). Given that virtually all our ideas come with some sort of\\n', 'pleasure or pain, Locke seems to be using “pain” to designate “uneasiness” as opposed to\\n', 'the narrower category of uneasinesses that are truly painful. And although Locke goes\\n', 'on to list what appears to be gradations of pleasures and pains when he says, “For\\n', 'whether we call it Satisfaction, Delight, Pleasure, Happiness, etc. on the one side; or\\n', 'Uneasiness, Trouble, Pain, Torment, Anguish, Misery, etc. on the other,” he seems again\\n', 'to equate “pain” with “uneasiness” when he continues the sentence with “they are still\\n', 'but different degrees of the same thing, and belong to the Ideas of Pleasure and Pain,\\n', 'Delight or Uneasiness; which are the Names I shall most commonly use for those two\\n', 'sorts of Ideas” (II.vii.2). Interesting as the question is, I do not think anything in my\\n', 'coming arguments hangs on which interpretation one chooses.\\n', '\\n', 'Even though desires are always connected with an absent good, Locke also admits\\n', 'that we can consider an absent good without feeling uneasy. We will not feel any\\n', 'uneasiness as long as we are content with what we are doing or with what we have\\n', '(or do not have):\\n', 'When a Man is perfectly content with the State he is in, which is when he is perfectly without\\n', 'any uneasiness, what industry, what action, what Will is there left, but to continue in it? Of this every Man’s observation will satisfy him. (II.xxi.34)\\n', 'If it is natural to continue an action as long as it brings pleasure, then one might want\\n', 'to ask why we would ever discontinue a pleasurable activity. Locke answers:\\n', 'And thus we see our All-wise Maker, suitable to our constitution and frame, and knowing what\\n', 'it is that determines the Will, has put into man the uneasiness of hunger and thirst, and other\\n', 'natural desires, that return at their Seasons, to move and determine their Wills, for the\\n', 'preservation of themselves, and the continuation of their species.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.34)\\n', 'Even when we are presently content with what we are doing, natural desires like\\n', 'hunger and thirst, as well as what else is necessary for our physical preservation,\\n', 'interrupt us to provide the requisite motivation to change course. So, regardless of\\n', 'how much at ease I am when engaged in any particular activity, eventually the\\n', 'natural demands of preservation will kick in: I experience the pain of hunger or\\n', 'the need for something to drink. God has designed me such that pains arise from\\n', '\\n', ' CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', 'within my body to push me to pursue an absent greater good—continued physical\\n', 'preservation. We see this also in Locke’s account of the natural annexation of\\n', 'pleasures and pains to sensations:\\n', 'the Wisdom and Goodness of our Maker, who designing the preservation of our being, has\\n', 'annexed Pain to the application of many things to our Bodies, to warn us of the harm they will\\n', 'do; and as advices to withdraw from them.\\n', '\\n', '(II.vii.4)\\n', 'Which is wisely and favourably so ordered by Nature, that when any Object does, by the\\n', 'vehemency of its operation, disorder the instruments of Sensation, whose Structures cannot\\n', 'but be very nice and delicate, we might by the pain, be warned to withdraw, before the Organ\\n', 'be quite put out of order, and so be unfitted for its proper functions for the future. (II.vii.4)6\\n', 'These passages confirm that we have a natural motivation to change course when our\\n', 'physical preservation is threatened. When I look up to the sky, if the light is too\\n', 'bright, I am naturally moved to a different action: to stop looking at the sun. We are\\n', 'naturally moved from that which causes pain to that which alleviates it, or toward\\n', 'that which brings pleasure.\\n', '\\n', 'I suggest that Locke can be seen to have a similar naturalistic explanation of how\\n', 'we can be moved to pursue goods other than those necessary for the present\\n', 'preservation of the body. Consider, first, this passage:\\n', 'Let a Man never be so well perswaded of the advantages of virtue, that it is as necessary to a\\n', 'Man, who has any great aims in this World, or hopes in the next, as food to life: yet till he\\n', 'hungers and thirsts after righteousness; till he feels an uneasiness in the want of it, his will will not be determin’d to any action in pursuit of this confessed greater good; but any other\\n', 'uneasinesses he feels in himself, shall take place, and carry his will to other actions.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.35)\\n', 'Locke’s point is that mere persuasion that a virtuous life is better is not enough to\\n', 'motivate us to choose it. How, then, do we come to experience the uneasiness\\n', 'necessary to cause a change in a present state or manner of living, say, from a non-\\n', 'virtuous to a virtuous life? Locke answers this question with an allusion to those\\n', 'natural pains/uneasinesses leading to the preservation of the body. Virtue, he says, is\\n', 'as necessary to a good life in this world and a better one in the next as food is to the\\n', 'preservation of present physical life. We have to “hunger and thirst” after righteous-\\n', 'ness. We have to feel the pain that the absence of righteousness brings about, just as\\n', 'we hunger and thirst after bodily sustenance, namely feel the uneasiness that the\\n', 'absence of food and water brings about. In other words, virtue is necessary to our\\n', 'long-term happiness in this life and the next, just as food and water are necessary to\\n', 'our preservation here and now.7\\n', '6 See also II.vii.4: “But yet excess of Cold, as well as of Heat, pains us: because it is equally destructive to that temper, which is necessary to the preservation of life, and the exercise of the several functions of the Body, and which consists in a moderate degree of warmth; or if you please in the insensible parts of our Bodies, confin’d within certain bounds.”\\n', '7 See also Chappell (2000), Flage (2000), and Bolton (2008).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', '\\n', 'This argument may invite the objection that Locke uses “virtue” and “vice” to refer\\n', 'only to the keeping of those “Law[s] of Opinion or Reputation,” that are relative to\\n', '“Societies, Tribes, and Clubs of Men in the World” (II.xxviii.10). I suggest, though,\\n', 'that Locke actually distinguishes real virtue and vice from what in different societies\\n', 'is countenanced by laws of reputation as virtue and vice. He says, “Vertue and Vice\\n', 'are Names pretended, and supposed every where to stand for actions in their own\\n', 'nature right and wrong: And as far as they really are so applied, they so far are\\n', 'co-incident with the divine Law above-mentioned” (II.xxviii.10). What Locke seems\\n', 'to be saying is that we normally use the terms “virtue” and “vice” as if they denoted\\n', 'objective determinations of right and wrong actions. But really they stand only for\\n', 'what any particular society deems right and wrong actions. In the last part of\\n', 'the passage, though, Locke admits that one correctly uses “virtue” and “vice” to\\n', 'stand for what is objectively right and wrong when those terms describe actions\\n', 'that are “co-incident with divine Law.” So, Locke must be thinking that there is a way\\n', 'to talk about virtue and vice that is not relative to the laws of reputation of a\\n', 'particular society.\\n', '\\n', 'I suggest Locke is doing just that in the passage cited from II.xxi.35 above and also\\n', 'in this passage from II.xxi.70:\\n', 'He that will allow exquisite and endless Happiness to be but the consequence of a good Life\\n', 'here, and the contrary state the possible Reward of a bad one, must own himself to judge very\\n', 'much amiss, if he does not conclude, That a virtuous Life, with the certain expectation of\\n', 'everlasting Bliss, which may come, is to be preferred to a vicious one, with the fear of that\\n', 'dreadful state of Misery, which ’tis very possible may overtake the guilty; or at best the terrible uncertain hope of Annihilation.\\n', '\\n', 'Colman (2003: 122–3) argues somewhat similarly. First, he cites the following\\n', 'passage from II.xxviii.11. “Men . . . did not for the most part much vary from the\\n', 'Law of Nature, which is that standing and unalterable Rule, by which they ought to\\n', 'judge the moral rectitude and pravity of their actions, and accordingly denominate\\n', 'them Vertues or Vices.” He then explains,\\n', 'Here and in other places Locke’s talk of the law of reputation and the divine law (revealed or\\n', 'law of nature) suggests two distinct standards of morality which may in some particular\\n', 'coincide in their content, so that what counts as a virtuous or a vicious act according to the\\n', 'one may similarly so count as the other. Locke may, however, be read somewhat differently, as\\n', 'concerned with how persons see the precepts of morality. Those who assess their actions in\\n', 'terms of the law of reputation see these precepts as what is socially approved or disapproved,\\n', 'and share society’s approval or disapproval. Those who assess them in terms of the divine law\\n', 'see moral precepts as the law of God. The heathen philosopher perceives morality in the\\n', 'former of these ways, the Christian in the latter.\\n', '\\n', '(Colman, 2003: 123)\\n', 'The reason why the two judgments will not vary so much is that “nothing can be more\\n', 'rational, than to encourage with Esteem and Reputation that, wherein every one finds\\n', 'his Advantage; and to blame and discountenance the contrary” (II.xxviii.11). To see\\n', '\\n', ' CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', 'virtue and vice as not confined to the following of laws of reputation, therefore, is fully\\n', 'consistent with Locke’s understanding of it. I am also very sympathetic to the view\\n', 'that, for Locke, a virtuous life is one lived according to reason. Not that I would equate\\n', 'virtue with rationality, but certainly rationality is a virtue that leads to happiness\\n', 'rather than misery. Rationality allows us to determine which actions are commen-\\n', 'surate with law and which are not.\\n', '\\n', 'To return to the analogy Locke seems to be drawing, just as we need to preserve\\n', 'ourselves physically here and now with, say, food and water, we need to preserve ourselves\\n', 'in the longer term (including in an afterlife) by pursuing virtue, which I take to be\\n', 'choosing those actions that bring the most happiness, those commensurate with law,\\n', 'and most importantly with divine law. Because Locke thinks that only the just are\\n', 'preserved in an afterlife, where the wicked are extinguished, we can also see the\\n', 'analogy in this way: Just as we are naturally driven to avoid present bodily deterior-\\n', 'ation and premature death, we also are naturally driven to avoid longer-term pains\\n', 'and punishments and eventual annihilation.8 So, in both cases, were we not motivated\\n', 'to that which preserves us, we would not be in a position to attain happiness, which “in\\n', 'its full extent,” Locke explains, “is the utmost Pleasure we are capable of ” (II.xxi.42).\\n', '\\n', 'But for the analogy to go through there must be a natural motivation to choose a\\n', 'greater good leading to most happiness (perhaps even in an afterlife), just as there is a\\n', 'natural motivation to choose what leads to continued physical health.\\n', '\\n', 'In his arguments against innate practical knowledge, Locke admits that we do have\\n', 'one innate action-guiding principle: “Nature, I confess, has put into Man a desire for\\n', 'Happiness, and an aversion to Misery: These indeed are innate practical Principles,\\n', 'which (as practical Principles ought) do continue to operate and influence all our\\n', 'Actions without ceasing” (I.iii.3). That we are so naturally motivated in the direction\\n', 'of longer-term (future) happiness is suggested in the next passage:\\n', 'Beyond all this [pains naturally annexed to objects dangerous to our bodily preservation], we\\n', 'may find another reason why God hath scattered up and down several degrees of Pleasure and\\n', 'Pain, in all the things that environ and affect us; and blended them together, in almost all that\\n', 'our Thoughts and Senses have to do with; that we finding imperfection, dissatisfaction, and\\n', 'want of complete happiness, in all the Enjoyments which the Creatures can afford us, might be\\n', 'led to seek it in the enjoyment of him, with whom there is fullness of joy, and at whose right\\n', 'hand are the pleasures for evermore.\\n', '\\n', '(II.vii.5)\\n', '8 Locke (2002: 234) argues that it is more consistent with scripture that only the just are resurrected to everlasting life, where as the wicked receive death. Indeed, Locke thinks it is a convenient fiction to think that the wicked enjoy an afterlife, even one filled with torment and misery. He says, “The constant language of Scripture in the whole current of the new testament as well as the old is life to the just, to believers, to the obedient; & death to the wicked and unbelievers that one would wonder how the readers could be mistaken when death is threatened soe constantly & declared every where to be the ultimate punishment & last estate to which the wicked must all come. To salve this they have invented a very odd signification of the word death which they would have stand for eternal life in torment.” I thank Jessica Gordon-Roth for pushing me to think more about this work of Locke’s.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', '\\n', 'Here Locke seems to say that one reason God has seen fit to blend pleasures and\\n', 'pains with all those things that affect us is so that we will experience the dissatisfac-\\n', 'tion (or feeling of uneasiness) that comes from the happiness we are still missing.\\n', '\\n', 'Thus, we are created such that not only are we always naturally seeking the happiness\\n', 'that comes from the preservation of our lives here and now, but also we are naturally\\n', 'seeking to attain “complete” happiness culminating in our preservation with God in\\n', 'the next life, “with whom there is fullness of joy, and at whose right hand are the\\n', 'pleasures for evermore.” Therefore, Locke seems to think we are created such that we\\n', 'have a natural motivation to pursue those goods leading to longer-term “complete”\\n', 'happiness.9\\n', '5.2 Motivation to Pursue Greater Goods\\n', 'To understand the nature of our motivation to pursue “complete” (II.vii.5), “true”\\n', '(II.xxi.53), or “real” (II.xxi.51) happiness, we will need to back up a minute to see\\n', 'whether we can, and if so how we can, pursue a greater good, say, one that leads to\\n', 'greater pleasure in the longer term. Let us begin with Locke’s account of motivation\\n', 'generally. With respect to any good, greater or not, “I am sure,” says Locke, “where-\\n', 'ever there is uneasiness there is desire: For we constantly desire happiness; and\\n', 'whatever we feel of uneasiness, so much, ’tis certain, we want of happiness”\\n', '(II.xxi.39).10 So, happiness (in its full extent the utmost pleasure) is the removal of\\n', 'pain or uneasiness and what we desire most and constantly.11\\n', 'Locke also thinks, as mentioned above, that we are always looking to continue\\n', 'whatever pleasure we currently enjoy.\\n', '\\n', 'Besides, the present moment not being our eternity, whatever our enjoyment be, we look\\n', 'beyond the present, and desire goes with our foresight, and that still carries the will with it. So that even in joy it self, that which keeps up the action, whereon the enjoyment depends, is the\\n', 'desire to continue it, and fear to lose it.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.39)\\n', 'A pleasure lost is experienced as pain. Therefore, we are moved to will an action that\\n', 'continues our pleasure as long as the pleasure lasts, which is either its complete\\n', 'duration or just as long as our attention is not drawn away by an interfering pain. For\\n', 'example, I will continue eating the chocolate cake in front of me until it is gone or\\n', 'until I feel the pain of a full stomach, a pang of guilt, or some other intervening\\n', 'uneasiness. Consistent with my “desire following my foresight,” I may even begin to\\n', '9 Locke continues in II.vii.6 by explaining that God’s annexation of pleasures and pains to particular things in different ways and degrees helps us along the path to achieving that which brings most happiness:\\n', '“the knowledge and veneration of Him, being the chief end of all of our Thoughts, and the proper business of all Understanding.”\\n', '10 See also II.xxi.43: “Happiness . . . every one constantly pursues, and desires what makes any part of it.”\\n', '11 “So the greatest Happiness consists, in having those things, which produce the greatest Pleasure; and in the absence of those, which cause any disturbance, any pain” (II.xxi.55).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', 'eat more slowly in order to extend my pleasure farther into the future (or, what is the\\n', 'same, put off the pain of having no more cake for as long as possible).\\n', '\\n', 'Locke continues his analysis by telling us that whatever brings pleasure is good and\\n', 'whatever brings pain is evil. But that does not mean that goods cannot be compared\\n', 'or measured against one another, such that a greater one wins out:\\n', 'Farther, though what is apt to produce any degree of Pleasure, be in it self good; and what is apt\\n', 'to produce any degree of Pain, be evil; yet it often happens, that we do not call it so, when it\\n', 'comes in competition with a greater of its sort; because when they come in competition the\\n', 'degrees also of Pleasure and Pain have justly a preference. So that if we will rightly estimate\\n', 'what we call Good and Evil, we shall find it lies much in comparison: For the cause of every less\\n', 'degree of Pain, as well as every greater degree of Pleasure has the nature of good, and vice versa.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.43)\\n', 'Indeed, when it comes to comparing the pleasures of competing goods, it makes a lot\\n', 'of difference what we are presently experiencing. Often what happens is that a\\n', 'present pain will easily trump the promise of a future pleasure, so that we have\\n', 'neither the time nor the inclination to pursue more goods or those other than what\\n', 'demands our immediate attention. If we spend most of our time working for food\\n', 'and shelter, namely avoiding the pains of hunger and cold, then we have not much\\n', 'time or interest to pursue other sorts of pleasures, say, those to be gained from more\\n', 'leisured activities.\\n', '\\n', 'And even if we are able to consider greater pleasures, we do not necessarily pursue\\n', 'them. “This, I think, any one may observe in himself, and others, that the greater\\n', 'visible good does not always raise Men’s desires in proportion to the greatness, it\\n', 'appears, and is acknowledged to have: Though every little trouble moves us, and sets\\n', 'us on work to get rid of it” (II.xxi.44). Because our happiness comes mostly from\\n', 'alleviating pain, and we are constantly bombarded with sundry pains of varying\\n', 'degrees, we are much too busy with those pains to generate equally forceful, or even\\n', 'at times any, desires for greater goods. “The reason whereof,” explains Locke, “is\\n', 'evident from the nature of our happiness and misery it self. All present pain, whatever\\n', 'it be, makes a part of our present misery: But all absent good does not at any time\\n', 'make a necessary part of our present happiness, nor the absence of it make a part of\\n', 'our misery” (II.xxi.44). Locke continues:\\n', 'We are seldom at ease, and free enough from the sollicitation of our natural or adopted desires,\\n', 'but a constant succession of uneasinesses out of that stock, which natural wants, or acquired\\n', 'habits have heaped up, take the will in their turns; and no sooner is one action dispatch’d,\\n', 'which by such a determination of the will we are set upon, but another uneasiness is ready to\\n', 'set us on work. For the removing of the pains we feel, and are at present pressed with, being the\\n', 'getting out of misery, and consequently the first thing to be done in order to happiness, absent\\n', 'good, though thought on, confessed, and appearing to be good, not making any part of this\\n', 'unhappiness in its absence, is jostled out, to make way for the removal of those uneasinesses we\\n', '[currently] feel.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.45)\\n', '\\n', 'CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', '\\n', 'Extirpating present pains takes precedence over ensuring a future greater good, and\\n', 'since we cannot avoid the onslaught of present pains, whether natural bodily\\n', 'demands or acquired desires we have become accustomed to assuaging, we are in a\\n', 'sense not free to develop desires for future greater goods.\\n', '\\n', 'Furthermore, even though we all tend toward happiness, different people experi-\\n', 'ence pleasures differently, which means that happiness is not necessarily achieved by\\n', 'pursuing the same pleasures:\\n', 'The Mind has a different relish, as well as the Palate; and you will as fruitlessly endeavour to\\n', 'delight all Men with Riches or Glory, (which yet some Men place their Happiness in,) as you\\n', 'would satisfy all Men’s Hunger with Cheese or Lobsters; which, though very agreeable and\\n', 'delicious fare to some, are to others extremely nauseous and offensive.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.55)\\n', 'Thus, what pleasures strike us as greater depends on the idiosyncracies of our palates\\n', 'and on our present circumstances. As Locke says:\\n', 'This I think may serve to show us the Reason, why, though all Men’s desires tend to Happiness,\\n', 'yet they are not moved by the same Object. Men may chuse different things, and yet all chuse\\n', 'right, supposing them only like a Company of poor Insects, whereof some are Bees, delighted\\n', 'with Flowers, and their sweetness; others, Beetles, delighted with other kinds of Viands; which\\n', 'having enjoyed for a season, they should cease to be, and exist no more for ever.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.55)\\n', 'Locke is suggesting that although we are all moved toward that which individually\\n', 'brings pleasure, and all pleasure is good, we always choose correctly which good to\\n', 'pursue only “supposing we are a Company of poor Insects.” I take this to mean that\\n', 'one difference between insects and us is that we do not always choose correctly, even\\n', 'if we attain the pleasure we desire. Under the supposition that we are not insects, we\\n', 'are able to compare goods in terms of the pleasures they promise instead of flitting\\n', 'from one to another depending on what delights us in the moment. Thus, we are able\\n', 'to pursue greater goods. How are we able to do that?\\n', '\\n', 'To start, Locke distinguishes present apparent happiness from true or real\\n', 'happiness:\\n', 'But the forbearance of a too hasty compliance with our desires, the moderation and restraint of\\n', 'our Passions, so that our Understandings may be free to examine, and reason unbiased give its\\n', 'judgment, being that, whereon a right direction of our conduct to true Happiness depends; ’tis\\n', 'in this we should employ our chief care and endeavours. In this we should take pains to suit the\\n', 'relish of our Minds to the true intrinsick good or ill, that is in things; and not permit an allow’d or supposed possible great and weighty good to slip out of our thoughts, without leaving any\\n', 'relish, any desire of it self there, till, by due consideration of its true worth, we have formed\\n', 'appetites in our Minds suitable to it.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.53)\\n', 'First, there is a “true intrinsic good or ill” to be gained from pursuing particular\\n', 'things, which is distinguished from what is only apparently good or ill. Second,\\n', '“taking care” to make sure our actions comply with an unbiased judgment of what is\\n', 'truly good or ill puts us in the direction of “true Happiness.” Third, thinking about a\\n', '\\n', ' CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', '“great and weighty [true] good” can result in a “relish” or desire for that good where\\n', 'no desire previously existed. And fourth, if we “take pains” to work at it, we have the\\n', 'ability to “suit our Minds” to relish or desire that which has “true worth” over that\\n', 'which presents itself as only appearing so. Hence, even though what brings us\\n', 'pleasure is up to us, and what brings pleasure is good, Locke still thinks some\\n', 'pleasures have “true worth” where others do not.\\n', '\\n', 'I suggest that we can see pleasures having true worth as those best ensuring the\\n', 'greatest happiness, which is achieved in two ways. First, insofar as we are beings who feel\\n', 'immediate pleasures and pains, we can achieve happiness by doing that which ensures\\n', 'our physical preservation here and now. Second, insofar as we are beings interested in\\n', 'longer-term pleasures and pains, we can achieve happiness by doing that which really\\n', 'does bring the most pleasure in the longer term. And because we are able to weigh\\n', 'competing pleasures (we are not a company of insects), we are able to will actions that\\n', 'result in pleasures having true worth. Locke seems to confirm as much here:\\n', 'To him, I say, who hath a prospect of the different state of perfect Happiness or Misery, that\\n', 'attends all Men after this Life, depending on their Behaviour here, the measures of Good and\\n', 'Evil, that govern his choice, are mightily changed. For since nothing of Pleasure and Pain in\\n', 'this Life, can bear any proportion to endless Happiness, or exquisite Misery of an immortal\\n', 'Soul hereafter, Actions in his Power will have their preference, not in according to transient\\n', 'Pleasure, or Pain that accompanies, or follows them here; but as they serve to secure that\\n', 'perfect durable Happiness hereafter.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.60)\\n', 'And even though having the most pleasure, ultimately, will come from the eternal\\n', 'happiness in our preservation in an afterlife, all of our actions can be considered in\\n', 'light of whether or not they conduce to bringing about the most pleasure. That is, all\\n', 'of our actions can be considered insofar as they bring true happiness, even though\\n', 'what we choose would make no difference to our eternal reward.\\n', '\\n', 'Why, then, do we not always will what brings true happiness when the choice does\\n', 'make a difference? Locke admits that the mere thought of eternal happiness should\\n', 'move us to do whatever we can in pursuit of it:\\n', 'Were the will determin’d by the views of the good, . . . I do not see how it could ever get loose\\n', 'from the infinite eternal joys of Heaven, once propose’d and consider’d as possible.

Locke admits that even\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', '\\n', 'when we recognize the possibility of eternal happiness we often do not choose it.\\n', '\\n', 'Experience teaches us that we neglect eternal goods in order to satisfy the successive\\n', 'pains of our desires after “trifles.”12 Indeed, sometimes we experience such severe and\\n', 'constant uneasiness that we are not able even to consider other goods:\\n', 'Thus any vehement pain of the Body; the ungovernable passion of a Man violently in love; or\\n', 'the impatient desire of revenge, keeps the will steady and intent; and the will thus determined\\n', 'never lets the Understanding lay by the object, but all the thoughts of the Mind, and powers of\\n', 'the Body are uninterruptedly employ’d that way, but the determinations of the will, influenced\\n', 'by that topping uneasiness, as long as it lasts; whereby it seems to me evident, that the will, or\\n', 'power of setting us upon one action in preference to all other, is determin’d in us, by\\n', 'uneasiness: and whether this be not so, I desire every one to observe in himself.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.38)\\n', 'Therefore, the goods themselves do not determine the will.

From these kinds of\\n', 'experiences, Locke concludes that only the pain generated from not having some-\\n', 'thing we want, that is, a desire for it, causes us to will an action toward the attaining\\n', 'of that perceived good. Therefore, only the pain generated from not having true\\n', 'happiness, namely a desire for it, can move the will to actions attaining it.\\n', '\\n', 'On the analogy suggested by Locke earlier, just as there is a natural motivation\\n', 'pushing us in the direction of present preservation (happiness), there must be a\\n', 'natural motivation pushing us in the direction of long-term preservation (happi-\\n', 'ness). A desire for true happiness must be able to present itself to us such that even if\\n', 'we are presently content or in the throes of a violent passion, it changes the course of\\n', 'our direction toward the happiness that comes with long-term preservation, just as a\\n', 'desire for food and water changes our direction toward our present preservation.\\n', '\\n', 'This desire for true happiness must be able to break into the stream of natural and\\n', 'habitual desires, such that it can compete with them and perhaps win with respect to\\n', 'them.

Interruption of the ongoing chain of desires\\n', 'in order that the will is redirected to a greater good is referred to as Locke’s “suspension\\n', 'of desire thesis.” It is also necessary for Locke’s second sense of liberty—the freedom to\\n', 'act as the result of rational deliberation.13\\n', 'Liberty, Locke initially defines as “the power a Man has to do or forbear doing any\\n', 'particular Action, according as its doing or forbearance has the actual preference in\\n', 'the Mind, which is the same thing as to say, according, as he himself wills it”\\n', '(II.xxi.15). This first sense of liberty is the ability to act or not act in accordance\\n', 'with what we will. But if we are motivated by desire, and desires are raised in us\\n', 'proportionate to the uneasiness we feel in any particular moment, and yet we are able\\n', 'to compare and pursue greater goods, then Locke must have an account of how we\\n', 'are able to resist the force of a present desire. Only so are we able to break into the\\n', 'stream of desires in order to assess rationally what we are about to do, that is, have\\n', 'the second sense of liberty. Moreover, our choices are free enough for moral agency\\n', 'because we are able to step back from a present pressing desire in order to examine\\n', 'rationally how much pleasure is to be gained from a particular action as compared\\n', 'with other actions, namely to figure out which action has “true worth”:\\n', 'There being a great many uneasinesses always solliciting, and ready to determine the will, it is\\n', 'natural, as I have said, that the greatest, and most pressing should determine the will to the next action; and so it does for the most part, but not always. For the mind having in most cases, as is\\n', 'evident in Experience, a power to suspend the execution and satisfaction of any of its desires, and so all, one after another, is at liberty to consider the objects of them; examine them on all sides, and weigh them with others. In this lies the liberty a Man has; and from the not using it right comes all that variety of mistakes, errors, and faults which we run into, in the conduct of our lives, and our endeavours after happiness; whilst we precipitate the determination of our wills, and engage too\\n', 'soon before due Examination. To prevent this we have a power to suspend the prosecution of this\\n', 'or that desire, as every one daily may Experiment in himself. This seems to me the source of all\\n', 'liberty; in this seems to consist that, which is (as I think improperly) call’d Free will. For during this suspension of any desire, before the will be determined to action, and the action (which follows that determination) done, we have opportunity to examine, view, and judge, of the good or evil of what\\n', 'we are going to do; and when, upon due Examination, we have judg’d, we have done our duty, all\\n', 'that we can, or ought to do, in pursuit of our happiness; and ’tis not a fault, but a perfection\\n', 'of our nature to desire, will, and act according to the last result of a fair Examination.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.47)\\n', 'Engaging in the twofold process of suspending a desire and examining the relative\\n', 'pains and pleasures to be gained from alternative actions discharges our moral duty,\\n', '13 Darwall (1995: 51), Chappell (2000: 246–7), Yaffe (2000: 47, 59), Bolton (2008: 262), LoLordo (2012: 46), Walsh (2014: 139). Rickless (2013: 46) argues that suspension of desire is not a different sense of liberty, but rather “the power to suspend is just a special case of the liberty of action.” Although I am using similar language as the foregoing group, I do not see my argument as engaging this debate.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', '\\n', 'by helping to ensure that we are able to engage in actions that truly bring the most\\n', 'pleasure in the long run.\\n', '\\n', 'In Locke’s moral theory, actions resulting in the most pleasure are those commen-\\n', 'surate with law, whether divine, civil, or what Locke calls laws of reputation. Actions in\\n', 'accordance with the law avoid the pain of punishment, either by a civil or a divine\\n', 'authority or by one’s social peers. Moreover, good and evil, as we have seen, “are\\n', 'nothing but Pleasure or Pain, or that which occasions, or procures Pleasure or Pain to\\n', 'us.” Locke then distinguishes “Morally Good and Evil . . . [as] the Conformity or\\n', 'Disagreement of our voluntary Actions to some Law, whereby Good or Evil is drawn\\n', 'on us, for the Will and Power of the law-maker is that we call Reward and Punishment”\\n', '(II.xxviii.5). Laws, or what Locke also calls “Moral Rules” (II.xxviii.6), come in three\\n', 'sorts with three different kinds of enforcements, or rewards and punishments: “Divine\\n', 'law,” which is enforced by God (II.xxviii.8); “Civil law,” which is enforced by the\\n', 'commonwealth (II.xxviii.9), and the “Law of Opinion or Reputation,” namely the law\\n', 'of virtue and vice, which is enforced by the condemnation, contempt, and disgrace of\\n', 'one’s companions (II.xxviii.10, II.xxviii.12).

Insofar as our choices do not issue\\n', 'from our nature as “thinking, intelligent beings” who naturally desire what they judge\\n', 'best, “the nearer we are,” says Locke, “to Misery and Slavery” (II.xxi.48).

Yaffe (2000: 58) argues that what\\n', 'grounds a full-fledged sense of liberty, liberty that goes beyond actions in accordance\\n', 'with the will, is that we are strongly tied to the pursuit of the good, a non-agent relative\\n', 'good, such that our choices are determined by that good. Suspension of desire and a\\n', 'rational assessment of the happiness to be achieved in any action are “on occasion, the\\n', 'only way for an agent to bring it about that her volitions are determined by the good.\\n', '\\n', 'But it is the having of such strong ties that is the ‘foundation of our liberty’ [II.xxi.51]:\\n', 'it is what there is to liberty, true liberty, beyond the freedom of action.” Being “tied” to\\n', 'the good, which Yaffe (2000: 57) also describes as our volitions “tracking the good\\n', 'wherever it lies,” is to choose the right action—the one leading to the most happiness.\\n', '\\n', 'Moreover, Yaffe (2000: 118) describes this form of liberty as a perfection. He says,\\n', '“Determination of choice by the good is a perfection in the determination of choice.”\\n', 'I take it that when our choices are determined by the good, we are achieving perfection\\n', 'in our choice-making. Notice, though, that Yaffe is interpreting Locke’s understanding\\n', '\\n', ' CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', 'of the perfection attained as one in making the right kinds of choices—choices that\\n', 'attain the good. Yaffe (2000: 118) concludes that true liberty, or freedom, for Locke, is\\n', 'a form of self-transcendence. Because our choices are determined by the good, or at\\n', 'least we have the ability to have them determined by the good, we are able to rise above\\n', 'ourselves by “escaping our own parochialisms and biases.” So, it seems that the\\n', 'perfection of our nature as Locke seems to be describing it above is the making of,\\n', 'or the ability to make, choices that track the good as opposed to those that are perhaps\\n', 'influenced by other considerations.\\n', '\\n', 'In objection to Yaffe’s interpretation, LoLordo (2012: 53) argues that if God\\n', 'wanted our desires to accord with the good, there are “far more efficient ways to\\n', 'ensure this than by giving us the power to suspend and deliberate.” LoLordo (2012:\\n', '51–2) argues against Yaffe’s understanding of free agency as self-transcendence, for it\\n', 'puts too much emphasis on the pursuit of a transcendent good as opposed to our\\n', 'own self-interest. Locke is clear that what we seek is happiness, which is to be\\n', 'achieved by the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. Pleasures and pains\\n', 'are what motivate voluntary action. So suspension of desire is in the service of\\n', 'gaining more pleasure and less pain in the long run, which seems not to be so\\n', 'much self-transcendence as it is self-determination. LoLordo (2012: 53) concludes\\n', 'that the value of suspension and deliberation for Locke’s account of free agency is not\\n', 'that it culminates in choices tied to the good, but rather in that it allows us to\\n', 'determine ourselves: “suspension is valuable because of the way it helps us to modify\\n', 'our desires, not because the desires we end up with after suspending track the good.”\\n', 'As my arguments so far have and will continue to bear out, I suspect it is fairly obvious\\n', 'that I would agree that Locke’s account of moral agency in the second edition of the Essay\\n', 'is more about self-determination than it is about self-transcendence. Indeed, I argue that\\n', 'what is most important about self-determination in moral agency is that it is rational self-\\n', 'determination. But I am sympathetic to one very important aspect of Yaffe’s view. I also\\n', 'argue that there is a value of suspension for our perfection, but for me it is the perfection\\n', 'of our nature as intellectual (rational) beings “to desire, will, and act according to the last\\n', 'result of a fair Examination” (II.xxi.47). Achieving that perfection, however, is not tied to\\n', 'transcending my human nature, by having my choices tied to the good, but to the best\\n', 'expression of my nature as an intellectual being in attaining the most pleasure possible—\\n', 'true happiness in the longer term, including in an afterlife.\\n', '\\n', 'I think Locke’s account of liberty, therefore, can be seen as grounding an ethics of\\n', 'naturalism in two parts.14 First, insofar as we are thinking intelligent beings, namely rational\\n', 'beings, it is a perfection of our nature that reason plays a significant role in determining\\n', '14 By “ethics of naturalism” I do not mean the contemporary view that nothing exists that is not natural, nor am I trying to equate what I see in Locke with any particular contemporary ethical theory. Rather, I simply mean that, for Locke, there is a correlation between how we are naturally, the kind of beings we are, and what we ought to do, such that the best expression of the former results in moral action, that is, actions commensurate with laws, which lead to greater happiness in the long term (to the avoidance of civil and divine punishment). See Darwall (1995) and Flage (2000) for other similar attributions.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', '\\n', 'our actions. Reason not only tells us the best way to achieve happiness, but can also raise a\\n', 'desire to will an action proportionate to the assessment of what brings happiness. Locke\\n', 'says, “And therefore every Man is put under a necessity by his constitution, as an intelligent\\n', 'Being, to be determined in willing by his own Thought and Judgment, what is best for him to\\n', 'do” (II.xxi.48).15 But even though a judgment can raise a desire, unless desire is suspended\\n', 'already, we are too taken up with meeting our desires for a second-order judgment about\\n', 'our desires to intervene. That just is why Locke must include the suspension of desire in his\\n', 'account of moral agency—to make enough room for reason to have a role to play.16\\n', 'Second, although reason can trigger desire, it does not of itself determine the will.\\n', '\\n', 'Only desire motivates. Therefore, for Locke’s twofold account of our duty as intel-\\n', 'ligent agents (the suspension of desire and rational deliberation) to succeed,17 there\\n', 'must be another mechanism by which the will is determined to suspend desire. Our\\n', 'natural innate drive toward happiness (the innate practical principle) is insufficient\\n', 'to motivate the suspension of desire, for, as Locke says, it operates “constantly . . . and\\n', 'influences all our Actions without ceasing” (I.iii.3). Yet clearly we do not always\\n', 'suspend desire in order to deliberate about our actions; we do not always succeed in\\n', 'doing our duty. Suspension of desire, therefore, requires something more.\\n', '\\n', 'Interpreting Locke’s account of the motivation necessary for suspension requires\\n', 'that we make explicit what Locke, in this next passage, leaves relatively implicit:\\n', 'As therefore the highest perfection of intellectual nature, lies in a careful and constant pursuit\\n', 'of true and solid happiness; so the care of our selves, that we mistake not imaginary for real\\n', 'happiness, is the necessary foundation of our liberty. The stronger ties, we have, to an\\n', 'unalterable pursuit of happiness in general, which is our greatest good, and which as such\\n', 'our desires always follow, the more we are free from any necessary determination of our will to\\n', 'any particular action, and from a necessary compliance with our desire, set upon any\\n', 'particular, and then appearing any preferable good, till we have duly examin’d, whether it\\n', 'has a tendency to, or be inconsistent with our real happiness; and therefore till we are as much\\n', 'inform’d upon this enquiry, as the weight of the matter, and the nature of the case demands, we\\n', 'are by the necessity of preferring and pursuing true happiness as our greatest good, obliged to\\n', 'suspend the satisfaction of our desire in particular cases.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.51)\\n', '15 Following Chappell (2000: 247), I read Locke as meaning that this “Thought and Judgment” comes\\n', 'after a rational examination.\\n', '\\n', '16 It is uncontroversial, I think, that Locke sees the suspension of desire and deliberation as necessary to discharging our moral duty and so assuming moral responsibility: “And here we may see how it comes to pass, that a Man may justly incur punishment. . . . If neglect or abuse of the Liberty he had, to examine what would really and truly make for his Happiness, misleads him, the miscarriages that follow upon it, must be imputed to his own election. He had a Power to suspend his determination: It was given him, that he might examine, and take care of his own Happiness, and look that he were not deceived. And he could never judge, that it was better to be deceived, than not, in a matter of so great and near concernment” (II.xxi.56).\\n', '\\n', 'Locke’s use of “concernment” in this last sentence, of course, refers to the concern we have for our own true happiness.\\n', '\\n', '17 Bolton (2008: 264, n 31) argues that the duty of rational inquiry is a cognitive duty that “has a nonmoral ground.” Although she does not see it this way, she admits that it “is not inconsistent with the view that it is also a moral duty.”\\n', '\\n', ' CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', 'The difficulty and importance of this passage warrant a careful look. Locke tells us\\n', 'that the highest perfection of our intellectual nature “lies in a careful and constant\\n', 'pursuit of true happiness.” From previous passages, we know that pursuit of “real” or\\n', '“true” happiness is the pursuit of long-term happiness ending ultimately in eternal\\n', 'happiness in an afterlife. In the consideration of any particular good we can make\\n', 'sure that that good is consistent with gaining true happiness.18 Moreover, Locke says\\n', 'that part of our natural pursuit of true happiness is the “care of ourselves” that we\\n', 'mistake not imaginary for real happiness, and this is the “necessary foundation of our\\n', 'liberty.” I take Locke to mean that we have a natural concern for ourselves that we\\n', 'attain true happiness.19 Not to mistake apparent for true happiness is to avoid a\\n', 'determination of the will to an action that we have not yet assessed insofar as it\\n', 'actually does bring true happiness. Therefore, the natural concern for our own true\\n', 'happiness is essential to the suspension of desire. Furthermore, in glossing the “care of\\n', 'our selves” that we pursue true happiness, Locke explains that the “stronger our ties”\\n', 'to the pursuit of “happiness in general, which is our greatest good . . . the more we are\\n', 'free from any necessary determination of our will to any particular action.” Here,\\n', 'Locke explains that the greater our concern for our happiness generally, the greater\\n', 'the impulse toward rational deliberation, and so the freer we are from necessary\\n', 'determination by any particular desire. Constitutive of the highest perfection of an\\n', 'intellectual nature, therefore, is a natural concern for ourselves that the happiness to\\n', 'which we are innately driven is true as opposed to merely apparent happiness. That\\n', 'Locke sees the innate practical principle (the desire for happiness generally) as\\n', 'insufficient on its own for suspension is further confirmed in this passage:\\n', 'But though this general Desire of Happiness operates constantly and invariably, yet the satisfac-\\n', 'tion of any particular desire can be suspended from determining the will to any subservient action, till we have maturely examin’d, whether the particular apparent good, which we then desire,\\n', 'makes a part of our real Happiness, or be consistent or inconsistent with it.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.71)\\n', 'If the general desire for happiness operates constantly, and yet any particular desire\\n', 'can be suspended, then clearly Locke must think that something more than the\\n', '18 If we have paid attention to religious education, understood and accepted its principles, Locke thinks we will choose eternal happiness over the pleasure promised by any other perceived good: “Change but a Man’s view of these things; let him see, that Virtue and Religion are necessary to his Happiness; let him look into the future State of Bliss or Misery, and see there God the righteous Judge, ready to render to every man according to his Deeds; . . . To him, I say, who hath a prospect of the different State of perfect Happiness or Misery, that attends all Men after this Life, depending on their behaviour here, the measures of Good and Evil, that govern his choice are mightily changed. For since nothing of pleasure and pain in this Life, can bear any proportion to endless Happiness, or exquisite Misery of an immortal Soul hereafter, Actions in his Power will have their preference, not according to the transient Pleasure, or Pain that accompanies, or follows them here; but as they serve to secure that perfect durable Happiness hereafter”\\n', '(II.xxi.60).\\n', '\\n', '19 In the Conduct of the Understanding, Locke (1996/1706: 182) says, “Besides his particular calling for the support of this life, everyone has a concern in a future life, which he is bound to look after.

For\\n', 'surely Locke realizes that he cannot have it both ways. That something more, constitutive\\n', 'of the highest perfection of an intellectual nature, is the concern for ourselves that we\\n', 'attain true happiness.20\\n', 'Then, in this next passage, Locke ties our concern for true happiness to our ability\\n', 'to suspend desire. Indeed, our concern that we attain true happiness leads to the\\n', 'suspension of desire and rational deliberation:\\n', 'This is the hinge on which turns the liberty of intellectual beings in their constant endeavours\\n', 'after, and a steady prosecution of true felicity, that they can suspend this prosecution in\\n', 'particular cases, till they have looked before them, and informed themselves, whether that\\n', 'particular thing, which is then proposed, or desired, lie in the way to their main end, and make\\n', 'a real part of that which is their greatest good. For the inclination and tendency of their nature\\n', 'to happiness is an obligation, and motive to them, to take care not to miss it; and so necessarily\\n', 'puts them on caution, deliberation, and wariness, in the direction of their particular actions,\\n', 'which are the means to obtain it. Whatever necessity determines to the pursuit of real Bliss, the\\n', 'same necessity, with the same force establishes suspence, deliberation, and scrutiny of each\\n', 'successive desire, whether the satisfaction of it, does not interfere with our true happiness, and\\n', 'mislead us from it.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.52)\\n', 'True felicity is a life with no uneasiness; it is our greatest good. It can be no other than\\n', 'eternal bliss, the eternal happiness of an afterlife.21 And even though we have a natural\\n', 'inclination to our own happiness generally, which gives us an “obligation” and a\\n', '“motive” to attain happiness by the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain, still\\n', 'we have to “take care” that we do not miss an opportunity for true happiness.22 I read\\n', 'Locke’s use of “to take care” in making sure that whatever pleasure we are driven\\n', 'toward makes a part of our “real” happiness as equivalent to having a “concern for true\\n', 'happiness.” That is, if I am taking care not to miss an opportunity for true happiness\\n', 'when I am confronted with a particular desire, then I must be concerned that whatever\\n', 'appears as bringing happiness really and truly does bring happiness—in the longer\\n', 'term. Locke then adds, “Whatever necessity determines to the pursuit of real Bliss, the\\n', 'same necessity, with the same force establishes suspence, deliberation, and scrutiny\\n', 'of each successive desire” (II.xxi.52). Locke says much the same thing in II.xxi.51: “we\\n', '20 To my knowledge, no one writing about this issue in Locke has recognized that something beyond the general desire for happiness is needed to motivate suspension. Bolton (2008), although not specifically addressing this issue, might be an exception. Walsh (2014) would be an outlier in that her account of suspension does not mention, at least explicitly, the general desire for happiness at all.\\n', '\\n', '21 Locke must be equating eternal happiness with true felicity, since the utmost happiness just is a life in which we have no uneasiness, a life in which we have no desire, since all the goods/pleasures we can imagine are already attained. It seems impossible that we, as bodily beings, can have a natural life without uneasiness. We will necessarily feels the pangs of hunger or other bodily discomforts.\\n', '\\n', '22 Interestingly, Hobbes (1994: xi.1, 57) defines felicity as “a continual progress of the desire, from one object to another, the attaining of the former being still but the way to the latter. The cause whereof is that the object of man’s desire is not to enjoy once only, and for one instant of time, but to assure forever the way of his future desire.”\\n', '\\n', ' CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', 'are by the necessity of preferring and pursuing true happiness as our greatest good,\\n', 'obliged to suspend the satisfaction of our desire in particular cases.” Locke seems to be\\n', 'distinguishing true happiness from happiness generally. And whatever drives us to\\n', 'true as opposed to happiness generally is what also drives us to suspend desire.\\n', '\\n', 'So even though we are always driven toward our happiness generally—toward\\n', 'pleasure and away from pain—it is something more, an additional concern, or motiv-\\n', 'ation, that puts us in the direction of true happiness. Since it is the same force that moves\\n', 'us to true happiness (real Bliss) as moves us to suspend desire and deliberate about our\\n', 'actions, Locke must mean that the concern we have that the happiness we achieve is true\\n', 'happiness, or true felicity, is necessary to the suspension of desire. And the greater our\\n', 'concern for true happiness, that is, the greater our concern that whatever we are\\n', 'naturally driven toward leads to true happiness, the more we succeed in suspending a\\n', 'particular desire to assess its potential for true happiness.\\n', '\\n', 'What is more, because the alleviation of any pain results in pleasure, the concern\\n', 'to attain the most pleasure possible (true happiness) leads to the possibility of\\n', 'pursuing something that brings more pleasure, namely to the suspension of desire,\\n', 'regardless of whether after we have suspended desire we end up choosing what in fact\\n', 'promises the most pleasure. To sum up, insofar as we are beings with an intellectual\\n', 'nature, there is a natural concern for ourselves that reason is given its proper role to\\n', 'play in determining action even if the results of a rational deliberation are not\\n', 'without error. Suspension of desire creates the space for rational deliberation to\\n', 'occur. Working in tandem with our natural drive to happiness generally (the innate\\n', 'natural tendency to pleasure and away from pain imprinted in us from birth (I.iii.3)),\\n', 'is the additional concern for ourselves that we attain the kind (and degree) of\\n', 'happiness suitable to an intellectual nature—true happiness. Only when this add-\\n', 'itional concern for ourselves triggers the will to suspend desire are we in the right\\n', 'position to achieve our natural perfection.\\n', '\\n', 'Note that I am interpreting Locke’s use of “concern” here in a somewhat technical\\n', 'sense. When it is found in conjunction with happiness, Locke sometimes seems to\\n', 'have given it a more precise meaning: “concern” denotes a natural motivation toward\\n', 'true happiness, namely the uneasiness or pain of its absence. Let me draw attention to\\n', 'one passage where Locke seems explicitly to understand “concern” as equivalent to\\n', 'motivation. In II.xxi.43, when explaining that we can acknowledge a good without\\n', 'having a desire to pursue it, he says the following:\\n', 'Thus, how much soever Men are in earnest, and constant in pursuit of happiness; yet they may\\n', 'have a clear view of good, great and confessed good, without being concern’d for it, or moved\\n', 'by it, if they think they can make up their happiness without it. Though, as to pain, that they\\n', 'are always concern’d for; they can feel no uneasiness without being moved. (II.xxi.43)\\n', 'Here, Locke uses an appositive “or” to express that being “concern’d for” a good is the\\n', 'same as being “moved by it.” I take Locke to mean that I am concerned for, or moved\\n', 'by the pain or uneasiness of something’s absence. Moreover, we can fail to be\\n', '\\n', 'CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', '\\n', 'concerned to pursue something that is not perceived as contributing to our happi-\\n', 'ness, but we cannot fail to be concerned for (or moved by) something that causes\\n', 'pain. Any pain (or uneasiness) automatically, as the result of the way we are naturally\\n', 'constructed, generates a desire; we are moved to alleviate it. Given all the previous\\n', 'arguments in addition to this passage, there is good justification for concluding that\\n', 'Locke sees concern for ourselves that we attain true happiness (the pain of not having\\n', 'it) as having motivational force.23\\n', 'It is, of course, true that when Locke uses the term “concern” or “concernment” in the\\n', 'Essay it does not always carry this more technical meaning, and in these cases it is not\\n', 'meant to designate a motivation to suspend desire. This might be a good reason why\\n', 'Strawson (2011) interprets Locke’s use of concern in every case as merely having\\n', 'interests.24 One distinction I think we can make, though, is between interests for\\n', 'which it makes sense to be concerned about the true as opposed to the apparent\\n', 'happiness to be gained. For example, we find Locke using “concern” and “concernment”\\n', 'quite a lot in his II.xxvii chapter on personal identity. In II.xxvii.25, he tells us that “every\\n', 'intelligent being, sensible of Happiness and Misery, must grant, that there is something\\n', 'that is himself, that he is concerned for, and would have happy.” In II.xxvii.16, he says, “I\\n', 'being as much concern’d and as justly accountable for any Action was done a thousand\\n', 'Years since, appropriated to me now by this self-consciousness, as I am, for what I did in\\n', 'the last moment.”25 In the first passage, I am concerned for myself merely insofar as\\n', 'I suffer pleasures and pains; in the second, I am concerned for myself insofar as I am\\n', 'accountable for past actions. We see the same thing in Locke’s use of “concern” in his\\n', 'remarks about the certainty of sensitive knowledge (IV.ii.14, IV.xi.8). There he assures\\n', 'us that our degree of certainty is sufficient for our concerns, for our practical needs.\\n', '\\n', 'In each of the above cases, my happiness does not at all depend on drawing a\\n', 'distinction between true and apparent happiness. For example, I need not be worried\\n', 'that I cannot know whether a global skeptical scenario obtains, for as I have argued,\\n', 'I will feel the same pains or pleasures as the result of my sensory experiences\\n', 'regardless of whether or not they are actually produced by really existing external\\n', 'objects. In the II.xxvii.16 example from the chapter on personal identity, my concern\\n', 'is for myself insofar as I must suffer the consequences of an action I have already\\n', 'committed and so a rational assessment of its true value is pointless.

The difference here is that reason can play a role in whether or not\\n', 'I attain true happiness. But for reason to be effective, we must be able to suspend\\n', 'desire. So it makes sense that Locke’s use of “concern” for true happiness with respect\\n', 'to motivating suspension is different from his use of it in other places. Locke sees\\n', 'concern for ourselves that we attain true happiness as responsible for moving the will\\n', 'to suspend desire so that reason plays its proper role in determining our actions.27\\n', 'We now have very good reasons to draw the following two conclusions. First,\\n', 'when it comes to the true happiness to be gained from future actions, Locke seems to\\n', 'be using “concern” more technically to refer to a natural motivation resulting in the\\n', 'suspension of desire. That concern for true happiness plays this role in Locke’s\\n', 'account of moral motivation answers an important question. If the natural inclin-\\n', 'ation to happiness is constantly operative, then why do we sometimes fail to suspend\\n', 'our desires? Although the innate inclination to happiness may give us a reason and a\\n', 'motive to suspend, there is more to the motivational story for beings capable of\\n', 'rational, and, so also, moral agency. The concern for our own true happiness—a\\n', 'natural motivation toward the perfection of our nature as intellectual beings—is also\\n', 'operative. It provides the additional motivation making sure that reason plays the\\n', 'role it is supposed to play in our natural pursuit of happiness. One can, of course, still\\n', 'ask why we do not suspend all of the time, namely why we fail to suspend desire and\\n', 'why some people succeed in suspending more often than others? I will address these\\n', 'questions in the next section.\\n', '\\n', 'Second, just as we are naturally interrupted by the pain of not having what we need\\n', '(food and water) to ensure our physical preservation here and now, we are naturally\\n', 'interrupted by the pain of not having what we need (suspension of desire and\\n', 'rationally informed choices) to ensure our long-term preservation in this life and,\\n', 'perhaps, even in an afterlife. Insofar as we are beings capable of pleasure and pain, we\\n', 'have a constant and abiding natural inclination toward pleasure and away from pain:\\n', 'We are moved toward our happiness generally. Insofar as we are beings capable of\\n', 'rational deliberation, we have an additional capacity—a natural concern to make sure\\n', 'that the pleasures and pains we pursue and avoid contribute to our true (long-term)\\n', 'happiness. The effect of this latter motivation is the ability to suspend desire so that\\n', 'the perfection of an intellectual nature—the rational consideration of an action\\n', 'insofar as it promises true happiness—is achieved. Having a natural concern for\\n', 'ourselves that our happiness is true happiness, therefore, underwrites Locke’s\\n', 'account of the liberty necessary for moral agency.\\n', '\\n', '27 Bolton (2008: 262) puts it this way: “One is constantly moved by attractions and aversions of the moment, but Locke also supposes that such appetites co-exist with desires for future happiness and\\n', 'aversion to future misery. Such future-regarding desires give humans a natural motive to deploy reasoning in the pursuit of pleasure.” In addition to the arguments in her paper, I am grateful to Martha Bolton for her additional help in clarifying the role I see concern playing in Locke’s account.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', '\\n', 'In the next section, we will see that the concern for ourselves that we attain true\\n', 'happiness, which grounds the liberty constitutive of moral agency, is linked to the\\n', 'fact that we are self-conscious beings.\\n', '\\n', '5.4 Consciousness and the Concern for Happiness\\n', 'Locke himself links consciousness to the concern we have for our own happiness in\\n', 'the II.xxvii chapter, On Identity and Diversity.

But to be concerned for myself insofar as I am\\n', 'apt to feel pleasure and pain and am capable of happiness and misery requires that\\n', 'I have consciousness. It is not enough that I am a creature that senses pleasure and\\n', 'pain; I must also be aware of my pleasure and pain. Pleasures, pains, happiness, and\\n', 'misery would be nothing to me, were I not conscious of it.

Saying that I am happy or miserable\\n', 'if I am unable to experience happiness or misery is nonsensical.\\n', '\\n', 'Moreover, concern for happiness is not just due to the awareness of pleasure and\\n', 'pain—the capacity actually to feel pleasure and pain—but also that the pleasure and\\n', 'pain is experienced by me. Locke says:\\n', 'For as to this point of being the same self, it matters not whether this present self be made up of the same or other Substances, I being as much concern’d, . . . for any Action that was done a\\n', 'thousand years since, appropriated to me now by this self-consciousness, as I am, for what I did\\n', 'the last moment.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxvii.16)\\n', 'Regardless of whether the pleasure is in the distant past or occurred in the previous\\n', 'moment, I am concerned about it only insofar as the consciousness of it is my\\n', 'consciousness: the action (and the pleasure or pain attached) is mine.

Therefore, insofar as there is a natural connection between consciousness and\\n', 'the concern we have for any happiness, it must be a connection between self-\\n', 'consciousness and the concern for happiness. It is a concern for myself insofar as\\n', 'I am a being that experiences pleasure and pain.\\n', '\\n', '28 Note that Locke’s use of “concern” here can be with respect to either past or future-regarding actions.\\n', '\\n', 'As argued earlier, only in the latter sense could it take on the technical meaning.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', 'Perhaps the clearest connection Locke makes between consciousness and a con-\\n', 'cern for happiness is in his II.xxvii.26 definition of ‘person’:29\\n', 'It is a Forensick Term appropriating Actions and their Merit; and so belongs only to intelligent\\n', 'Agents capable of a Law, and Happiness and Misery.

On Yaffe’s (2000: 120, 126) view, which includes\\n', 'features similar to an appropriation-like interpretation of personal identity in Locke,\\n', 'consciousness (or those thoughts and actions we are conscious of) sets the bound-\\n', 'aries of a particular person.31 Moreover, our choices are necessarily internal to us.\\n', '\\n', 'Choices are essentially internal to us as persons, because were we not conscious of\\n', 'them, they would not count as choices at all. So insofar as we are conscious of our\\n', 'choices, there is a connection between a feature of us as persons (consciousness) and\\n', 'something essentially internal to us leading to action (a choice, or volition).\\n', '\\n', 'Unfortunately, though, as Yaffe realizes and confronts, this link between us as\\n', 'persons and our choices is not enough, for it is merely correlation; consciousness\\n', 'does not play a role itself in the production of the action, and so is not enough to\\n', 'locate a source of agency. Rather, according to Yaffe (2000: 130), “we want our\\n', 'choices not merely to be essentially internal to ourselves; we also want the fact of their\\n', 'internality to account for their causal role.” We want the feature of us as persons to be\\n', 'linked to the cause of a particular choice, or volition—to what moves the will. That\\n', 'can be achieved, he argues, by focusing on the relation between consciousness and\\n', 'pleasure and pain. Yaffe turns to Locke’s II.i.11 claim, cited earlier, that it makes no\\n', 'sense that we can have pleasure and pain and not be conscious of it. But notice that\\n', 'he (2000: 133) emphasizes that Locke is making a conceptual point:\\n', '[T]he very idea of having a pain without feeling it is “impossible” and “inconsistent.” In this\\n', 'respect, pains and pleasure are for Locke like choices: a modification of an agent cannot\\n', 'possibly count as a pain or a pleasure unless the agent is “conscious” of it.\\n', '\\n', 'This allows Yaffe (2000: 133) to draw the following conclusion:\\n', 'As uneasinesses are pains, and pains always involve “consciousness,” and “consciousness” is\\n', 'constitutive of personal identity, to say that an agent’s volitions are caused by her uneasinesses\\n', 'is to say that they are caused by a state that is essentially internal to her qua person, for a state of an agent of which she is not “conscious” cannot possibly count as a pain.\\n', '\\n', 'Yaffe has established the link he sought between consciousness (the boundaries of\\n', 'personal identity) and the cause of an act of the will.

Our choices can be said to come from us as persons.\\n', '\\n', '31 Yaffe (2007) abandons this interpretation of the boundaries of consciousness, and in fact argues against it. Since here I am interested only in the link between consciousness and choice (or between persons and their actions) in order to establish a more robust notion of agency, the status of an appropriation interpretation, or whether Yaffe abandoned it, matters not to my argument. In fact, in chapter four, I argued quite vociferously against it.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', 'I am sympathetic to much of Yaffe’s solution to the problem of establishing\\n', 'sufficient agency in Locke’s causal theory of action.

I have also argued that concern for true happiness, as the motivation\\n', 'for suspension and deliberation, causally links an agent to her choices sufficiently to\\n', 'answer Yaffe’s “Where’s the agent problem.” A question might still be lingering: If we\\n', 'have a natural concern for true happiness similar to our natural drive toward\\n', 'pleasure and away from pain generally, then why do we not always suspend desire?\\n', '\\n', 'Why do we sometimes lack the requisite concern to suspend a desire, and why do\\n', 'some people suspend their desires more often than others? The answer lies in the role\\n', 'of education and habituation in developing a more rational nature. In Some Thoughts\\n', 'Concerning Education, after having provided advice about how best to care for the\\n', 'body, Locke moves to the care of the mind:\\n', 'Due care being had to keep the body in strength and vigor so that it may be able to obey and\\n', 'execute the orders of the mind, the next principle business is to set the mind right, that on all\\n', 'occasions it may be disposed to consent to nothing but what may be suitable to the dignity and\\n', 'excellency of a rational creature.\\n', '\\n', '(Locke 1996/1693: 25)\\n', 'Consenting only to that which reason recommends leads to the perfection, or what Locke\\n', 'calls the “excellency,” of an intellectual being, namely a creature capable of being guided\\n', 'by reason. Then Locke tells us what that excellence consists in and how to achieve it:\\n', 'It seems plain to me that the principle of all virtue and excellency lies in a power of denying\\n', 'ourselves the satisfaction of our own desires where reason does not authorize them. This power\\n', 'is to be got and improved by custom, made easy and familiar by an early practice.\\n', '\\n', '(Locke 1996/1693: 29)\\n', 'Now Locke does not use the terms “suspension” or the “the suspension of desire” in\\n', 'Some Thoughts Concerning Education, but it is clear that this is what he means.\\n', '\\n', 'Virtue and excellence in a rational nature consist in reason taking the lead in action;\\n', 'we are able to resist our desires in order that we can rationally assess what is best for\\n', 'us to do in order to achieve happiness.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', 'Moreover, the strength of this power to suspend desire comes with education and\\n', 'habituation:\\n', 'He that has not a mastery over his inclinations, he that knows not how to resist the importunity of present pleasure or pain for the sake of what reason tells him is fit to be done, wants the true principle of virtue and industry and is in danger never to be good for anything. This temper, therefore, so\\n', 'contrary to unguided nature, is to be got betimes; and this habit, as the true foundation of future ability and happiness, is to be wrought into the mind as early as may be.\\n', '\\n', '(Locke 1996/1693: 32)\\n', 'If what I said at the beginning of this discourse be true, as I do not doubt but it is, viz. that the difference to be found in the manners and abilities of men is owing more to their education than\\n', 'to anything else, we have reason to conclude that great care is to be had of the forming children’s minds and giving them that seasoning early that shall influence their lives always after. . . . As the strength of the body lies chiefly in being able to endure hardships, so also does that of the mind.\\n', '\\n', 'And the great principle and foundation of all virtue and worth is placed in this, that a man is able to deny himself his own desires, cross his own inclinations, and purely follow what reason directs\\n', 'as best though the appetite lean the other way.\\n', '\\n', '(Locke 1996/1693: 25)\\n', 'So, first, Locke confirms that we all have the capacity to resist a desire, but that whether\\n', 'or not, and how well, we are able to exercise that capacity, how strong is our ability to\\n', 'suspend desire, depends on whether or not we have been educated, or habituated, to\\n', 'do it. And just as the body must be cared for and strengthened in order to resist the\\n', 'physical difficulties we face, our minds must be strengthened in order to resist our\\n', 'own inclinations, so that reason is allowed its proper role in our lives.\\n', '\\n', 'Second, Locke tells us how the mind is strengthened so that we are able to resist our\\n', 'inclinations. Although we are all born with the capacity to use reason, we are not born\\n', 'fully rational and moral agents. Locke is clear that young children lack ideas of\\n', 'reflection (II.i.8), which suggests they also lack other complex abilities of the under-\\n', 'standing, say, the ability to make rational judgments about what conduces to long-\\n', 'term happiness. Locke says as much when he contrasts the difference in parenting a\\n', 'younger as opposed to a grown child: “For liberty and indulgence can do no good to\\n', 'children: their want of judgment makes them stand in need of restraint and discipline”\\n', '(Locke 1996/1693: 31). Because young children cannot make moral judgments, they\\n', 'must be constrained to act properly. Contrast this approach with his advice concern-\\n', 'ing a parent’s relation to a much older child. “We must look upon our children, when\\n', 'grown up, to be like ourselves: with the same passions, the same desires. We would be\\n', 'thought rational creatures, and have our freedom” (Locke 1996/1693: 31). Grown\\n', 'children no longer need to be constrained by means of parental discipline because like\\n', 'their parents they can rely on their own reason (and freedom to use it) to guide them.\\n', '\\n', 'Moreover, the mere passage of years and the subjection to disciplinary measures\\n', 'are not the most important causes of a more fully developed rational (and virtuous)\\n', 'nature. Most important is a substantive education:\\n', 'Indeed, fear of having a scanty portion if they displease you may make them [your children]\\n', 'slaves to your estate, but they will be never the less ill and wicked in private; and that restraint\\n', '\\n', 'CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', '\\n', 'will not last always. Every man must sometime or other be trusted to himself and his own\\n', 'conduct; and he that is good, a virtuous and able man must be made so within. And therefore\\n', 'what he is to receive from education, what is to sway and influence his life, must be something put into him betimes: habits woven into the very principles of his nature.\\n', '\\n', '(Locke 1996/1693: 31–2)\\n', 'A child receiving the right kind of education will develop “habits woven into the very\\n', 'principles of his nature.” Locke is clear that this sort of education does not consist in the\\n', 'rote learning of rules whether inculcated by discipline or by tutors, but rather in\\n', 'habituating virtue (good moral reasoning) as the result of practice and following the\\n', 'example of others. In Of the Conduct of the Understanding, Locke (1996/1706: 173)\\n', 'reiterates his view: “We are born with faculties and powers capable of almost anything,\\n', 'such at least as would carry us farther than can easily be imagined: but it is only the\\n', 'exercise of those powers which gives us ability and skill in anything, and leads us towards\\n', 'perfection,” and a little later he says, “the faculties of our souls are improved and made\\n', 'useful to us just after the same manner as our bodies are . . . ; we are born to be if we\\n', 'please, rational creatures, but it is use and exercise only that makes us so.” Through\\n', 'exercise and practice our capacity to suspend desire and engage in good reasoning (and\\n', 'so also virtuous conduct) is transformed into a natural skill.\\n', '\\n', 'Although Locke thinks the best education for a rational mind comes from the\\n', 'practice of mathematics, the lack of sufficient leisure does not lessen one’s obligation\\n', '“to think and reason right about what is their daily employment” (Locke 1996/1706:\\n', '182). Not to expect at least that of an adult rational being is tantamount to “leveling\\n', 'them with the brutes, and charging them with a stupidity below the rank of a rational\\n', 'creature” (Locke 1996/1706: 182). There is, however, one duty to education we all have:\\n', '“Besides his particular calling for the support of this life, everyone has a concern in a\\n', 'future life, which he is bound to look after. This engages his thoughts in religion; and\\n', 'here it mightily lies upon him to understand and reason right” (Locke 1996/1706: 182).\\n', '\\n', 'Locke continues that the best way to fit the mind to the kind of education offered by\\n', 'religion is to “fill it with moral and more abstract ideas” (Locke 1996/1706: 183).

But\\n', 'once we gain the ability to determine the difference between apparent and true\\n', 'happiness, which is then aided by experience and education, we come to be naturally\\n', 'moved to seek that which is more suitable to the beings we have become—beings who\\n', 'can exercise an intellectual nature. Now not only are we driven toward pleasure and\\n', 'away from pain, but also we are concerned that what we are driven toward is true as\\n', 'opposed to apparent happiness.

I then concen-\\n', 'trated primarily on establishing (2), that Locke’s theory of personal identity includes a\\n', 'metaphysical fact of an ongoing self, a continuing consciousness. But also important\\n', 'to Locke’s “forensic” account of persons (that persons are “intelligent Agents capable\\n', 'of a Law, and Happiness and Misery” (II.xxvii.26)) is that we are able to experience\\n', 'ourselves as ongoing—as temporal beings. That is, the metaphysical fact of a con-\\n', 'tinuing consciousness is revealed to us as a phenomenological fact of ourselves as\\n', 'extending into the past and into the future.

In this section, we will see how pre-reflective consciousness constituent in every\\n', 'mental act provides such an experience necessary for moral motivation.\\n', '\\n', 'Locke’s account of moral agency includes that we experience ourselves as temporal\\n', 'beings.

But also, as we know from his account of personal identity in II.xxvii.,\\n', 'being a person requires that we also have a diachronic experience of ourselves:\\n', 'This being premised to find wherein personal identity consists, we must consider what Person\\n', 'stands for; which, I think, is a thinking intelligent Being, that has reason and reflection, and\\n', 'can consider it self as it self, that same thinking thing in different times and places; which it\\n', 'does only by that consciousness, which is inseparable from thinking, and it seems to me\\n', 'essential to it.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxvii.9)\\n', '\\n', 'CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', '\\n', 'Consciousness allows for an experience of our own diachronic unity, because we are\\n', 'conscious of ourselves as the same self in different perceptions of ideas. In chapter\\n', 'four, I gave a promissory note to explain how we achieve unity of consciousness. It is\\n', 'time now to cash it in. As we saw only briefly in chapter four, Locke argues that\\n', 'consciousness provides for the experience of ourselves as extending into the past.\\n', '\\n', 'Consciousness, Locke says, “joins” thoughts and actions to a single self:\\n', 'That with which the consciousness of this present thinking thing can join it self, makes the same\\n', 'Person, and is one self with it, and with nothing else; and so attributes to it self, and owns all the Actions of that thing, as its own, as far as that consciousness reaches, and no farther; as\\n', 'everyone who reflects will perceive.

What I take to be happening now is not instantaneous, not confined within a knife-edge present, but fills some short stretch of time, and these nows overlap one another. For each now there is, we might say, an I-occurrence, and successive I-occurrences will similarly overlap and fade into one another: thus these I-occurrences build up into a continuous I-history. The single person, the I, is what is taken to be there, all at once, at each moment in an I-history. This constitutes my identity throughout any one waking day, any period throughout which I am continuously conscious.” Periods of unconsciousness are filled by what Mackie calls “memory bridges.” Mackie ultimately rejects the revision because he thinks that Locke rejects it. I would argue that because Mackie is reading Locke as having an appropriation theory of sorts, he misreads Locke’s claims concerning “distinct incommunicable consciousnesses” in II.xxvii.20 as meaning different collections of conscious states or memories, rather than a point about the relation between a single man and two metaphysically distinct consciousnesses, which would give rise to two phenomenologically distinct experiences of one’s own thinking.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', 'something like an extended or continuing present. In being conscious of my indi-\\n', 'vidual successive perceptions of ideas as an uninterrupted continuous stream of\\n', 'thinking, which seems to happen in reasoning, I am conscious of myself as something\\n', 'that continues to exist, as having a temporally extended existence.44\\n', 'As was mentioned briefly in the last chapter, we see the same sort of thing happening\\n', 'in reflection, in particular on a past thought, as the perceptual situation in which\\n', 'consciousness is “extended backwards” in the appropriation of a past action.

Zahavi (2005: 56) describes the problem as Husserl undertook it in this way: “In his Vorlesungen zur Phänome-nologie des inneren Zeitbewusstseins, Husserl asks how it is possible for us to be conscious of temporal objects. His well-known thesis is that a perception of a temporal object, as well as the perception of succession and change, would be impossible if consciousness provided us only with access to the pure now-phase of the object and if the stream of consciousness itself was a series of unconnected points of experiencing, like a line of pearls. Had our perception been restricted to being conscious of that which exists right now, it would have been impossible to perceive anything with temporal extension and duration, for a succession of isolated, punctual, conscious states does not, as such, enable us to experience succession and duration. Since we are obviously conscious of succession and duration, we must acknowledge that our consciousness, one way or another, can encompass more than that which is given right now. Although we can be co-conscious of that which has just been, and that which is about to occur, the crucial question remains: how can we be conscious of that which is no longer, or not yet, present to our consciousness?\\n', '\\n', 'Some have suggested that imagination or memory might play a crucial role. There is however an obvious difference between seeing a movement (that necessarily extends in time) or hearing a melody, and\\n', 'remembering or imagining either. Husserl’s own alternative is to insist on the width of presence.”\\n', '45 See, again, chapter three, part II, section II.4, and chapter four, section 4.2 for Locke’s account of memory and particularly the phenomenology of memory.\\n', '\\n', '46 Note that Locke’s claim that a person must have reflection is yet another piece of evidence that he thinks consciousness is something that continues to exist through momentary conscious states of itself as thinking.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', '\\n', 'Again, reconstructing Locke’s view in this way bears remarkable similarity to more\\n', 'recent work in the phenomenology of consciousness. Here is Zahavi’s (2011: 329)\\n', 'description of how the “first-personal character” of successive perceptions of ideas\\n', 'allows for the experience of the unity of consciousness:\\n', 'The self doesn’t actively unite disparate bits of experience, nor is the self an extra element that must be added to the stream of consciousness in order to ensure its unification. The point is\\n', 'rather that all experiences that share the same primary presence or first-personal character are\\n', 'mine. To put it differently, experiential (diachronic and synchronic) unity is constituted by\\n', 'first personal character.\\n', '\\n', 'The self does not actively unify thinking; rather, that all thinking has internal to it the\\n', 'same first-personal character ensures that we experience the same self as thinking in\\n', 'a continuous stream.47\\n', 'Alternatively, consider what Locke thinks happens when there is no sameness of\\n', 'first-personal character, namely when consciousnesses are experienced as unrelated:\\n', 'For it is evident in the instance I gave just now, if the consciousness went along with the little\\n', 'Finger, when it was cut off, that would be the same self which was concerned for the whole\\n', 'Body Yesterday, as making a part of it self, whose Actions then it cannot but admit as it own\\n', 'now.

So when it is in the finger, I would experience myself as being concerned\\n', 'about the finger, but I would not experience myself as concerned about the body.\\n', '\\n', '47 Note that Zahavi is explaining how we have a pre-reflective experience of the unity of consciousness.\\n', '\\n', 'Consider Zahavi’s (2005: 132) explanation of the experience of ourselves in remembering: “To determine whether a past experience is mine, I do not first need to assure myself of the uninterrupted, temporal continuity between my present recollection and the past experience. If I have first-personal access to the past experience, it is automatically given as my past experience. There is more to episodic memory than the retrieval of information from the past. The subjective experience of remembering involves the conviction that the remembered episode was once experienced by me.” Moreover, like Zahavi’s description, were\\n', 'reflection needed to experience the unity of consciousness, then we would also have other ideas generated, which Locke does not include in his discussion of the unity of consciousness. For example, were I to reflect specifically on a succession of ideas, there would be generated an idea of succession and then of duration:\\n', '“’Tis evident to any one who will but observe what passes in his own Mind, that there is a train of Ideas, which constantly succeed one another in his Understanding, as long as he is awake. Reflection on these appearances of several Ideas one after another in our Minds, is that which furnishes us with an Idea of Succession: And the distance between any parts of that Succession, or between the appearance of any two Ideas in our Minds, is that we call Duration” (II.xiv.3). Thus, the unity of consciousness is achieved by virtue of pre-reflective consciousness constituent of every mental state and not by either an idea of the self or the contiguity of mental states themselves.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', 'Similarly, were each perception of an idea to have its own “peculiar consciousness” (as\\n', 'analogous to the example of the finger and the body), there would be no experience of\\n', 'the unity of thinking, no experience of the same self, the same I, in different percep-\\n', 'tions of ideas, say, the same my self that celebrated her twenty-first birthday or just\\n', 'wrote the previous sentence. And importantly for Locke, were there no sense that past\\n', 'selves are identical to me and so their actions belong to me, there would be no attitude\\n', 'of concern (in the non-technical sense) for what I have done or that I might be\\n', 'punished for it. I would have no reason to care that what I have done turns out well for\\n', 'me instead of badly. Without such an experience of the unity of consciousness, our\\n', 'past actions would be of no more concern to us than if they had been done by someone\\n', 'else.

For example, we disagree somewhat about how to interpret consciousness and also how to interpret the nature of persons.

In\\n', 'considering a future pleasure, Locke says, a person “bring[s] it home upon himself, and\\n', 'consider[s] it as present, and there takes its true dimensions” (II.xxi.63).

Key, therefore, to Locke’s “forensic” account of persons,\\n', 'namely human beings considered as moral beings, capable of moral agency and\\n', 'responsibility, is that through consciousness we are related to future actions (and\\n', 'selves) such that it makes sense to say that we can be motivated to do them.

We can consider the pleasure (or pain) to be gained from getting what we desire as well as considering the pleasure (or pain) gained from the consequences of getting what we desire (II.xxi.66).\\n', '\\n', '51 See, again, II.xxi.51 and II.xxi.47.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', '5.6 Animals are Conscious Too\\n', 'I have argued that the fact that we are conscious beings is foundational to the concern\\n', 'for ourselves that we are happy—that we attain the most pleasure possible—in this\\n', 'life and in an afterlife.

What does this argument\\n', 'mean for the moral status of animals? As part of my earlier argument that Yaffe’s\\n', 'solution to the “Where’s the agent problem” is insufficient to account for moral\\n', 'agency, I invoked the difference between non-human animals and persons. Let me\\n', 'say a little more about that now.\\n', '\\n', 'Because Locke thinks that all animals have perception, and all perception is\\n', 'conscious, he is committed to the view that all animals are conscious. Moreover,\\n', 'I have been arguing that Locke thinks that all consciousness is self-consciousness.\\n', '\\n', 'I realize that assigning consciousness and self-consciousness to very low forms of\\n', 'animal life (as Locke does to oysters and cockles) is quite odd. But perhaps we can see\\n', 'it as a matter of degree. Certainly, it is not so odd to think that many animals in some\\n', 'form or other assign their sensations (especially pleasures and pains) to themselves. It\\n', 'might also be that having more neural capacities (collections of neurons and ganglia)\\n', 'affects the nature and degree of consciousness in animals. Certainly these things can\\n', 'affect the nature of mental activity in general and whether or not the animal has more\\n', 'or fewer mental functions and the degree of their sophistication. Similarly, having\\n', 'reflection and various capacities for reason may affect the difference in the nature\\n', 'and degree of self-consciousness in persons and animals. Moreover, in order for\\n', 'many animals to be moved toward pleasures and away from pains, which they\\n', 'obviously are (and in a way that is not merely stimulus response), they, in some\\n', 'sense, must be able to see themselves as achieving those pleasures or pains.52 Thus, it\\n', 'is not at all a stretch to say that some animals are pre-reflectively self-conscious and\\n', 'have unity of consciousness.\\n', '\\n', 'Now for the sticking point: Given that Locke thinks that all animals are conscious,\\n', 'would my interpretation not entail that (especially higher-functioning) animals have\\n', 'the same concern for their own pleasure and pain and so might have the same\\n', 'freedom we do? And if they have the same freedom, are they on the brink of moral\\n', 'agency? No, for they are unable to reflect and reason in the right way, and therefore\\n', 'cannot rationally assess (as Locke would see it) competing goods and compare their\\n', 'actions to laws, which is required for moral agency. True, Locke does consider\\n', 'animals (brutes) to have some form of reason: “For if they [brutes] have any Ideas\\n', '52 I am grateful to the NYC/NJ Early Modern Philosophy Group, including Enrique Chavez Arvizo,\\n', 'Raffaella De Rosa, Alan Gabby, Don Garrett, Jessica Gordon-Roth, Christia Mercer, Paola Nicholas, and Justin Steinberg, for very helpful suggestions about how to think about the capacities of animals.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', '\\n', 'at all, and are not bare Machins (as some would have them) we cannot deny them to\\n', 'have some reason” (II.xi.11).

He says, “If it may be doubted,\\n', 'whether Beasts compound and enlarge their Ideas that way, to any degree: This,\\n', 'I think, I may be positive in, That the power of Abstracting is not at all in them; and\\n', 'that the having of general Ideas, is that which puts a perfect distinction betwixt Man\\n', 'and Brutes; and is as Excellency which the Faculties of Brutes do by no means attain\\n', 'to” (II.xi.10). That brutes do not have abstract ideas precludes them from the sort of\\n', 'reasoning necessary for moral agency, for considering the value of competing goods\\n', 'as they do or do not compare to laws requires abstract ideas.\\n', '\\n', 'Animals, therefore, are not “forensic” beings and so do not have the proper\\n', 'motivation (the concern for true happiness) to suspend the will. Remember that\\n', 'the suspension of the will and the making of rationally informed choices is the\\n', 'perfection of an intellectual nature.53 It leads to the kind and degree of happiness\\n', 'suitable to our “frame and constitution” as intelligent agents capable of a law and true\\n', 'happiness and misery, including in an afterlife. Analogously, we might see the\\n', 'perfection of an animal nature as consisting in the capacities that lead to the attaining\\n', 'of whatever kind and degree of happiness is suitable to its frame and constitution—\\n', 'perhaps its physical “preservation and the continuation of its species” (II.xxi.34).\\n', '\\n', 'Although this passage from II.xxi.34 describes God’s having given human beings\\n', 'what they need for physical preservation, for example, the pangs of hunger and thirst,\\n', 'I take it that Locke is talking about human beings insofar as they are physical\\n', 'creatures, and not insofar as they might also be moral agents. Human beings\\n', 'considered in this way have what they need for the kind and degree of happiness\\n', 'suitable for a creature with that nature. Note that I am drawing a distinction between\\n', 'animals and persons instead of between non-human and human animals. Because of\\n', 'Locke’s commitment to nominalism (that the world does not come presorted into\\n', 'kinds) and his skepticism regarding what we can know of the inner constitutions of\\n', 'things, when it comes to the moral status of beings, it is unclear that he would want to\\n', 'draw a line between non-human and human animals, or between different animals,\\n', 'for fear of making a mistake. Indeed, this commitment might also be driving Locke’s\\n', 'reticence to deny perception and consciousness to mollusks.54\\n', 'For purposes of moral agency, the distinction is between animals (human and\\n', 'otherwise) and persons. In II.xxvii.9, Locke defines ‘person’ as “a thinking intelligent\\n', 'Being, that has reason and reflection, and can consider it self as it self, the same\\n', 'thinking thing in different times and places; which it does only by . . . consciousness.”\\n', 'It seems to me that this would include Prince Maurice’s rational parrot (II.xxvii.8), as\\n', 'long as it had reflection too.

Since animals\\n', 'are conscious, for Locke, their mental capacities must be distinguishable from persons\\n', 'by the fact that they do not have the right kind of reason and reflection and so are not\\n', 'capable of laws. So just as we, namely beings with an intellectual nature (moral agents),\\n', 'naturally have what we need to attain our perfection, including our long-term preser-\\n', 'vation in this life and the next, that is, a concern for true happiness resulting in the\\n', 'freedom to act according to what reason recommends, animals have what they need to\\n', 'attain their perfection, including preservation here and now.55 Were it otherwise, I dare\\n', 'say we would all be created miserable.\\n', '\\n', '5.7 Conclusion\\n', 'In this chapter, I have argued that consciousness plays a significant role in Locke’s\\n', 'account of rational and moral agency. That we are conscious beings is fundamental\\n', 'to the natural concern for ourselves that we attain true happiness—long-term\\n', 'happiness in this life and the next. Such concern for our own true happiness is\\n', 'crucial to the perfection of our nature as intellectual beings, for it results in our\\n', 'freedom to act according to what reason recommends. Our natural concern for our\\n', 'own true happiness ensures that our actions flow from our reason, because it moves\\n', 'the will to suspend present desires; it ensures the rational consideration of whether or\\n', 'not the action presently desired contributes to our true happiness. I have also argued\\n', 'that this account of consciousness allows for the unity of consciousness required for\\n', 'both moral responsibility and moral motivation. It provides the experience of a\\n', 'past self, which is necessary for assuming moral responsibility for past actions, and\\n', 'of a future self, which is necessary for generating the kind of motivation proper to\\n', 'moral agency.\\n', '\\n', 'With this account of the way consciousness grounds moral agency, the narrative\\n', 'established at the beginning of this book comes full circle. That narrative began with\\n', 'the recognition that conscience, understood as an inner evaluative (moral) awareness\\n', 'of oneself, is not the only kind of self-awareness we experience. Indeed, it even seems\\n', '(as was clear in Cudworth and is now clear in Locke) that rationally assessing the\\n', 'moral value of our own actions depends on a more fundamental non moral aware-\\n', 'ness of ourselves and of our own thinking. Consciousness, as a non-evaluative form\\n', 'of self-awareness, is fundamental not only to our philosophical psychology but also\\n', '55 Such a view is not inconsistent with the successful training of animals or even what often appears in animals to be a deliberative consideration of whether or not to act on a desire. For those kinds of behaviors need not require reflection or reasoning and forming judgments, but are easily explained by an association of ideas, a capacity Locke can easily grant to animals. Moreover, it is true that animals will stop themselves from achieving something they desire if they perceive a danger or an oncoming pain as the result of it. But, again, this seems to me more a process of a tug one way and then the other as the result of a succession of contrary desires (as the result of an association of ideas) than the kind of suspension of desire that Locke thinks grounds our freedom.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL MOTIVATION\\n', '\\n', 'to our agency and to our experience of ourselves as rational and moral agents\\n', 'concerned about the long-term consequences of our actions. Moreover, for Locke,\\n', 'in order to be moral beings we must first be conscious beings. Having an evaluative\\n', 'experience of ourselves as moral beings (conscience) requires having a non-\\n', 'evaluative experience of ourselves as thinking beings (consciousness).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Conclusion\\n', 'In light of the fledgling conceptions of consciousness found in some of Locke’s\\n', 'predecessors and contemporaries, this book argues for an interpretation of con-\\n', 'sciousness in Locke which makes sense of the various roles it plays in the Essay. Most\\n', 'importantly, consciousness has a role to play in Locke’s philosophical psychology\\n', 'and in his theories of knowledge, personal identity, and moral agency.\\n', '\\n', 'Once consciousness is seen as a self-referential awareness internal to any act of\\n', 'thinking, the well-known interpretive problem of finding a suitable fit for conscious-\\n', 'ness in Locke’s model of the mind is solved. All thinking can be conscious without\\n', 'inviting a regress, threatening Locke’s empiricism, or conflicting with his commitment\\n', 'to the paucity of reflective abilities in young children. In addition, consciousness\\n', 'understood in this way lends coherence to Locke’s claims that we are always conscious\\n', 'of an I that is perceiving as well as being aware of the different perceptual sources of our\\n', 'ideas.\\n', '\\n', 'Consciousness of an I perceiving internal to any mental act, which lends a first-\\n', 'personal character to all our thinking, entails that perceptions of ideas are complex\\n', 'mental states with constituent elements. At the very least there is an act of perception,\\n', 'an idea perceived, and consciousness. In addition, though, Locke sees every perception\\n', 'of an idea as accompanied by the perception of a simple idea of existence. Thus, every\\n', 'perception of an idea is actually a complex mental state composed of at least two ideas\\n', 'and consciousness. As I have argued, such complexity results in the fact that, for Locke,\\n', 'perceptions of ideas are complex propositional states.\\n', '\\n', 'This explanation of the nature of our mental states opens the door to understand-\\n', 'ing how Locke could define knowledge in general as the perception of an agreement\\n', 'of ideas and yet also claim that some agreements can be known either on the basis\\n', 'of a single act of perception (whereby we know our own existence), or on the basis of\\n', 'the perception of a single idea, (whereby we know that individual idea). And if that\\n', 'single idea is an occurrent idea of sensation, we have knowledge of the existence of\\n', 'the cause of that idea insofar as Locke sees sensitive knowledge as a species of\\n', 'knowledge. Moreover, the analysis of how we know these kinds of particular truths\\n', 'is not unlike how we more standardly know general truths. In the latter case too, we\\n', 'have knowledge as the result of a complex mental state in which the compared or\\n', 'juxtaposed simultaneous ideas agree and are perceived to agree. Therefore, an\\n', 'analysis of the complexity of our mental states and the constituents therein provides\\n', '\\n', 'CONCLUSION\\n', '\\n', 'a coherent account of how we can know all the various types of agreements in Locke’s\\n', 'theory of knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'What is more, this analysis makes sense of Locke’s division of knowledge into\\n', 'degrees of certainty and his repeated claims that in spite of the fact that all knowledge\\n', 'is the perception of an agreement of ideas, we have sensitive knowledge of the\\n', 'existence of things external to us. Agreements perceived just in virtue of a complex\\n', 'mental state wherein there are agreeing constituents have psychological features that\\n', 'meet Locke’s conditions for certain knowledge. But not all perceived agreements\\n', 'meet other normative conditions that provide a higher degree of certainty. Where\\n', 'intuitive knowledge and demonstrative knowledge meet further normative condi-\\n', 'tions, sensitive knowledge does not. Thus, not only is having knowledge as the result\\n', 'of the complexity of our mental states fully compatible with Locke’s theory of\\n', 'knowledge as stated in the Essay and elsewhere, but also it lends consistency to\\n', 'that theory where it has always seemed somewhat lacking.\\n', '\\n', 'Understanding the dual role of consciousness in Locke’s theory of personal\\n', 'identity enables us to see why Locke would place so much importance on a psycho-\\n', 'logical condition for identity while at the same time holding on to commitments that\\n', 'require a metaphysical condition. Locke uses the term ‘consciousness’ ambiguously\\n', 'to mean both the psychological awareness of myself as thinking and as the meta-\\n', 'physical ongoing self I am aware of in that conscious state. Once we see that Locke’s\\n', 'theory includes a metaphysical criterion, all of the pieces of the theory fall neatly into\\n', 'place. Locke’s theory avoids the problems of transitivity, circularity, and sufficiency\\n', 'for his moral theory and his theological concerns. Furthermore, that consciousness\\n', 'provides a first-personal character to each mental act explains how we can experience\\n', 'the kind of diachronic unity of consciousness so necessary to Locke’s account of\\n', 'moral agency. Experiencing a past self is necessary for us to take responsibility for\\n', 'what we have done, and anticipating a future self is required for us to assess our\\n', 'future actions in terms of their moral value. Finally, that we are conscious of\\n', 'ourselves in every mental act is at the heart of a concern for our own true happiness,\\n', 'which enables us to exercise the kind of freedom necessary for moral agency and the\\n', 'perfection of an intellectual being. Therefore, we should see the conception of\\n', 'consciousness argued for here as a vital thread running through and pulling together\\n', 'central themes and arguments in Locke’s Essay.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'References\\n', 'Aaron, Richard I.

In this\\n', 'book, I extend my analysis of the role of consciousness in Locke’s Essay Concerning\\n', 'Human Understanding to other areas of his philosophy, including his theories of\\n', 'knowledge, personal identity, and moral agency. Consciousness is a thread running\\n', 'through and helping to resolve tensions in many of the most important aspects of\\n', 'Locke’s philosophy. Incipient is a complete picture of the role of consciousness in\\n', 'Locke’s Essay.\\n', '\\n', 'One theme will emerge as important to understanding the role consciousness plays\\n', 'in the Essay. Consciousness is self-consciousness. It is a non-evaluative self-\\n', 'referential form of awareness internal to all perceptions of ideas. It is the perception\\n', 'that I am perceiving an idea, or the perception of myself as perceiving an idea. Thus, a\\n', 'central theme running through the book is that perceptions of ideas, for Locke, are\\n', 'complex mental states in which we are conscious of more than just the idea\\n', 'perceived. In any perception of an idea, there is, at the very least, an act of perception,\\n', 'an idea perceived, and consciousness (that I am perceiving). And not only is there a\\n', 'complexity involved in the way in which perceptions of ideas can be said to perform\\n', 'their representational function, but also there is a complexity in perceptions of ideas\\n', 'that results in knowledge and that results in both a synchronic and diachronic\\n', 'experience of the unity of consciousness. How consciousness as internal to a more\\n', 'complex mental state can be seen to contribute to different perceptual situations has\\n', 'significant import for understanding various aspects of Locke’s philosophy. Showing\\n', 'that significance is a primary task of the book.\\n', '\\n', 'Here are just two ways, very briefly, in which this interpretation of consciousness\\n', 'plays out in Locke’s philosophy. First, consciousness as a constituent of a more\\n', 'complex mental state plays a significant role in constituting some agreements of\\n', 'ideas, the perception of which, for Locke, counts as knowledge. Importantly forLocke\\n', 'scholarship, once the complexity of our mental states is appreciated, we will see that\\n', 'Locke has no problem reconciling his general definition of knowledge as the percep-\\n', 'tion of an agreement or disagreement of ideas with his claims that we have know-\\n', 'ledge of particular things—of individual ideas, of our own existence, and of external\\n', 'world objects—all cases in which Locke seems to say that we perceive only one idea.\\n', '\\n', 'A big advantage of the interpretation, then, is that I show not only how Locke can\\n', 'consistently claim that we have knowledge of particular things, but also that the\\n', 'complexity of our perceptual states makes possible the agreement perceived in each\\n', 'case. What results is a structurally integrated account of how, for Locke, we have\\n', 'knowledge of individual ideas, of ourselves, and of external objects. All three turn out to be cases of non-inferential knowledge. Moreover, the analysis is not unlike how,\\n', 'for Locke, we more standardly know general truths. Therefore, interpreting con-\\n', 'sciousness as internal to a more complex mental state plays an important role in\\n', 'Locke’s theory of knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'Second, because consciousness is self-consciousness and is a constituent of a more\\n', 'complex mental state, there can be an experience of the unity of consciousness in\\n', 'perceiving simultaneous and successive ideas. Moreover, when there are ideas in the\\n', 'mind simultaneously and there are agreements between those ideas, we will be\\n', 'conscious of those agreements. Along with its contribution to an analysis of how\\n', 'there can be a seamless experience of the mind’s manipulation of ideas resulting in\\n', 'more complex ideas or in having knowledge, consciousness as internal to each\\n', 'perception of an idea allows that in certain kinds of perceptual situations we can\\n', 'be aware of ourselves as temporally extended. Such an experience of a past and future\\n', 'self is crucial to Locke’s accounts of personal identity and moral agency. So, con-\\n', 'sciousness as internal to any perceptual state allows for the experience we have of our\\n', 'own thinking as consisting in a sophistication and complexity necessary for under-\\n', 'standing aspects of Locke’s theory of knowledge, as well as of his theories of personal\\n', 'identity and moral agency, and resolving tensions in all three.\\n', '\\n', 'As the book unfolds, it will become clear exactly how consciousness plays its role\\n', 'in various areas of Locke’s philosophy and how the interpretation helps to resolve\\n', 'problems therein. Interpreting consciousness and the functions it performs, as I have,\\n', 'goes beyond what Locke says explicitly in the Essay or elsewhere. This is not to say\\n', 'that there is not sufficient textual evidence in favor of the interpretation, and I have\\n', 'limited my arguments to those areas of Locke’s philosophy where he obviously\\n', 'considered consciousness to play a positive role. But because of the paucity of\\n', 'explanation by Locke concerning how he understood consciousness, I have had to\\n', 'fill out the story for him. I suspect that Locke, himself, was not quite sure of his own\\n', 'conception. Nevertheless, once the needed distinctions concerning the nature of\\n', 'consciousness and the work it does are drawn for him, we see that other troubling\\n', 'aspects of Locke’s philosophy fall into place. Indeed, by providing a consistent account\\n', 'of how consciousness fits neatly into Locke’s philosophical psychology, by showing\\n', 'how consciousness as a constituent of a more complex mental state leads to a\\n', 'structurally integrated account of our knowledge of particular things, by providing\\n', 'an interpretation of consciousness in the theory of personal identity that solves well-\\n', 'known problems of transitivity, circularity, and sufficiency for Locke’s theological and\\n', 'moral concerns, and by providing a novel account of the nature of moral motivation,\\n', 'which provides for a robustness of agency needed and often lacking in causal theories\\n', 'of agency generally, I have gone much farther than any other interpretation of Locke\\n', 'on consciousness. In each case, I am making new and what I believe are important\\n', 'contributions to Locke scholarship. Of course, my claim is not that the interpretation\\n', 'of consciousness offered here solves all of Locke’s problems or that there might not be\\n', 'problems it cannot solve. I seek only to make Locke’s philosophy more coherent and integrated, and in the process provide solutions to what are considered some of its\\n', 'most troubling aspects.\\n', '\\n', 'In addition to lending internal coherence to Locke’s philosophy generally, another\\n', 'contribution of the interpretation is that Locke can be seen to be employing a notion\\n', 'of consciousness that is distinctively modern. As I read it, consciousness in Locke\\n', 'shares important similarities with later and contemporary phenomenological theor-\\n', 'ies of consciousness as well as with recent developments in cognitive science that\\n', 'argue for a distinct aspect of mentality responsible for the conscious awareness of the\\n', 'sources of our mental states. I am not claiming that these similarities should be seen\\n', 'as justification for my interpretation. Rather, because of these similarities I see this\\n', 'interpretation of consciousness and its role in Locke’s philosophy as having more\\n', 'than antiquarian interest.\\n', '\\n', 'After I historically situate the conception of consciousness I find in Locke in\\n', 'chapter one, I provide a much more detailed description of how that conception\\n', 'runs through other aspects of Locke’s philosophy. Nevertheless, a quick look at the\\n', 'book’s structure is in order. Chapter one sets the stage for seeing consciousness as a\\n', 'non-evaluative form of self-consciousness in Locke’s philosophical psychology. Early\\n', 'in the seventeenth century came the realization that not all forms of self-awareness\\n', 'are captured by the notion of conscience as an internal moral or evaluative awareness\\n', 'of oneself. By showing how some of Locke’s predecessors and contemporaries\\n', 'grappled with articulating this new kind of non-evaluative self-awareness, we can\\n', 'see how Locke himself might have seen the philosophical landscape and how he\\n', 'might have been influenced by what was going on around him. In this chapter, I am\\n', 'indebted to Catherine Glyn Davies’ (1990) and Udo Thiel’s (1994) work on Locke’s\\n', 'predecessors, which I discovered in 2005. It was primarily this early historical work\\n', 'by Thiel in addition to Mark Kulstad’s (1991) work on Locke that spurred my desire\\n', 'to find a consistent interpretation of consciousness in Locke (which I published in\\n', '2008) and to give an original account of its role in other aspects of his philosophy. In\\n', 'chapter two, I argue that Locke’s philosophical psychology includes a conception of\\n', 'consciousness as a special kind of reflexive awareness of ourselves internal to every\\n', 'act of perception. By distinguishing the consciousness of ourselves as thinking\\n', 'whenever we are thinking from other perceptual acts (primarily sensation and\\n', 'reflection), the interpretation is able to resolve a well-known tension in Locke’s\\n', 'model of the mind.\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter three is organized somewhat unusually in that it is divided into three\\n', 'parts, each of which provides an analysis of the role consciousness plays in aspects of\\n', 'Locke’s theory of knowledge: in how we have knowledge of individual ideas and of\\n', 'our own existence (in part I) and in how we have “sensitive” knowledge of the\\n', 'existence of external world objects (in part II). In each case, I provide a symmetrical\\n', 'account of the perception of an idea as a complex mental state in which conscious-\\n', 'ness is a constituent and has a significant role to play in the achievement of\\n', 'knowledge. These two parts together provide a coherent, integrated account of how we know particular things. In part III, I provide additional arguments to buttress the\\n', 'arguments in parts I and II, as well as addressing specific consequences of my view.\\n', '\\n', 'Moreover, the arguments in all three parts preserve consistency with all of Locke’s\\n', 'other commitments in his theory of knowledge. To my knowledge, there is currently\\n', 'no such account in Locke scholarship.\\n', '\\n', 'One might notice that I am excluding from the analysis the case of knowing God’s\\n', 'existence, which is the only other knowledge of a particular we have. The reason is\\n', 'that, for Locke, this is a form of demonstrative knowledge, namely inferential\\n', 'knowledge by means of a rational proof. Despite what one may think of the cogency\\n', 'of Locke’s argument, it does not present the same potential threat to Locke’s\\n', 'commitments in his theory of knowledge generally as do these other cases of\\n', 'knowing individual things. What is needed and what I provide is an account of\\n', 'how we have knowledge of particular truths seemingly when we perceive only one\\n', 'idea. The solution is to be found in the complexity of our perceptual states and the\\n', 'constituent elements, including consciousness.\\n', '\\n', 'Also in part III of chapter three, we see how Locke employs consciousness as an\\n', 'awareness of our own mental states to account for different perceptual situations\\n', 'constituting the different “degrees” of certainty of knowledge (intuitive, demonstra-\\n', 'tive, and sensitive) for which Locke is quite famous. Locke’s project in the Essay is to\\n', 'reveal the limits of human understanding by employing the “Historical, plain\\n', 'Method” (I.i.2) of providing a genetic account of knowledge beginning with what\\n', 'is manifest to us when we observe our own thinking. The fulcrum of Locke’s\\n', 'empiricism is the power of introspection to deliver a descriptive analysis of the\\n', 'nature of the mind and its activities without, however, delving into speculation\\n', 'about how ideas are produced either by the motions of bodies affecting our sense\\n', 'organs or in virtue of some sort of mind–body connection.

And\\n', 'more explicitly, in the Third Replies we find “Further, there are other activities, which\\n', 'we call thinking activities, e.g. understanding, willing, imagining, feeling, etc., which\\n', 'agree in falling under the description of thought, perception, or consciousness”\\n', '(CSM II: 124; AT 7: 176). In each of these passages, Descartes seems to be drawing\\n', 'no distinction between consciousness and thinking.29\\n', 'There are other passages, however, which Radner (1988: 440) points to, where\\n', 'Descartes seems to be drawing a distinction between consciousness and thought. For\\n', 'example, in Principles I, 9, Descartes defines thought in terms of consciousness,\\n', 'which suggests that he must mean them to be different, since the one is used to\\n', 'explain the other. Consider thought, he says, as “all those things, which, we being\\n', 'aware [conscious] occur in us, insofar as the awareness [consciousness] of them is in\\n', 'us” (CSM I: 195; AT 8A: 7).

The first type is rudimentary consciousness which is minimally involved in all thinking. The second type is reflexive consciousness. . . . The third type of consciousness is a result of attentive reflection, whereby a person explicitly and deliberately thinks about her thoughts, attends to them, or considers them.” Thiel (2011: 46–8) argues, to the contrary, that “the second-order interpretation of Descartes’ understanding of consciousness is the most plausible one.” Defending Radner or Lähteenmäki against Thiel is not necessary, since my concern is only to show that seeing consciousness as a reflexive constituent of thinking is not only a plausible interpretation, but has a number of adherents.\\n', '\\n', '34 See also Brentano (1973: 123).\\n', '\\n', '35 Alanen (2003: 83) takes thought and consciousness to have different meanings, where “consciousness or immediate awareness [i]s a mark by which mental acts and states qualifying as thoughts are recognized and distinguished from other acts and states.” The reflexivity distinctive of consciousness she describes (p. 100) is similar to Frankfurt’s (1988: 162) description of it as “a sort of immanent reflexivity in virtue of which every instance of being conscious grasps not only that of which it is an awareness but also the awareness of it.”\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'act of thinking of x, which has x as its primary object and itself as its secondary\\n', 'object.” So consciousness as we find it in Descartes’ writings has an ambiguity.

He says, “this (old) problem arises for theories, according to which (1) relating to oneself through consciousness is a mental act distinct from the act to which it relates, and (2) each mental act is simultaneously accompanied by an act of consciousness. If (1) and (2) are accepted, it follows that each act of consciousness is in turn accompanied by another act of consciousness, and so on ad infinitum. . . . Hobbes points out that the problem arises only if consciousness is said to be simultaneous with the act which is its object; and he concludes that knowledge of our own thoughts and actions can relate only to a past, It seems that Descartes, however, does not regard the infinite regress as a problem, as he does not address it in any detail in his response to Hobbes. From the passage in the Conversation with Burman, however, it is clear why the infinite regress is not a problem for him. The soul ‘has the power to reflect on its thoughts as often as it likes, and to be conscious of its thoughts in this way’ because ‘the soul is capable of thinking of more than one thing at the same time, and of continuing with a particular thought which it has.’”\\n', 'Thiel then concludes, “It seems, then, that a second-order interpretation of Descartes’ understanding of consciousness is the most plausible one.” I must confess that I struggle to understand Thiel’s argument.\\n', '\\n', 'Perhaps he is arguing only against Hobbes’s formulation of the regress problem in that if consciousness is not simultaneous with the original perception, which it would not be if it is a second-order act, then the regress is avoided.

As Cudworth explains, conscience “is attributed to rational beings only, and\\n', 'such as are sensible of the discrimen honestorum or turpium when they judge of their\\n', 'own actions according to that rule, and either condemn or acquit themselves.”79\\n', 'Because we attribute actions to ourselves in one form of self-reference and we are\\n', 'capable of measuring those actions to standards of right and wrong in another form\\n', 'of self-reference, we are able to judge (“condemn or acquit”) ourselves, which is a\\n', 'third form of self-reference.80\\n', 'Finally, once there is self-reference by consciousness and reflection, there is also\\n', 'the possibility of self-reference by “self-determination” with respect to action.

Interestingly, Locke and Cudworth can be seen to share this\\n', 'feature of consciousness with Malebranche, although for Locke and for Cudworth,\\n', 'ideas are in our minds, not in God’s. La Forge, Malebranche, Cudworth, and Locke\\n', 'can also be said to share the view that consciousness involves more of a sentiment or\\n', 'feeling than an idea. More importantly, although Locke does not specifically call\\n', 'consciousness a sentiment or feeling, he does say that we cannot think without being\\n', '“sensible of it” and that being sensible of our own thinking is necessary to thinking\\n', '“till we can think without being conscious of it” (II.i.10).\\n', '\\n', 'participating in man’s ethical self-formation instead of being merely some piece or other of discursive reasoning.” She (2014: 312) explains that it is the more fundamental form of self-consciousness, the “to-oneself ”\\n', 'consciousness, that makes us know with certainty, as Cudworth (1838: 193) says, “that there is in us some one hegemonical,” “comprehending all the other powers, energies, and capacities of our soul.” Pécharman (2014: 310) goes on to say that it is this recognition of oneself as “hegemonic” at the most fundamental level that “gives the will its true significance as free will or self-power.” Thus, “The to-oneself consciousness includes the very self-comprehension and self-determination of the soul” (2014: 312).\\n', '\\n', 'Most important to understanding how we should read Locke’s conception of\\n', 'consciousness, however, is its similarity to Descartes’ and Arnauld with respect to\\n', 'the relation between consciousness, first-order thought, and reflection (considered as\\n', 'a distinct act of second-order thought).

Interestingly, though, Caston (2002: 751, 769) argues that Aristotle has a conception of consciousness in which it is a reflexive mental state intrinsic to other mental states and that phenomenal experience is irreducible to representational content.

What results is the\\n', 'view that Locke understands perception in general as having a certain complexity\\n', 'that explains how consciousness carries out the roles Locke either assigns it explicitly\\n', 'or has it doing implicitly in these other aspects of his philosophy.

What we will see is that\\n', 'any knowledge state is a complex mental state that includes agreements or disagree-\\n', 'ments between constituent elements. And when it comes to our knowledge of\\n', 'individual things, consciousness plays an active role in constituting those agree-\\n', 'ments. Part I of chapter three focuses on two cases of knowing a particular thing that\\n', 'receive little attention in Locke scholarship: the intuitive knowledge of our own\\n', 'individual ideas and the intuitive knowledge of ourselves—the latter being Locke’s\\n', 'version of the cogito argument. Once we appreciate that perceptions of ideas are\\n', 'complex mental states, we can see how, for Locke, we can have knowledge consistent\\n', 'with his general definition when we seem to perceive only one idea. One fortuitous\\n', 'consequence of the analysis of how these agreements are constituted is clarification of\\n', 'how we have, as Locke claims, non-inferential knowledge of these individual things\\n', '(both ourselves and ideas), something he leaves relatively obscure. In part II of\\n', 'chapter three, I extend the analysis by providing a structurally similar explanation\\n', 'of the agreement in a case of sensitive knowledge (of the existence of an external\\n', 'object) such that all of Locke’s claims concerning the nature of knowledge in general\\n', 'and the nature of the agreement in sensitive knowledge are accounted for.

And as will be argued, for Locke, the complexity of a perceptual or mental state is not limited to a perceptual act, an idea, and consciousness, although those three elements are always present. In part I of chapter three, we will see that Locke is committed to at least one more constituent of every perceptual state.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'role of consciousness in constituting the agreement known in an instance of sensitive\\n', 'knowledge is what drives Locke to claim it is indeed a form of certain knowledge,\\n', 'albeit with a lesser degree of certainty than what we normally consider knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'From my interpretation of consciousness as a constituent of a more complex\\n', 'perceptual state there results something brand new to Locke scholarship: a structur-\\n', 'ally integrated account of how, for Locke, we have knowledge of individual things\\n', '(our own ideas, ourselves, and external objects) consistent with all of his other\\n', 'commitments.87\\n', 'Consciousness as internal to every mental state also helps to explain, in chapter\\n', 'four, what Locke is up to in his theory of personal identity. I argue that in that chapter\\n', 'of the Essay Locke uses the term ‘consciousness’ ambiguously to mean both the state\\n', 'of awareness of myself as perceiving ideas and the ongoing self I am aware of in those\\n', 'mental states.88 That is, Locke combines a psychological aspect to personal identity\\n', 'with a metaphysical aspect that is not identified with either thinking or bodily\\n', 'substance.

Before showing the role of consciousness in these\\n', 'other aspects of Locke’s philosophy, it will be helpful to look at the interpretive issue\\n', 'of what consciousness is and whether it can fit comfortably in Locke’s model of the\\n', 'mind. Some have thought it cannot. In this chapter, I will review the various options\\n', 'for interpreting consciousness in Locke and the main problems each encounters.\\n', '\\n', 'I will then suggest a way to interpret consciousness that avoids these difficulties, and\\n', 'thus find plenty of room for it in Locke’s philosophical psychology. In recent years\\n', 'there has been significant movement toward interpreting Locke in this way, namely\\n', 'as seeing consciousness as a special kind of reflexive perception—a self-referential,\\n', 'non-evaluative awareness internal to or accompanying ordinary perception.1\\n', 'Historically, in the scholarship, we see three different ways in which consciousness\\n', 'has been thought to fit into Locke’s philosophical psychology. Some have thought\\n', 'that Locke meant to identify consciousness with perception in general. According to this\\n', 'view, all thinking is merely a modification of consciousness, and consciousness plays no\\n', 'independent role in Locke’s theory of the mind.2 Others have suggested that because\\n', 'consciousness involves some kind of awareness of mental states, Locke should be\\n', 'understood as identifying consciousness with reflection.3 Still others have argued that\\n', '1 Weinberg (2008), Coventry and Kriegel (2008), Jorgensen (2014), and Thiel (2011). Balibar (2013: 56) describes consciousness in Locke as an awareness “folding” in on itself that is distinguished from reflection proper. I take this to be similar.\\n', '\\n', '2 For example, Chappell (1994: 27–8), Bolton (2004a: 306), and Rogers (2004: 263). Ayers (1991: I, 288\\n', 'and II, 286) seems to think Locke might have held two conceptions of consciousness at once.\\n', '\\n', '3 For the view that consciousness and reflection in the Essay are the same, see Leibniz (1996: 118); Lee (1702: 40–1); Yolton’s (1956: 73) comments on Lee’s position; Reid (1785: I, v); and Klemmt (1952: 34).\\n', '\\n', 'More recently, LoLordo (2012: 112–22) argues that “consciousness is an intrinsic property of mental states\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'although both entail some sort of awareness of thinking, consciousness and reflection\\n', 'should be understood as different perceptual acts. The distinguishing feature is that\\n', 'reflection seems to require an act of will or attention where consciousness does not.4\\n', 'None of these interpretations of Locke is satisfactory.5 For Locke is attributed either a\\n', 'conception of consciousness insufficient for the role he assigns it or he is interpreted as\\n', 'having a conception that contradicts other important commitments, such as his com-\\n', 'mitment to the paucity of reflective abilities in children or to his empiricist principle that\\n', 'all ideas originate in sensation and reflection.6 The last two problems have led to charges\\n', 'that Locke’s conception of consciousness and reflection are incoherent.7\\n', 'The task is to come up with an interpretation of consciousness that somehow\\n', 'avoids these problems but also takes into account the important contributions\\n', 'consciousness makes to Locke’s theory of the mind and to the rest of his philosophy.\\n', '\\n', 'I argue that Locke can meet all of his commitments as well as avoid any incoherence\\n', 'once consciousness is interpreted as a reflexive self-referential perception internal to\\n', 'any perceptual act. Perceiving an idea is a complex mental state, which includes not\\n', 'only an act of perception and an idea perceived but also the consciousness that I am\\n', 'perceiving the idea.8 In the last chapter, we saw that some of Locke’s predecessors and\\n', 'contemporaries also had problems with formulating a notion of consciousness. From\\n', 'this point onward, I will tackle the problem internally, by focusing on Locke’s use of\\n', 'the term in the Essay. In several places, however, I will point to how Locke’s\\n', 'understanding of consciousness seems to resemble views of his predecessors and\\n', 'seventeenth-century contemporaries as well as more recent and contemporary views.\\n', '\\n', '2.2 Consciousness is Identical to Perception in General\\n', 'Consider first Locke’s definition of consciousness as “the perception of what passes in\\n', 'a Man’s own Mind” (II.i.19). Like Descartes and Arnauld, Locke seems to suggest\\n', 'and that reflection and consciousness are not distinct operations” (116–17). That is, consciousness and reflection refer to the same thing. The difference is that “Reflection is consciousness that is attended to and retained” (119). I hesitate to place LoLordo in this group, since her interpretation is much more complex and nuanced than the others and so escapes many of the problems these others incur. And in many\\n', 'respects LoLordo’s interpretation agrees with mine, which she sees as “roughly correct” (114, n 13).\\n', '\\n', '4 Proponents of the view that consciousness is higher-order awareness different from reflection include Cousin (1873: 79, 102), Gibson (1960: 57), and McRae (1976: 34).\\n', '\\n', '5 LoLordo (2012) is an exception, although I will take issue with her interpretation for other reasons.\\n', '\\n', '6 This is also referred to as Locke’s concept empiricism. See II.i.4: “These two, I say, viz. External, Material things, as the Objects of SENSATION; and the Operations of our own Minds within, as the\\n', 'Objects of REFLECTION, are to me, the only Originals, from whence all our Ideas take their beginnings.”\\n', '7 As Kulstad (1991: 115) notes, both Reid (1785: 127n1) and Cousin (1873: 102) claimed that Locke had either “confounded” (Reid) or “confused” (Cousin) consciousness and reflection, but it is not clearly evident whether the confusion they claim is one of identification or incoherence. See also Ayers (1991: I, 309, n 99), who seems to agree that Locke’s view is incoherent.\\n', '\\n', '8 I interpret consciousness in Locke as self-consciousness. Textually, it is hard to deny, and I do not take there to be much current controversy. Many passages will be cited as evidence in this chapter and\\n', 'elsewhere. What self-consciousness amounts to in Locke will become much clearer as we move forward.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'that consciousness is a perception, and that we are conscious of anything and\\n', 'everything that passes in the mind. But like Malebranche, he is also clear that\\n', 'consciousness is a kind of sensing or awareness of our thinking. “But I do say, he\\n', 'cannot think at any time waking or sleeping, without being sensible of it. Our being\\n', 'sensible of it is not necessary to anything, but to our thoughts; and to them it is;\\n', 'and to them it will always be necessary, till we can think without being conscious\\n', 'of it” (II.i.10). Clearly, Locke understands all thinking to be conscious; it seems that\\n', 'he also understands consciousness to be inseparable from each and every thought,\\n', 'and he seems to think that consciousness provides a particular kind of awareness of\\n', 'our own thinking.\\n', '\\n', 'On the first of the three major interpretations, consciousness is understood to be\\n', 'merely a synonym for perception in general. Perceptual states, according to this view,\\n', 'just are conscious states, and there is no role for consciousness independent of\\n', 'perception. So, when Locke states, as he does on many occasions, that consciousness\\n', 'is necessary or essential to thinking, he is seen as making no distinction between\\n', 'consciousness and perception.9 This interpretation,10 however, cannot do justice to\\n', 'Locke’s understanding of the contributions to perception made by consciousness.\\n', '\\n', 'There is then no way to account for the role of consciousness in Locke’s explanation of\\n', 'memory, his version of Descartes’s cogito argument for the existence of the thinker, or\\n', 'his accounts of sensitive knowledge and personal identity. In each of these accounts,\\n', 'Locke suggests that consciousness adds something to ordinary perception or even that\\n', 'consciousness is a special kind of awareness of a perception. For example, in IV.ii.14,\\n', 'we find Locke asking rhetorically whether one “be not invincibly conscious to himself\\n', 'of a different Perception, when he looks on the Sun by day, and thinks on it by night”\\n', '(my emphasis). Similarly, in II.xxvii.9, Locke seems to say that consciousness is the\\n', 'perception of a perception that in some way grounds our claims to personal identity.\\n', '\\n', 'A ‘person’ is defined as someone who can “consider [him] self as [him] self, . . . which\\n', '[he] does, only by that consciousness, which is inseparable from thinking, and as it\\n', 'seems to me essential to it: It being impossible for any one to perceive, without\\n', 'perceiving, that he does perceive.” Although consciousness is “essential” to perception\\n', 'and inseparable from it, it seems to be responsible for something in addition to\\n', 'perception: say, the awareness that I am the one having the perception.11 Moreover,\\n', 'in each of these accounts Locke clearly seems to distinguish between ‘consciousness’\\n', 'and ‘perception,’ indicating that the terms have different references. In his\\n', '9 For example, in I.ii.5 we find “No Proposition can be said to be in the Mind, which it never yet knew, which it was never yet conscious of,” and in II.i.12, “Whilst [the soul] thinks and perceives, it is capable certainly of those of Delight or Trouble, as well as any other Perceptions; and it must necessarily be conscious of its own Perceptions.” Other passages asserting the necessary relation between consciousness and thinking or perception include II.i.11, II.i.18, and II.xxvii.9.\\n', '\\n', '10 In the last chapter we saw that a similar issue arises in Descartes. As noted there, the majority of translators maintain a distinction between consciousness and thinking in Descartes by translating cogitatio or pensée as ‘thought’ and conscientia or conscience as ‘consciousness’ or ‘awareness.’\\n', '11 See also II.xxvii.16 and II.xxvii.24.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'endorsement of the cogito, to give another example, Locke can be understood to\\n', 'delineate consciousness from perception in general when he writes, “In every Act of\\n', 'Sensation, Reasoning, or Thinking, we are conscious to our selves of our own Being;\\n', 'and, in this Matter, come not short of the highest degree of Certainty” (IV.ix.3). Along\\n', 'with the act of thinking is consciousness that I am the thinker.\\n', '\\n', 'Even more troublesome, identifying consciousness with perception fails to\\n', 'acknowledge the importance of consciousness in one of Locke’s most cogent argu-\\n', 'ments against innate ideas.12 That argument runs roughly as follows. Innate ideas, if\\n', 'not yet perceived, must somehow be already in the mind prior to any new ideas\\n', 'originating in either sensation or reflection. But, for Locke, ideas that are in the mind\\n', 'but not presently perceived are experienced as memories. So, just as we can tell the\\n', 'difference between a new idea and a memory, to claim that we have innate ideas\\n', 'requires that we can also identify them as somehow different from memories. How\\n', 'we identify an idea as a memory, for Locke, is through the conscious perception of it.\\n', '\\n', 'Experiencing ideas as having been in the mind before consists in the mind’s “Power . . . to\\n', 'revive Perceptions, which it once had, with this additional Perception annexed to\\n', 'them, that it has had them before” (II.x.2). That Locke sees consciousness as this\\n', '“additional annexed perception” is evident when he says, “This consciousness of\\n', 'its [the idea’s] having been in the mind before, being that, which distinguishes\\n', 'Remembring from all other ways of Thinking” (I.iv.20). Thus, the argument that\\n', 'there are innate ideas rests on answering Locke’s challenge to show that we have ideas\\n', 'that are experienced as neither new to the mind nor as memories. Therefore, to\\n', 'understand consciousness as identical to perception in general is to ignore Locke’s\\n', 'explicit claim that consciousness does additional work in distinguishing or singling\\n', 'out memories as memories, and therefore to ignore the essential role consciousness\\n', 'plays in Locke’s first-line defense of empiricism. Those who equate consciousness\\n', 'with perception seem to pass by this issue altogether.13\\n', '2.2.1 Consciousness is identical to reflection\\n', 'Another way to interpret Locke is to attribute to him the view that consciousness\\n', 'contributes something to perception as some sort of second-order awareness of\\n', 'perceptions.14 This is consistent with his claim that all thinking is conscious and\\n', 'with consciousness being a perception of a perception.15 Assigning to Locke the view\\n', 'that consciousness is a higher-order perceptual state in which we are aware of our\\n', '12 Atherton (1998: 51) argues that because of the “strong connection between ‘being in the mind’ and\\n', '‘being in consciousness,’ ” Locke’s arguments against innate ideas are not trivial.\\n', '\\n', '13 An exception is Ayers (1991: I, 288), who, nevertheless, recognizes the cogency of my line of\\n', 'argumentation. On his view, Locke should have identified consciousness with perception to accommodate his imagism but could not, because, for Locke, “the intrinsic intentional content of conscious thought typically goes beyond the intrinsic intentional content of the sensations and images involved in it.”\\n', '14 All those mentioned in notes 3 (Leibniz et al.), 4 (Cousin et al.), and 7 (Kulstad et al.) take the view that consciousness is a second-order awareness of perceptions.\\n', '\\n', '15 Note that a regress looms. This issue will be addressed shortly.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'own thinking, however, gives rise to a difficulty for Locke with respect to what he says\\n', 'in the following passage:\\n', 'For the Objects of our Senses, do, many of them, obtrude their particular Ideas upon our\\n', 'minds, whether we will or no: And the Operations of our minds, will not let us be without, at\\n', 'least some obscure Notions of them. No Man, can be wholly ignorant of what he does when he\\n', 'thinks. These simple Ideas, when offered to the mind, the Understanding can no more refuse to\\n', 'have, nor alter, when they are imprinted, nor blot them out, and make new ones in it self, than\\n', 'a mirror can refuse, alter, or obliterate the Images or Ideas, which, the Objects set before it, do therein produce.\\n', '\\n', '(II.i.25)\\n', 'The problem for this interpretation is that consciousness, as an awareness of our\\n', 'thinking, results in the “obscure Notions” mentioned here. Arriving at this conclu-\\n', 'sion relies on the textual interpretation that when Locke asserts that we are never\\n', '“wholly ignorant of what [we] do when we think,” he should be understood to mean,\\n', '“No man can be wholly ignorant of the particular thing he does at a moment when he\\n', 'thinks in a particular way” (Kulstad 1991: 111).16 This interpretation suggests that we\\n', 'have a particular idea of the thinking we perceive within ourselves, and the reason\\n', 'why it must be a particular idea is that “the Understanding can no more refuse to have\\n', '[those simple ideas offered to it] . . . , than a mirror can refuse . . . the Images, . . . which,\\n', 'the Objects set before it, do therein produce” (II.i.25). Therefore, this passage is\\n', 'understood to be saying that the reason I am not ignorant of what I am doing when\\n', 'I am thinking is that I have a particular idea of my thinking. But if consciousness is\\n', 'responsible for ideas of my thinking, and ideas of my thinking are ideas of reflection,\\n', 'then, as Kulstad (1991) and others have argued, we should understand Locke to be\\n', 'identifying consciousness and reflection.17 Thus, conscious states are reflective states,\\n', 'which means that any mental state emerging as the result of consciousness is the result\\n', 'of a second-order reflective act.\\n', '\\n', '16 Kulstad (1991: 111, n 62) justifies this interpretation in the following way: “It may be thought that I have misconstrued Locke here. Since the point is important, let’s consider a bit more carefully a crucial sentence: ‘No man can be wholly ignorant of what he does when he thinks.’ This would seem to be open to at least two different interpretations, which can be roughly formulated as follows:\\n', '(1) No man can be wholly ignorant of the particular thing he does at a moment when he thinks in a\\n', 'particular way.\\n', '\\n', '(2) No man can be wholly ignorant of the general sort of thing he does when he thinks.\\n', '\\n', 'I judge that interpretation (1) is correct. For in the sentence following immediately after the one presently under discussion, Locke says that a mind cannot refuse simple ideas offered to the mind any more than a ‘mirror can refuse . . . images . . . which the objects set before it do therein produce.’ It seems to me that a person who had no idea of the particular mental operation he or she was performing at the moment would in effect be refusing an idea set before the mind . . . Given this point, I view Locke’s statement, that ‘the operation of our minds will not let us be without, at least, some obscure notions of them,’ to mean that any time there is an operation in our minds we acquire at least an obscure idea of it.\\n', '\\n', 'I assume that, for Locke, this idea is acquired by our perception of the operation, which perception must be present, since there is nothing in the mind of which we are not conscious.”\\n', '17 Those in note 3 (Leibniz et al.).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Here comes the difficulty presented in the preceding quotation (II.i.25) from Locke\\n', 'to this line of interpretation. Should Locke be interpreted as seeing consciousness\\n', 'identical to reflection, he runs into trouble reconciling consciousness with his claims\\n', 'concerning the reflective abilities of young children. In II.i.8 he admits that children\\n', 'might have “floating Visions,” namely some perception of their own thinking; yet he\\n', 'explicitly denies that children can reflect:\\n', 'And hence we see the reason, why ’tis pretty late, before most Children get Ideas of the\\n', 'Operations of their own Minds; and some have not very clear, or perfect Ideas of the greatest\\n', 'part of them all their Lives. Because, though they pass there continually; yet like floating\\n', 'Visions, they make not deep Impressions enough, to leave in the Mind clear and distinct lasting\\n', 'Ideas, until the Understanding turns inwards upon it self, reflects on its own Operations, and\\n', 'makes them the Object of its own Contemplation.\\n', '\\n', '(II.i.8)\\n', 'The “obscure Notions” in II.i.25 and perhaps also the “floating Visions” in II.i.8\\n', 'must be due to consciousness. But if they are, and consciousness and reflection are\\n', 'the same mental act, then Locke contradicts his claim in II.i.8 that young children,\\n', 'though conscious, do not reflect.18 In Locke’s defense it seems unlikely he would\\n', 'make this mistake. The lack of reflective abilities in young children is important to\\n', 'his commitment to reflection as a more mature kind of thinking. Since reflection is\\n', 'a higher-level thinking about perceptions of ideas that leads to clearer and more\\n', 'distinct ideas concerning our mental operations, it is likely that Locke thought\\n', 'young children are incapable of gaining those ideas necessary to higher forms of\\n', 'knowledge.19\\n', 'Finally, if consciousness is understood to be reflective, namely a higher-order\\n', 'perception, then Locke’s theory of consciousness also entails a regress of perceptions.\\n', '\\n', 'All thinking, for Locke, is conscious, and consciousness is thought to be some sort of\\n', 'perception of a perception. It follows that if consciousness bears a relation to ideas\\n', 'that produces more ideas, then any perception by consciousness results in a mental\\n', 'state that must itself be perceived by consciousness. This results in another mental\\n', 'state of which we must be conscious, and so on. In fact, in the II.xxvii.9 passage\\n', 'already noted Locke surprisingly seems to imply such a regress. When Locke says\\n', 'that “consciousness . . . is inseparable from thinking, and as it seems to me essential to\\n', 'it,” and then goes on to say that it is “impossible for any one to perceive without\\n', 'perceiving, that he does perceive,” it is clear that he must intend ‘perceiving’ to be\\n', 'synonymous with ‘consciousness.’ Therefore, if the way in which we perceive in being\\n', 'conscious is identified with the way in which we perceive in reflection, then the\\n', 'regress is unavoidable. It is hard to imagine Locke espousing such a view.\\n', '\\n', '18 LoLordo (2012) is an exception.

This requires that we see\\n', 'the perception of an idea as a complex mental state that includes being conscious that\\n', 'we are perceiving the idea. Therefore, constituent in each perception of an idea is the\\n', 'idea perceived, as well as the consciousness of ourselves as perceiving it. For Locke,\\n', 'every act of perception has an object—an idea, namely that toward which we are\\n', 'attending in the perceiving.

Moreover, it is possible that\\n', 'Locke’s account of the complexity in perceiving ideas involves more than an act of\\n', 'perception, an idea perceived, and the self-consciousness that I am perceiving. In later\\n', 'chapters, I will defend the view that there is another constituent of the complex\\n', 'mental state that is the perception of any idea, which allows that we have different\\n', 'forms of knowledge as the result of perceiving an idea: We have intuitive knowledge\\n', 'of the idea and of our own existence, and when we perceive an occurrent idea of\\n', 'sensation, we have sensitive knowledge. In these cases, seeing perceptions of ideas as\\n', 'complex mental states that include consciousness, as well as other elements, allows\\n', 'Locke to hold the view, for which there is significant textual evidence, that we have\\n', 'certain forms of knowledge as the result of perceiving an idea.23 Importantly for now,\\n', 'because consciousness is understood as a self-referential constituent of ordinary\\n', 'perception, it is not an additional mental act above and beyond the original perception.\\n', '\\n', 'And if it is not an additional mental act, then it can be a “perception of [every]\\n', 'perception”—namely an additional mental element—and yet not be seen as a source\\n', 'of ideas.\\n', '\\n', '22 Simmons (Unpublished) notes that when describing consciousness Locke uses the preposition “to”\\n', 'instead of “of.” I am conscious to myself, rather than conscious of something.

La Forge accounts for conscience explicitly in terms of an inherent reflexivity of thought itself, rather than as a second-order act of perception. Arnauld makes the same point by explaining consciousness in terms of a réflexion virtuelle, as distinct from a réflexion expresse; that is to say in terms of the notion that ‘our thought or perception is essentially reflective on itself ’ (Arnauld, Des vrayes et des fausses idéees (1683), chapt.6, p. 46.) . . . Also, consciousness for Locke is to be understood as ‘creature consciousness’. It is not the perception that is conscious, but the subject of thought.” Thiel would disagree that Descartes should be included on this list.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'reading Locke’s view of consciousness as not falling into the same trap as Brentano, for\\n', 'consciousness need not take the perception it is intrinsic to as an object.27\\n', 'Furthermore, it does not follow necessarily that in being conscious I am perceiving;\\n', 'the sort of awareness I have of myself entails that consciousness takes the self as\\n', 'an object. According to Sartre (1956), self-consciousness can be both reflective and\\n', 'pre-reflective. When consciousness is pre-reflective, we are aware of ourselves as\\n', 'having mental states, but we are not aware of ourselves thematically—not, say, as\\n', 'objects. To know ourselves in this way would require a further act of reflection on\\n', 'that of which we are pre-reflectively conscious. Sartre (1956: liii) says, “it is the non-\\n', 'reflective consciousness which renders the reflection possible; there is a pre-reflective\\n', 'cogito which is the condition of the Cartesian cogito.” Therefore, also with respect to\\n', 'self-consciousness phenomenologists would deny that there is a subject–object\\n', 'relation involved in being pre-reflectively conscious.

And, like Sartre, Locke would require an\\n', 'additional act of reflection in order to perceive an idea of myself. Locke can also be\\n', 'seen to include a distinction like Sartre’s between a pre-reflective consciousness giving\\n', 'us an implicit awareness of ourselves as perceiving and a later reflection (as Locke\\n', 'understands it) on consciousness that results in a full-fledged idea of the self.29\\n', 'Although I will have more to say about how later phenomenological theories can be\\n', 'used to understand the role of consciousness in various aspects of Locke’s philosophy,\\n', 'the point here is simply to try to orient my interpretation of Locke within more\\n', 'contemporary views and maybe to gesture toward a way in which Locke shared\\n', 'similar insights.30 Moreover, given the continuities with current scholarship, this\\n', 'interpretation of Locke’s conception of consciousness can be seen to have more\\n', 'than antiquarian interest. But let me be clear that I am not anachronistically claiming\\n', 'that the similarities to later phenomenological theories are evidence that Locke held\\n', 'the view I attribute to him.\\n', '\\n', '28 Focal inner awareness resembles Locke’s understanding of reflection, which is arguably second-order, voluntary, requires attention, and results in ideas (II.i.4, II.i.7, II.i.8).\\n', '\\n', '29 I will have more to say about Locke’s version of the cogito argument in chapter 3, part I.\\n', '\\n', '30 For a philosopher outside the phenomenological tradition that espouses such a view, see Alvin\\n', 'Goldman (1970: 96): “[Consider] the case of thinking about x or attending to x. In the process of thinking about x there is already an implicit awareness that one is thinking about x. There is no need for reflection here, for taking a step back from thinking about x in order to examine it. . . . When we are thinking about x, the mind is focused on x, not on our thinking of x. Nevertheless, the process of thinking about x carries with it a non-reflective self-awareness.” See, again, also James (1961). Seeing the distinction between consciousness and reflection in this sort of way commits me to the view that reflection, for Locke, is not a passive operation. As Locke says, it requires “attention” (II.i.7–8). But the attention required need only be slight, and might be hardly noticeable. Weinberg (2008), Coventry and Kriegel (2008), and (so by agreement) Thiel (2011) are similarly committed owing to their arguments providing both textual and philosophical\\n', 'coherence to Locke’s claims about the relation of consciousness to ordinary perception and reflection.\\n', '\\n', '(I think Thiel, however, would disagree that consciousness is a phenomenological sort of self-\\n', 'consciousness.) It would also be interesting to look at how Locke’s understanding of the relation of consciousness to perception stands up to what Sidney Shoemaker (1996: 224) has called the “perceptual model of self-knowledge.” That Locke’s view shares some features with later theories is not meant to be evidence for my interpretation of Locke’s conception of consciousness. I mention the similarities merely to help any reader familiar with contemporary work on consciousness (as well as those not so familiar) to get a better handle on what I see in Locke and the experience of our own thinking that he was attempting to capture in his employment of consciousness in various arguments in the Essay.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'I have proposed a reading of Locke that allows consciousness to be a perception of\\n', 'every perception (all thinking) without also being a source of ideas. But how does this\\n', 'interpretation square with the passages in II.i.25 and II.i.8? An advantage to reading\\n', 'Locke’s conception of consciousness in this way is that it solves the interpretive\\n', 'problem posed by these passages, because we no longer have to understand Locke\\n', 'as equating the “obscure Notions” in II.i.25 and the “floating Visions” in II.i.8 with\\n', 'ideas of reflection. Instead, they can be seen to refer to the conscious awareness\\n', 'internal to the perception of the ideas in question.31 The reason is that although\\n', 'Locke is clear that we are conscious of each and every mental state, he does not think\\n', 'that we reflect every time we have a mental state.32 He is very clear that young children\\n', 'have mental states but they do not engage in reflection (II.i.8). Therefore, the fact that\\n', 'we are never ignorant of our thinking need not mean that we must have reflected and\\n', 'thereby produced ideas of that thinking. Rather, we can be aware of ourselves as\\n', 'thinking (or better, that we are thinking) simply in virtue of consciousness. Moreover,\\n', 'as we saw in II.i.8, Locke thinks that mental operations “pass continually” in the minds\\n', 'of children; yet there are no clear and distinct ideas of those mental operations until\\n', '“the Understanding turns inwards upon it self ” and reflects on them. Locke’s point is\\n', 'that the impressions made by the operations of the mind about the ideas of sensation33\\n', 'it has do not yield ideas until the mind is capable of turning in on itself and reflecting.\\n', '\\n', 'Children, therefore, can have vague notions of their mental states—that they are\\n', 'having them—without having ideas of the nature of the mental operations involved in\\n', 'having those mental states. But if the “obscure Notions” in II.i.25 and the vague\\n', '“floating Visions” in II.i.8 are not ideas of mental operations due to reflection, then\\n', '31 See Scharp (2008: 38ff) for a different explanation of how we can have mental operations passing\\n', '“continually in the mind” yet not have ideas of reflection. He argues that Locke’s theory of reflection includes the existence of “mental impressions,” which are “mental entities” distinct from, yet the result of, mental operations. Thus, reflecting on (perception of ) “mental impressions” rather than reflecting on (perception of ) mental operations gives rise to ideas of reflection. He concludes that “the most plausible interpretation” is that when Locke claims that we are conscious (aware) of “what passes in a Man’s own Mind” (II.i.19), he does not mean to include mental operations, since we can have mental operations of which we are unaware. Our lack of awareness, namely the failure to perceive an idea of reflection, is due to our failure to reflect on the mental impression. “Otherwise,” argues Scharp (2008: 42), “if Locke allows mental operations to count as that which passes in a mind [as that which gives rise to the idea perceived], then he is committed to the claim that one can be conscious of a mental operation even if one is unaware of it (e.g., in cases where the mental operation does not give rise to an idea).” “This result,” continues Scharp\\n', '“seems counterintuitive.” I suggest, however, that if we understand that consciousness, for Locke, is an awareness of mental activity that does not give rise to ideas of reflection, then we can reconcile Locke’s claim that we are conscious of mental operations (all that passes in the mind), but we do not have\\n', 'corresponding ideas of reflection. And we can do it without attributing to Locke’s theory the existence of additional mental entities.\\n', '\\n', '32 McRae (1976: 34–5) takes this view: “[f]or both [Descartes and Locke] there are no thoughts and\\n', 'perceptions in the mind of which it is not conscious, although there may be much in the mind which is not reflected upon, thought about, or given any attention.”\\n', '33 Locke generally uses this somewhat misleading formulation (“about the ideas . . . it has”) to describe the relation between the mental operation (perception) and its object (ideas). See, for example, II.i.23 and II.ix.1.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'what are they? Perhaps we should see them as consciousness, which is a reflexive and\\n', 'self-referential (even if vague) awareness of ourselves as thinking internal to the\\n', 'perceptions of the ideas. The result is that II.i.25 and II.i.8 are not problematic for\\n', 'Locke at all. In fact, they are evidence that Locke can consistently claim that we can be\\n', 'conscious that we are thinking, that is “Consciousness is the perception of what passes\\n', 'in a man’s own mind” (II.i.19), and at the same time not be producing any new ideas.\\n', '\\n', '2.3.1 An objection and replies\\n', 'Locke tells us in I.i.8 that ‘idea’ is used “to express whatever is meant by Phantasm,\\n', 'Notion, Species, or whatever it is, which the Mind can be employ’d about in thinking.”\\n', 'Why, then, should we not understand the “obscure Notions” from II.i.25 as ideas of\\n', 'reflection? The first thing to say in reply is that II.i.25 is a very puzzling passage and\\n', 'therefore not the best one on which to hang an interpretation that contradicts some\\n', 'of Locke’s most closely held commitments such as the empiricist principle or the lack\\n', 'of reflective abilities in young children. Indeed, a closer reading of the passage from\\n', 'II.i.25 reveals the answer to the objection.34\\n', 'When Locke says that “the Operations of our minds will not let us be without, at\\n', 'least some obscure Notions of them” he is talking about our perceptions of ideas as\\n', 'the result of sensation. What becomes clear is that II.i.25 is not at all about reflection,\\n', 'but about sensation. The “obscure Notions” should be understood as consciousness\\n', 'of perceptions caused by the “Objects of our Senses [that] . . . obtrude their particular\\n', 'Ideas upon our minds” (II.i.25). And the fact that we are conscious of our perceptions\\n', 'involving sensations—namely, perceptions of ideas of sensation—does not imply\\n', 'that in being conscious of these perceptions we have additional ideas of mental\\n', 'operations, or ideas of reflection. Thus, the obtruding ideas are from objects of the\\n', 'senses, and what is unavoidable is our perception of them. But to perceive ideas of\\n', 'sensation is to think, and Locke is clear that all thinking is conscious. So, the idea\\n', 'of sensation is the object of the perception, while the “obscure Notions” constitute\\n', 'the consciousness that I am perceiving it. The “obscure Notions” are unavoidable,\\n', 'asserts Locke, because consciousness is internal to every perception; it is a reflexive\\n', 'awareness of myself as perceiving an idea. Therefore, it is impossible to be wholly\\n', 'ignorant—to have no awareness at all—of what we are doing when we think, namely,\\n', 'when we have those perceptions of ideas caused by external objects.35 Consciousness\\n', 'as intrinsic to the act of perception provides a fundamental first-personal experience\\n', '34 Again, the relevant passage reads: “For the Objects of our Senses, do, many of them, obtrude their particular Ideas upon our minds, whether we will or no: And the Operations of our minds, will not let us be without, at least some obscure Notions of them. No Man, can be wholly ignorant of what he does when he thinks. These simple Ideas, when offered to the mind, the Understanding can no more refuse to have, nor alter, when they are imprinted, nor blot them out, and make new ones in it self, than a mirror can refuse, alter, or obliterate the Images or Ideas, which, the Objects set before it, do therein produce” (II.i.25).\\n', '\\n', '35 See II.xix.1 for Locke’s claim that in sensation, ideas are furnished in the mind when the mental operation of perception is “annexed to any impression on the Body, made by an external Object.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'or sense that I am thinking.36 In the mirror analogy, then, Locke is saying that the\\n', 'ideas are the images in the mirror that I cannot help but see, and the “obscure Notions”\\n', 'constitute my awareness that I am looking in a mirror. Therefore, the “obscure\\n', 'Notions” are better understood not as ideas at all, but as consciousness that is\\n', 'constituent of every ordinary perception.\\n', '\\n', 'In order to account for the content of consciousness in a way consistent with the\\n', 'I.i.8 definition of ideas, in earlier work, I argued that we might see Locke as making\\n', 'a technical distinction between “ideas” and something like “notions.”37 I no longer\\n', 'think an argument or distinction of this kind is necessary or even warranted, for the\\n', 'content of consciousness need not be seen as an object of consciousness. In agreement\\n', 'with my analysis of consciousness as a reflexive constituent of any perception and with\\n', 'my analysis of the passage from II.i.25 in my earlier work, Thiel (2011) offers an\\n', 'amendment explaining why the content of consciousness need not be seen as con-\\n', 'flicting with Locke’s I.i.8 claim about ideas. Because consciousness is an intrinsic\\n', 'feature of perception, it need not be structurally identical to ordinary perceptions like\\n', 'sensation or reflection. Here is how Thiel (2011: 116) replies to the objection:\\n', 'But what about the objection that such a direct relation of consciousness to mental states and\\n', 'operations means that there are for Locke objects of thought and experience that are not\\n', 'ideas—which would contradict Locke’s thesis that ideas are the only objects of thought and\\n', 'experience? The problem with this objection is that it conceives of mental states and operations\\n', 'as objects of consciousness in the same way as such objects and states are objects of reflection. . . .\\n', '\\n', 'Locke thinks of the relationship between consciousness and thought in a different way.\\n', '\\n', 'Thinking and other mental operations are not ‘objects’ that are somehow separate from\\n', 'consciousness; rather they are characterized by an inherent reflexivity which Locke calls\\n', 'consciousness (rather than reflection).

But the difficulty with this interpretation is that, again, one might\\n', '38 Although “’tis pretty late” before children have ideas of reflection, they do have “floating visions” of their own thinking (II.i.8 cited above), or what I think Locke also calls “obscure Notions.”\\n', '39 See II.i.9 and II.ix.1, where Locke equates ‘perception’ with ‘having ideas’ and with ‘thinking.’\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'think we run up against the problem that consciousness produces ideas, and therefore,\\n', 'we cannot reconcile the fact that Locke is clearly committed to the empiricist principle\\n', 'that ideas are produced only in sensation and reflection. So, instead, I suggest the\\n', 'passage is better interpreted in the following way: We are conscious that we are having\\n', 'mental operations prior to reflecting on them and thus producing ideas of reflection—\\n', 'this just is Locke’s view that we are conscious of all that passes in the mind—of all of\\n', 'our own thinking. And when we “observe in ourselves” (reflect on) those (conscious)\\n', 'operations, we end up perceiving (producing) ideas of reflection that have those\\n', 'conscious operations as their objects. Of course, we will also be conscious that we\\n', 'are having those acts of reflection. Remember that mental operations are always about\\n', 'ideas, and they are in the mind only as they involve ideas originating in sensation or\\n', 'reflection. So, every mental operation that passes in the mind is a perception of some\\n', 'sort, and because consciousness is an internal constituent of all perception, we are\\n', 'conscious that we are perceiving prior to reflecting on and having ideas of those\\n', 'mental operations. Therefore, this passage is actually consistent with the interpret-\\n', 'ation offered here: because being conscious is an intrinsic feature of perception and\\n', 'not structurally identical to perception, consciousness can be distinguished from\\n', 'reflection without contradicting Locke’s empiricist principle.\\n', '\\n', '2.4 The Relation Consciousness Bears to Perception\\n', 'We must acknowledge that there is an ambiguity in Locke’s uses of ‘perception’ and\\n', '‘perceiving.’ It is not an entirely settled matter whether Locke equates ‘perception’\\n', 'with ‘idea.’40 And it is not readily clear how to cash out the relation consciousness\\n', 'bears to perception. Although reflection and sensation are different in that having\\n', 'ideas of sensation involves perception as the result of bodily impressions and\\n', 'having ideas of reflection involves perception of mental operations, both sensation\\n', 'and reflection produce ideas. In contrast, consciousness does not produce ideas,\\n', 'but at the same time, consciousness, like sensation and reflection, has something\\n', 'to do with perception. So, how does Locke see the relation of consciousness to\\n', 'perception?\\n', '\\n', 'Locke does not devote a specific chapter to an explication of consciousness, but it\\n', 'is important to note that neither does he do so with sensation or reflection. He does,\\n', '40 Sometimes by ‘perception’ Locke seems to mean the act of perceiving and other times the idea\\n', 'produced (as the result of sensation or reflection). In the latter case, Locke will usually, if not always, use the upper-case ‘Perception.’ I think the confusion is exacerbated by interpreting Locke as meaning ‘idea’ by\\n', '‘perception’ without at the same time clarifying the difference between the bare mental act of perception and the idea produced in perceiving something, which is a conceptual distinction for Locke, not one we experience. See, for example, Yolton (1984: 88–94), who interprets Locke as using ‘perception’ and ‘idea’\\n', 'interchangeably. Chappell (1994: 27–8) argues that although Locke’s usage of the terms is sometimes ambiguous, he never means by ‘idea’ an act of perception as opposed to the object of such an act.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'however, treat all three in various places in II.i. Let us review three of these passages\\n', 'concerning first, sensation, then, reflection, and last, consciousness:\\n', 'If it shall be demanded then, When a Man begins to have any Ideas? I think, the true Answer is,\\n', 'When he first has a Sensation. For since there appear not to be any Ideas in the Mind, before\\n', 'the Senses have conveyed any in, I conceive that Ideas in the Understanding, are coeval with\\n', 'Sensation; which is such an Impression or Motion, made in some part of the Body, as\\n', 'produces some Perception in the Understanding. ’Tis about these Impressions made on our\\n', 'Senses by outward Objects, that the Mind seems first to employ it self in such Operations as we\\n', 'call Perception, Remembring, Consideration, Reasoning, etc.\\n', '\\n', '(II.i.23, my emphasis in bold)\\n', 'The other Fountain, from which Experience furnisheth the Understanding with Ideas, is the\\n', 'Perception of the Operations of our own Minds within us, as it is employ’d about the Ideas it\\n', 'has got; which Operations, when the Soul comes to reflect on, and consider, do furnish the\\n', 'Understanding with another set of Ideas, which could not be had from things without: and\\n', 'such are, Perception, Thinking, Doubting, Believing, Reasoning, Knowing, Willing, and all the\\n', 'different actings of our own Minds; which we being conscious of, and observing in our selves,\\n', 'do from these receive into our understandings, as distinct Ideas, as we do from Bodies affecting\\n', 'our Senses.\\n', '\\n', '(II.i.4, my emphasis in bold)\\n', 'For ’tis altogether as intelligible to say, that a body is extended without parts, as that any thing thinks without being conscious of it, or perceiving, that it does so. They who talk thus, may, with as much reason, if it be necessary to their Hypothesis, say that a man is always hungry, but that\\n', 'he does not always feel it: Whereas Hunger consists in that very sensation, as thinking\\n', 'consists in being conscious that one thinks. If they say that a Man is always conscious to\\n', 'himself of thinking; I ask how they know it? Consciousness is the Perception of what passes\\n', 'in a Man’s own Mind. (II.i.19, my emphasis in bold)\\n', 'Note that in the passage on sensation (II.i.23) and in the one on reflection (II.i.4)\\n', 'Locke’s explanation focuses on the production of ideas or the furnishing of ideas in\\n', 'the understanding either by sensation or reflection. In sensation, an impression on\\n', 'the body caused by an external object “produces some Perception in the Under-\\n', 'standing” (II.i.23). Presumably, the motions from the impression on the body travel\\n', 'through the nervous system to the mind, where they produce in the understanding a\\n', 'perception of an idea of the external object. That is the process by which we gain ideas of\\n', 'sensation. In reflection, the mind turns in on the ideas (mostly) from sensation it already\\n', 'has and perceives the thinking operations involved in having those ideas. When the\\n', 'mind “comes to reflect on and consider” those ideas it already has, the operations of the\\n', 'mind “do furnish the Understanding with another set of Ideas,” namely, ideas of\\n', 'reflection. The ideas “furnished” to the mind in reflection are the result of perceptions\\n', 'of the operations of our minds as they are “employ’d about the Ideas it [the mind] has\\n', 'got.” It is clear from these two passages that sensation and reflection are mental acts or\\n', 'operations that furnish or produce additional ideas in the understanding.41\\n', '41 See II.i.24 for parallel descriptions of how perception is required for an impression from the senses to yield an idea of sensation or for an impression on the mind from reflecting on a mental operation to yield an idea of reflection. Consciousness, however, is a mental state that is not itself perceived.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'In contrast, Locke describes the awareness involved in consciousness much\\n', 'differently—most obviously, he does not use words like ‘furnish’ or ‘produce.’ This\\n', 'in itself suggests that Locke does not intend consciousness to furnish or produce ideas.\\n', '\\n', 'Rather, to explain the relation consciousness bears to perception, Locke employs an\\n', 'analogy, primarily to the relation between hunger and feeling hungry. Although\\n', 'the analogy is not strict, it suggests that Locke understands the relation con-\\n', 'sciousness bears to perception as having similar aspects to the relation feeling\\n', 'hungry bears to being hungry. Being hungry, Locke says, consists in feeling\\n', 'hungry: what it is like for me to be hungry is not additional to having hunger.\\n', '\\n', 'Analogously, consciousness is not something additional to thinking or having\\n', 'ideas; being conscious (in some way) just is what it means for me to be thinking.\\n', '\\n', 'On the other hand, consciousness is not identical to perception: it is one\\n', 'component of the overall complex mental act of perceiving an idea rather\\n', 'than all that thinking consists in. Analogously, there is more to hunger, say,\\n', 'physiological aspects, than just feeling hungry. On this model, consciousness—as\\n', 'non-productive of ideas and as analogous to the points made about hunger—is\\n', 'best explained as something different from perception but internal to it, perhaps,\\n', 'as my experience of myself as thinking.42\\n', 'In many places, Locke seems to indicate that consciousness is self-consciousness or\\n', 'some sort of experience of our thinking as our own. The following examples make\\n', 'up just a few of many: “Every Man being conscious to himself, That he thinks . . .”\\n', '(II.i.1); “If the Soul doth think in a sleeping Man, without being conscious of it, I ask,\\n', 'whether, during such thinking, it has any Pleasure or Pain, or be capable of\\n', 'Happiness or Misery? . . . For to be happy or miserable without being conscious of\\n', 'it, seems to me utterly inconsistent and impossible” (II.i.11), and “For since\\n', 'consciousness always accompanies thinking, and ’tis that, that makes everyone to\\n', 'be, what he calls self; and thereby distinguishes himself from all other thinking\\n', 'things” (II.xxvii.9). Again, just because consciousness is not an independent\\n', 'mental act does not mean that consciousness is not a constituent of a more complex\\n', '42 Mackie (1976: 180–3) and Winkler (1998: 153ff) argue that, for Locke, in being conscious we are\\n', 'aware of an I thinking. Issues concerning the experience we have of ourselves in virtue of being conscious of perceptions of ideas are considered in chapters three, four, and five. It is also important to note that the early moderns who employ a notion of self-consciousness in addition to perception would have generally\\n', 'attributed the phenomenal quality of ideas to perception. Simmons (unpublished) explains, “It’s not that the early moderns had no concept answering to what we might describe as outer-directed object-consciousness. They just would not, by and large, have called it ‘consciousness.’ . . . [O]bject-consciousness would have gone by the name ‘perception.’ It’s true . . . that some philosophers of the period insist that perception entails consciousness in one way or another . . . so that you cannot have a perception without being conscious to yourself of the perception. But the perception and consciousness are not one and the same thing. What about the ‘what it’s like’ or phenomenology of object-perception so popular today? Some historians deny the early moderns had any such notion. I think it’s better simply to say that that’s not what consciousness is primarily about for them. There’s no reason to deny that the early moderns think object perception has a phenomenology; indeed there are good reasons to think they do. The fact that perception and consciousness are generally thought to co-occur, though, makes it difficult to know whether the phenomenology or what-it’s-like of object-perception is due to perception or due to our consciousness of it.”\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'mental act. Locke understands consciousness to consist in a special kind of awareness,\\n', 'perhaps one that provides some sort of grasp of ourselves and of our perceptions as\\n', 'ours. But in order to be consistent, it must be an awareness that is different from the\\n', 'perception involved in sensation and reflection.\\n', '\\n', 'At this point one might wonder about the implications of this interpretation for\\n', 'animals. Locke is clear that animals have perception: “This faculty of Perception, seems\\n', 'to be that, which puts the distinction betwixt the animal Kingdom, and the inferior parts\\n', 'of Nature” (II.ix.11). Plants, on the other hand do not have perception; the sensitivity of\\n', 'plants to the motions of other bodies, Locke says, “is all bare Mechanism” (II.ix.11). But\\n', 'if animals have perception, then on my interpretation they are conscious and even to\\n', 'some degree self-conscious. Although this might sound odd, Locke does not seem to\\n', 'think so. On the contrary, he seems to think that by and large the mental capacities of\\n', 'animals are like those of human beings, except in matter of degree:\\n', 'Perception, I believe, is, in some degree, in all sorts of Animals; though in some possibly, the\\n', 'Avenues, provided by Nature for the reception of Sensations, are so few, and the perception\\n', 'they are received with, so obscure and dull, that it comes extremely short of the quickness and\\n', 'variety of Sensations, which is in other Animals: but yet it is sufficient for, and wisely adapted\\n', 'to, the state and condition of that sort of Animals, who are thus made: So that the Wisdom and\\n', 'Goodness of the Maker plainly appears in all the Parts of this stupendious Fabrick, and all the\\n', 'several degrees and ranks of Creatures in it.\\n', '\\n', '(II.ix.12)\\n', 'Moreover, sensation is not the only kind of mental activity Locke assigns to other\\n', 'animals. He thinks they may also “compare” ideas, at least ideas having to do with\\n', '“sensible circumstances annexed to the Objects themselves” (II.xi.5), and although he\\n', 'doubts they are able to “compound” simple ideas into complex ones, animals are able\\n', 'to “take in, and retain together several Combinations of simple Ideas, as possibly the\\n', 'Shape, Smell, and Voice of his Master . . . [as] so many marks whereby he knows him”\\n', '(II.xi.7). Locke has similar doubts that animals are able to “enlarge” ideas. Where\\n', 'Locke draws the line, though, and where he thinks he actually can do more than\\n', 'merely conjecture, is when it comes to abstraction. Non-human animals have no\\n', 'capacity for general ideas, so any mental operations they do have will be about\\n', 'particular ideas: “If it may be doubted, Whether Beasts compound and enlarge their\\n', 'Ideas that way, to any degree: This, I think, I may be positive in, That the power of\\n', 'Abstracting is not at all in them; and that the having of general Ideas, is that which\\n', 'puts the perfect distinction betwixt Men and Brutes” (II.xi.10).\\n', '\\n', 'Importantly, when it comes to the mental activities of animals and the degree to\\n', 'which they mimic human beings, Locke is willing to assign more to animals than one\\n', 'might think. “For if they have any Ideas at all, and are not bare Machins (as some\\n', 'would have them) we cannot deny them to have some Reason” (II.xi.11). Exactly\\n', 'what Locke means by “reason” here is not exactly clear. Given the passages above,\\n', 'perhaps Locke, like Leibniz (1996: 50), thinks that animals are “sheer empirics,” able\\n', 'to draw inductive conclusions on the basis of the regularity of their collections of\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'simple ideas. At the very least we can see Locke’s attribution of some form of\\n', 'reasoning to animals as consistent with his critique of essentialism generally as well\\n', 'as with his critique of Descartes’s explanation of psychological activity as dependent\\n', 'on an immortal soul or substance. And if non-human animals have simple ideas of\\n', 'sensation and they are able to manipulate those ideas in various ways that add variety\\n', 'and richness to their mental lives, I suspect it is not a great leap to say that they are\\n', 'also (to varying degrees) conscious and so self-conscious. Remember that as I have\\n', 'described it, consciousness is pre-reflective. So being self-conscious on this view does\\n', 'not imply that non-human animals can have full-fledged ideas of themselves or a\\n', 'conceptual understanding of themselves. That would require reflection or abstrac-\\n', 'tion. Abstraction, Locke denies to animals. He does not say specifically that non-\\n', 'human animals do not reflect, but if reflection is not present in young children, it is\\n', 'reasonable to think it is not present in other animals. Moreover, I do not believe it is\\n', 'far-fetched to think that many animals have some sense of their thinking as their\\n', 'own—that they pre-reflectively assign whatever ideas they have to themselves.43\\n', 'Given Locke’s reluctance to rule out other kinds of more sophisticated mental activity\\n', 'in animals, it is in keeping that he would not rule out consciousness.\\n', '\\n', '2.5 Consciousness in Memory, Sensitive Knowledge,\\n', 'Personal Identity, and the Cogito\\n', 'There is, as we have seen, quite a bit of evidence that Locke must have been thinking\\n', 'of consciousness in the way I have been arguing. In addition, if we read Locke as\\n', 'seeing consciousness as a reflexive and self-referential perception internal to ordinary\\n', 'perception, namely the awareness of ourselves as perceiving ideas, we can make sense\\n', 'of the independent role given to consciousness in those accounts in which Locke\\n', 'seems to employ consciousness.44 Although I will have much more to say about all\\n', 'the ways in which consciousness is employed in the Essay, for now consider just\\n', 'Locke’s analysis of memory.\\n', '\\n', '43 I know that I am probably guilty of attributing more mental states to my cat than he actually has.

I will have more to say about animal consciousness and its implications for moral agency in chapter five.\\n', '\\n', '44 Arguments how consciousness is important to Locke’s accounts of memory, intuitive knowledge of\\n', 'our own ideas, sensitive knowledge, personal identity, and the cogito are covered in chapters three and four.\\n', '\\n', 'Arguments concerning the importance of consciousness and its role in providing a temporal experience of ourselves is discussed in chapter five. For the argument here in chapter two, it is sufficient to show only that Locke thinks consciousness is important to these other aspects of his philosophy and that there is an interpretation consistent with what we will see are those accounts.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', '“Memory,” Locke says, “signifies, no more but this, that the Mind has a Power, in\\n', 'many cases, to revive Perceptions, which it once had, with this additional Perception\\n', 'annexed to them, that it has had them before” (II.x.2). As already noted, that this\\n', 'additional “annexed” perception is due to consciousness is supported by Locke’s I.iv.20\\n', 'assertion that “to remember is to perceive any thing with memory, or with a conscious-\\n', 'ness, that it was known or perceived before.” This strongly suggests that Locke intends\\n', 'consciousness to contribute something to the perception of an idea that has been\\n', 'revived from memory. Perhaps it contributes the awareness that I have perceived the\\n', 'idea before, which makes the difference in my experience between reviving an idea and\\n', 'other ways of perceiving an idea, say, my experience in sensing (perceiving an idea of\\n', 'sensation). In perceiving an idea I have had before, I am conscious that I am reviving an\\n', 'idea, namely experiencing it as remembered or as from memory.45\\n', 'As Locke continues in I.iv.20, without consciousness that the idea was in my mind\\n', 'before “whatever Idea comes into the mind is new, and not remembered: This\\n', 'consciousness of its having been in the mind before, being that, which distinguishes\\n', 'Remembring from all other ways of Thinking.” If consciousness is identical to\\n', 'ordinary perception, then either this difference cannot be explained or we must\\n', 'attribute to consciousness an idea as an object. Indeed, we would have to say that\\n', 'consciousness is a perception of the idea “had the idea before.” But this\\n', 'interpretation—that consciousness can have an idea as an object—results in the\\n', 'problem that Locke’s account of memory violates the empiricist principle. Moreover,\\n', 'as mentioned at the outset, the I.iv.20 discussion of memory is in the service of an\\n', 'argument against innate ideas, namely against the view that we have ideas that do not\\n', 'originate in sensation and reflection. So, Locke cannot be thinking that the feature that\\n', 'allows for an awareness that makes a memory a memory rather than an idea of\\n', 'sensation is a kind of perception that has an idea as an object, since there is no\\n', 'explanation where that idea originates consistent with Locke’s empiricism. On the\\n', 'view that consciousness is a special kind of awareness internal to ordinary perception\\n', 'we have an account that avoids these problems altogether.

We cannot but believe that\\n', 'our perceptions of sensation have their sources in actually existing objects because, as\\n', 'Locke explains,\\n', '45 As already noted, in II.i.10 Locke seems to equate consciousness with sensibility, and as argued in chapter one, in Locke’s time consciousness was thought to involve a “sentiment interiour.” Indeed, Locke countenanced Coste’s French translation of consciousness as ‘sentiment,’ ‘sentir,’ and even ‘sentir intérieurement.’ This last example is employed to capture what Locke meant in I.iv.20, when he says “Whenever memory brings any idea into actual view, it is with a consciousness [sentir intérieurement] that it had been there before.” In each case, though, Coste is emphasizing the interior nature of the experience of our own thinking.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'we are provided with an Evidence, that puts us past doubting: For I ask anyone, Whether he be\\n', 'not invincibly conscious to himself of a different Perception, when he looks on the Sun by day,\\n', 'and thinks on it by night; when he actually tastes Wormwood, or smells a Rose, or only thinks\\n', 'on that Savour, or Odour?

Moreover, we have seen that Locke’s understanding of\\n', 'consciousness is not only interesting for its value internal to Locke’s philosophy, but\\n', '\\n', '47 I offer promissory notes to make fully explicit in chapters four and five how we achieve unity of consciousness as well as how (and to what extent) we have knowledge of ourselves as temporally extended.\\n', '48 How exactly an awareness of ourselves as thinking results in knowing our own existence is somewhat more complex.

In the next\\n', 'chapter, we move to Locke’s account of knowledge to see how the role of conscious-\\n', 'ness as internal to the perception of an idea helps show how we can have knowledge\\n', 'of own ideas and of ourselves consistent with Locke’s propositional account of\\n', 'knowledge. We will also see how Locke has consciousness playing a crucial role in\\n', 'his account of sensitive knowledge (of the existence of external objects). In parts I, II,\\n', 'and III, we will see how the complexity of our perceptual states results in the\\n', 'agreements perceived in each case. And once we do, what appear to be puzzling\\n', 'inconsistencies in those accounts are reconciled.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '3 Consciousness in Locke’s Theory of Knowledge\\n', '\\n', 'In this chapter, I argue that consciousness plays an essential role in Locke’s theory of\\n', 'knowledge, more specifically in how we know particular things (ideas, our own existence,\\n', 'and the existence of external objects). What brings these various forms of knowledge\\n', 'together is that they all seem to be cases in which Locke describes the knowledge we have\\n', 'as resulting from the perception of a single idea. But such a description appears\\n', 'problematic, for Locke’s definition of knowledge generally seems to require the percep-\\n', 'tion of more than one idea. Fortunately, however, the difficulty is resolved once we\\n', 'appreciate the role consciousness, as a constituent of a more complex perceptual state,\\n', 'plays in each instance of knowledge. To show better how my interpretation of con-\\n', 'sciousness permits a unified account of each of these cases of knowing a particular thing,\\n', 'I have structured the chapter somewhat unusually. After a brief introduction to Locke’s\\n', 'theory of knowledge, the chapter is divided into three parts. Each part provides an\\n', 'account of how consciousness as a constituent of a more complex mental state helps to\\n', 'constitute the agreement known in the three instances of knowing a particular thing.\\n', '\\n', 'What emerges for the first time is a structurally integrated account of how we know our\\n', 'own ideas, our own existence, and the existence of things external to us.\\n', '\\n', 'Locke begins the Essay with a mission statement: “This, therefore, being my\\n', 'Purpose to enquire into the Original, Certainty, and Extent of Humane Knowledge;\\n', 'together, with the Grounds and Degrees of Belief, Opinion, and Assent” (I.i.2).\\n', '\\n', 'Utilizing what he calls the “Historical, plain Method,” Locke sets out to uncover\\n', 'the limits of human knowledge as well as the grounds for belief (for Locke, probable\\n', 'judgment) in cases where we do not achieve knowledge. Such an “historical” method\\n', 'seeks to give a genetic account of knowledge, laying out its origins in a sort of natural\\n', 'history telling the story of how from simple psychological elements the mind comes\\n', 'to have more and more sophisticated mental content, including knowledge. Employ-\\n', 'ing such a method emphasizes a search for the limits of our knowledge based on an\\n', 'introspective investigation of our own minds. By revealing the nature of thinking and\\n', 'the facts of our own psychological experience we can come to realize the extent to\\n', 'which we can rightfully claim to know anything:\\n', '[T]he Understanding . . . is certainly a Subject, even for its Nobleness, worth our Labour to\\n', 'enquire into . . . And it requires Art and Pains to set it at a distance, and make it its own Object.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'But whatever be the Difficulties, that lie in the way of this Enquiry; whatever it be, that keeps us so much in the Dark to our selves; sure I am, that all the Light we can let in upon our Minds; all\\n', 'the Acquaintance we can make with our own Understandings, will not only be very pleasant;\\n', 'but bring us great Advantage, in directing our Thoughts in the search of other Things.\\n', '\\n', '(I.i.1)\\n', 'Locke has every expectation that by making the understanding the object of inquiry,\\n', 'namely by turning our attention to an introspective investigation of the human mind,\\n', 'we can locate the boundaries of knowledge, such that no longer will we think we have\\n', 'knowledge when we have insufficient justification for it. In spite of Locke’s confidence in\\n', 'the project, there is a good deal of scholarly controversy over exactly where he actually\\n', 'draws the line between knowledge and opinion. We see this especially in relation to\\n', 'Locke’s account of “sensitive” knowledge (of external world objects), which is the focus\\n', 'of parts II and III of this chapter. But first, in this introduction to the chapter, I want to\\n', 'give a brief account of those aspects of Locke’s theories of knowledge and belief insofar\\n', 'as they, and the role consciousness plays in them, are the subject of the entire chapter.\\n', '\\n', 'Following his “Historical, plain Method,” Locke first considers the origin of ideas,\\n', '“which a Man observes, and is conscious to himself that he has in his Mind; and the ways\\n', 'whereby the Understanding comes to be furnished with them” (I.i.3). A thorough\\n', 'investigation of the experience of our own thinking reveals no justification for the claim\\n', 'that we have innate ideas. Whether or not Locke has considered all the ways in which\\n', 'ideas can be innate is a good question.1 In spite of the scholarship’s answer to this query,\\n', 'however, certainly Locke thinks he has sufficiently argued the case, and so draws the\\n', 'conclusion that all ideas must have their origin in experience: in sensation and reflection.\\n', '\\n', 'Locke then proceeds to give a compositional account of how we come by all of our ideas\\n', 'via a host of perceptual acts, which he also calls “mental operations.”2 Locke sees the mind\\n', 'as composed of two faculties or powers: the understanding and the will. The understand-\\n', 'ing is the power of perception, and the will is the power of volition. Therefore, acts of the\\n', 'understanding (sensing, reflecting, discerning, comparing, knowing, believing, etc.) are all\\n', 'perceptions.3 Moreover, as already argued, all perceptions include self-consciousness, and\\n', 'as will become clear in a moment, all perceptions include ideas.\\n', '\\n', 'It is a controversial question what is Locke’s notion of an idea, and he was not\\n', 'particularly careful in his talk about ideas.4 Sometimes he seems to conflate ideas\\n', '1 See Atherton (1998), Rickless (2007), and De Rosa (forthcoming) for analyses of Locke’s opponents and success in his arguments against innate ideas.\\n', '\\n', '2 See Bolton (2007) for an enlightening discussion of both the structural and compositional features of both simple and complex ideas.\\n', '\\n', '3 “The two great and principle Actions of the Mind, which are most frequently considered, and which are so frequent, that every one that pleases, may take notice of ’em in himself, are these two: Perception, or Thinking, and Volition, or Willing. The Power of Thinking is called the Understanding, and the Power of Volition is called the Will, and these two Powers or Abilities in the Mind are denominated Faculties. Of some of the Modes of these simple Ideas of Reflection, such as are Remembrance, Discerning, Reasoning, Judging, Knowledge, Faith, etc. I shall have occasion to speak hereafter” (II.vi.2). Ideas of reflection are ideas of mental operations, which confirms that Locke thinks all acts of the understanding (mental operations) are perceptions.\\n', '\\n', '4 Chappell (1994) has a good survey of the various views on the nature of Lockean ideas. See also Bolton (2007).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'with acts of perception as we find in this passage: “To ask, at what time a Man has\\n', 'first any Ideas, is to ask, when he begins to perceive; having Ideas, and Perception\\n', 'being the same thing” (II.i.9).5 John Yolton (1984: 90) takes the conflation to be\\n', 'Locke’s considered view. I take passages like this to be less careful ways of saying that\\n', 'although we can conceptually distinguish acts of perception from ideas, in experi-\\n', 'ence we never have ideas without acts of perception or acts of perception without\\n', 'ideas.6 Putting this issue aside, it is not at all clear that Locke himself was concerned\\n', 'to figure out the nature of ideas. When questioned about it by Stillingfleet, he\\n', 'responds,\\n', 'So that supposing ideas real spiritual things ever so much, if they are neither substances nor\\n', 'modes, let them be what they will, I am no more instructed in their nature, than when I am told\\n', 'they are perceptions, such as I find them. (Works, ix.220)\\n', 'In spite of Locke’s lack of concern, it is probably helpful to clarify the way in which\\n', 'I interpret Lockean ideas. Locke seems to state pretty clearly that ideas are some sort\\n', 'of mental objects. Textual support for this conclusion includes I.i.8, where Locke says\\n', 'about ‘idea,’ “It being that Term, which, I think, serves best to stand for whatsoever is\\n', 'the Object of the Understanding when a Man thinks”; II.viii.8, where we find,\\n', '“Whatsoever the Mind perceives in it self, or is the immediate object of Perception,\\n', 'Thought, or Understanding”; and IV.xxi.4, where we have, “For since the Things, the\\n', 'Mind contemplates, are none of them, besides it self, present to the Understanding,\\n', '’tis necessary that something else, as a Sign or Representation of the thing it\\n', 'considers, should be present to it.” Passages like these lead us to think that ideas\\n', 'are mental objects that mediate between us and an external world.\\n', '\\n', 'Indeed, Locke can be seen to have what is called a “representational theory of\\n', 'perception,” according to which the immediate objects of our acts of perception are\\n', 'ideas.7 And, as I have argued, perceptions of ideas also include consciousness.\\n', '\\n', 'Because consciousness is an intrinsic feature of all acts of perception, we are\\n', 'conscious of all of our ideas—that we are perceiving them. Therefore, I take Locke\\n', 'to think that perceptions of ideas are complex mental states having constituent\\n', 'elements. At the very least the complexity consists in an act of perception, an idea\\n', 'perceived, and consciousness that I am perceiving the idea.\\n', '\\n', 'The fourth and final book of the Essay extends the account of the origin and\\n', 'generation of ideas to an explanation of how perceptions of ideas can lead to\\n', 'knowledge and certainty. Knowledge, Locke defines as “the perception of the\\n', '5 Other examples include I.iv.21, II.i.5, and II.i.23,\\n', '6 See also, for example, Chappell (1994).\\n', '\\n', '7 Attributing this view to Locke is consistent with the bulk of Locke scholarship. See Newman (2004: 273–6) for a good discussion of the various specific commitments different representationalist interpretations attribute to Locke. See also, for example, Reid (1785/1969), Mackie (1976), Ayers (1991), Chappell (1994), Jolley (1999), Bolton (2004a, 2004b), Rickless (2008), Allen (2013), and Nagel (forthcoming). Those interpreting Locke as having a direct theory of perception include Yolton (1984) and Lennon (2004).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'connexion and agreement, or disagreement and repugnancy of any of our Ideas . . .\\n', '\\n', 'Where this Perception is, there is Knowledge, and where it is not, there, though we\\n', 'may fancy, guess, or believe, yet we always come short of Knowledge” (IV.i.2).8 As the\\n', 'result of having ideas in the mind, we are able to perceive (know) how they agree or\\n', 'disagree. Locke can be seen to confirm his definition of knowledge in his claims that\\n', 'all knowledge is propositional. In II.xxxiii.19, for example, we find, “our Knowledge,\\n', 'which all consists in Propositions,” and again in the Correspondence with Stillingfleet\\n', '(Locke, 1823, iv: 357), Locke says, “Everything which we either know or believe, is\\n', 'some proposition.” In addition, in the IV.v.1 definition of truth, Locke is clear that\\n', 'the “joining or separating of Signs” whose agreement or disagreement constitutes\\n', 'truth “is what by another name, we call Proposition.”9\\n', 'Agreements (or disagreements) of ideas, the perception of which constitutes\\n', 'knowledge, are arranged into four categories: “1. Identity, or Diversity. 2. Relation,\\n', '3. Co-existence, or necessary connexion, [and] 4. Real Existence” (IV.i.3). “Identity,”\\n', 'Locke seems to limit to knowing our own ideas as they are in the mind. It is to\\n', 'perceive that each idea agrees with itself, although what Locke seems really to mean is\\n', 'that we know of each idea “what it is” (IV.i.4) or that “it is as [we] perceive it to be”\\n', '(IV.ii.1). Knowing that two ideas are “diverse” is to know that “one is not the other”\\n', '(IV.i.4). “Relation” is a very broad category of agreements comprising everything that\\n', 'does not fall into one of the other three categories. Locke usually turns to mathem-\\n', 'atical relations as examples, but we can include knowing any sort of relation between\\n', 'our ideas.10 Knowing an agreement of “necessary co-existence” in the same subject is\\n', 'a type of knowledge particularly about substances—that some quality of a substance\\n', 'as represented by an idea is necessarily joined by some other quality as represented by\\n', 'a different idea (IV.i.6). Finally, we know only three “real existences”: the existence of\\n', 'ourselves, of God, and of particular external objects (IV.i.7).\\n', '\\n', 'Although when push comes to shove Locke thinks that all four categories of\\n', 'agreements are relations, he tells us that some agreements are so “peculiar . . . that\\n', 'they deserve well to be considered under distinct heads, and not under Relation in\\n', 'general, since they are such different grounds of affirmation and negation” (IV.i.7).\\n', '\\n', 'That is, Locke could have said that to know an agreement of ideas is simply to know a\\n', 'relation of ideas and left it at that. But then what I take to be a meaningful\\n', '“peculiarity . . . of the different grounds of affirmation and negation” would have\\n', '8 Hereafter, in most cases, for ease, I will shorten the definition of knowledge to “the perception of an agreement of ideas.”\\n', '9 For some of the more recent secondary literature espousing this view, see, for example, Mattern\\n', '(1978), Soles (1985), Newman (2004, 2007), Rickless (2008), and Nagel (forthcoming) for interpretations of Locke’s theory of knowledge and especially of sensitive knowledge that emphasize the propositional nature of knowledge.\\n', '\\n', '10 Locke himself says very little specifically about this category: “The next sort of Agreement, or Disagreement, the Mind perceives in any of its Ideas, may, I think, be called Relative, and is nothing but the Perception of the Relation between any two Ideas, of what kind soever, whether Substances, Modes, or any other” (IV.i.5).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'been glossed over. Locke mentions only identity and co-existence as having this\\n', 'peculiarity. As with the agreement of identity, I also take the agreement of real\\n', 'existence with respect to knowing our own existence and knowing the existence of\\n', 'external objects to be somewhat peculiar. One, but not the only, reason to think that\\n', 'knowing particular real existences is like knowing a particular idea is that Locke\\n', 'refers to ideas as particular “real existences”: “Every Man’s Reasoning and Know-\\n', 'ledge, is only about the Ideas existing in his own Mind, which are truly, every one of\\n', 'them, particular Existences: and our Knowledge and reasoning about other Things, is\\n', 'only as they correspond with those our particular Ideas” (IV.xvii.8).\\n', '\\n', 'The peculiarity consists, as Locke says, in the “grounds of affirmation and neg-\\n', 'ation,” that is, in the way in which the agreement is constituted and perceived. Having\\n', 'any knowledge, whether peculiar or not, for Locke, is the result of perceiving agreeing\\n', 'ideas. This means that ideas are in the mind simultaneously. Examples of having\\n', 'simultaneous ideas in the mind include, but are not limited to, cases of the compos-\\n', 'ition of simple ideas to create complex ones, cases of reflection, and cases of compar-\\n', 'ing or juxtaposing ideas. In the mental operation of “COMPOSITION” the mind “puts\\n', 'together several of those simple ones [ideas] it has received from Sensation and\\n', 'Reflection, and combines them into complex ones” (II.xi.6). “Reflection,” Locke\\n', 'explains, “is the Perception of the Operations of our own Minds within us, as it is\\n', 'employed about the Ideas it has got” (II.i.4), which implies that the reflective percep-\\n', 'tion is in the mind at the same time as the perception that is its object. Additionally, in\\n', 'comparing ideas “the Mind so considers one thing, that it does, as it were, bring it to,\\n', 'and set it by another, and carry its view from one t’other” (II.xxv.1). In all three cases,\\n', 'ideas are perceived in the mind simultaneously, that is, there is a complex perceptual\\n', 'state.11 And when there are ideas in the mind simultaneously and there are agree-\\n', 'ments between those ideas, we can know those agreements.12 We might say that those\\n', 'agreements are presented to us in consciousness. That is, insofar we know an\\n', 'agreement of ideas, we are conscious of ourselves as knowing it.\\n', '\\n', 'My interpretation of Locke’s theory of knowledge includes two claims: one is\\n', 'novel; the other is not. First, the non-novel claim: knowing an agreement intuitively\\n', '(or non-inferentially) need not require a mental act in addition to the complex\\n', 'perceptual state wherein we find the agreeing ideas. That is, we can have\\n', 'non-inferential knowledge (perceive an agreement) just in virtue of attending to\\n', 'whatever constitutes the agreement. There is no need for an additional mental act.13\\n', '11 This is not also to say that Locke has a sufficient answer (or any answer at all) to the question of how ideas are psychologically bound together in the mind. Here, to my knowledge, he is in the same boat as all the early moderns.\\n', '\\n', '12 But this does not mean that we will always perceive an agreement when there is one, for more ideas may be required to show the agreement or make it evident to us. That would be the difference between intuitive and demonstrative knowledge (IV.ii.1–2).\\n', '\\n', '13 Ayers (1991, I: 107ff, 1997: 157–88) and Owen (1999: ch. 3, 2007: 410ff) interpret Locke as having what might be called a “one-act” theory of knowledge, which has some difficult consequences for Locke.\\n', '\\n', 'Ott (2004: 45–8), Newman (2007: 321), and van der Schaar (2008: 340) argue against this interpretation,\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'As I have argued, perceptions of ideas are complex mental states that include, at the\\n', 'very least, a perceptual act, an idea perceived, and the consciousness of myself as\\n', 'perceiving. And when there are simultaneous perceptions of ideas, there is an even\\n', 'more complex mental state in which we are conscious that we are perceiving multiple\\n', 'ideas. Furthermore, if there are ideas in my mind simultaneously, then, without any\\n', 'additional act of the mind, we can know intuitively (be conscious of) any agreements\\n', 'therein.14 I will have more to say about this in part I of this chapter. In addition, that\\n', 'we have simultaneous ideas and we are conscious we are perceiving each idea results\\n', 'in unity of consciousness in perceiving more than one idea. I will have more to\\n', 'say about the unity of consciousness and the work it does for Locke in chapters\\n', 'four and five.\\n', '\\n', 'Now for the novel claim: I will argue that there are other aspects of mental\\n', 'content that can play a role in constituting an agreement of ideas. My proposal is\\n', 'that we can see the peculiarity in cases of knowing an idea, knowing our own\\n', 'existence, and knowing the existence of an external object as due to two factors.\\n', '\\n', 'First, part of the peculiarity is due to the fact that in these cases my knowledge is of\\n', 'a particular individual thing. That is, I know a particular truth as opposed to a\\n', 'general one. Although I think these instances of knowledge are consistent with the\\n', 'general definition of knowledge, it is not so easy to see how. Second, and relatedly,\\n', 'part of the peculiarity in knowing the agreements constituting our knowledge of the\\n', 'identity of an idea, of our own existence, and of the existence of external objects is\\n', 'due to the complexity of our perceptual states. For example, knowing an idea and\\n', 'knowing that we exist depend on the first-personal character of consciousness as a\\n', 'constituent element in a more complex mental state resulting from the perception\\n', 'of an idea. Because this first-personal character is itself an element of the complex\\n', 'mental state, it can play a role in constituting an agreement. We will also see that\\n', 'Locke has consciousness playing a role in the agreement in an instance of knowing\\n', 'the existence of something external to me, but it is different from what we find in\\n', 'the other two cases. But here, too, it is because of the complexity of our perceptual\\n', 'states that we are able to perceive the agreement constituting what Locke calls\\n', '“sensitive knowledge” of the existence of particular finite beings. In none of the\\n', 'cases, though, must the account violate Locke’s definition of knowledge as the\\n', 'perception of an agreement of ideas.\\n', '\\n', 'One might wonder why I am not considering the “peculiarity” in knowing agree-\\n', 'ments of “necessary co-existence in the same subject.” First, according to Locke, we\\n', 'have virtually no knowledge of this category except insofar as particular collections of\\n', 'defending a “proto-Fregean” account in order to avoid some of these difficulties. Marušić (2014: 263–78) provides a recent very compelling argument against the “proto-Fregean” view and in defense of the “one-act” view.\\n', '\\n', '14 Nagel (forthcoming) puts it this way: “Even to entertain an agreement of ideas that is intuitively knowable is already to know it intuitively.”\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'simple ideas make up our complex ideas of substances. If this is the extent of our\\n', 'knowledge, then it is not hard to make the case that in perceiving a complex idea, say,\\n', 'of gold, I am conscious of the simple ideas composing it. But knowledge of necessary\\n', 'connection is much more than that. It is knowing that there is a necessary dependence\\n', 'of one idea on another, which requires knowing the metaphysical relation between\\n', 'insensible bodies and the metaphysical dependence of ideas on the powers of those\\n', 'related bodies to produce them. Locke is clear that such knowledge is very scarce:\\n', 'This, how weighty and considerable a part soever of Humane Science, is yet very narrow, and\\n', 'scarce any at all. The reason whereof is that the simple Ideas whereof our complex Ideas of\\n', 'Substances are made up, are, for the most part such, as carry with them, in their own Nature,\\n', 'no visible necessary connexion, or inconsistency with any other simple Ideas, whose\\n', 'co-existence with them we would inform ourselves about.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.iii.10)\\n', 'In vain, therefore, shall we endeavour to discover by our Ideas, (the only true way of certain\\n', 'and universal knowledge,) what other Ideas are to be constantly joined with that of our\\n', 'complex Idea of any Substance: since we neither know the real Constitution of the minute\\n', 'Parts, on which their Qualities do depend; nor, did we know them, could we discover any\\n', 'necessary connexion between them, and any of the secondary Qualities: which is necessary to\\n', 'be done, before we can certainly know their necessary co-existence.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.iii.14)\\n', 'Locke mentions two exceptions, but the necessary connection “reaches very little farther\\n', 'than our Experience. Indeed, some few of the primary Qualities have a necessary\\n', 'dependence, and visible connexion one with another, as Figure necessarily supposes\\n', 'Extension, receiving or communicating Motion by impulse, supposes Solidity”\\n', '(IV.iii.14). Locke does not provide any further description of these instances of intuitively\\n', 'knowing a necessary co-existence. I suspect when he says we know it only by experience\\n', 'he means that when we perceive an idea of figure, we always also perceive an idea of\\n', 'extension. We cannot perceive the one idea without the other; perceiving their co-\\n', 'existence is psychologically unavoidable. Perhaps this is some of the peculiarity of the\\n', 'way of perceiving the agreement. If so, then, as we will see, these two cases of knowing a\\n', 'necessary co-existence, namely the psychological unavoidability of the two ideas simul-\\n', 'taneously together in the mind and thus the perception of their agreement, is fully\\n', 'compatible with my interpretation of how we have the other peculiar forms of knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'What is quite unusual, though, about Locke’s theory of knowledge, I think, is that he\\n', 'allows three degrees of certainty of knowledge: intuitive, demonstrative, and sensitive.\\n', '\\n', 'Intuitive knowledge is an immediate perception of an agreement, where demonstration\\n', 'requires an intervening idea to show the agreement. Demonstrative knowledge results\\n', 'from a chain of reasoning—a proof or a demonstration—in which each step is known\\n', 'intuitively. Moreover, although “where-ever the Mind perceives the Agreement or\\n', 'Disagreement of any Ideas,” says Locke, “there be certain knowledge” (IV.ii.2), not\\n', 'all perceptions of agreements carry the same degree of certainty. Demonstrative\\n', 'knowledge is a little less certain than intuitive knowledge, and sensitive knowledge\\n', '(of the existence of external objects) falls somewhere in between demonstrative\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'knowledge and probability.15 Although Descartes, too, saw demonstrative knowledge\\n', 'as less certain than what we know by intuition, when it comes to the certainty of\\n', 'sensitive knowledge, Locke separates himself from every other seventeenth-century\\n', 'thinker I can of. Attributions of certain knowledge are generally reserved only for\\n', 'intuition and demonstration, what we might call “knowledge proper.” Given the\\n', 'Cartesian skeptical concerns, Locke’s representational theory of perception, and his\\n', 'goal of discovering the limits of human understanding, it is surprising that he would\\n', 'want to include representations of external world objects as providing “sensitive”\\n', 'knowledge. More naturally one would conclude, as some do, that what Locke calls\\n', 'sensitive knowledge is really only a high degree of probability. In part III of this chapter,\\n', 'I will argue that Locke’s inclusion of sensitive knowledge as having a degree of certainty\\n', 'appropriate to his understanding of knowledge is consistent with his reasons for why\\n', 'there is a difference in the certainty of intuitive and demonstrative knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'Let me also add that Locke’s account of probability, although having parallel features,\\n', 'is significantly different from his account of knowledge. For Locke, ideas may agree, in\\n', 'which case there is truth, but unless we actually perceive them to agree there is no\\n', 'knowledge. Therefore, in having knowledge it is the perception of the agreement that\\n', 'counts. If we do not perceive the agreement (either because we are unable to for lack of\\n', 'intervening ideas or there is not one), then the best we can do is some degree of assent to\\n', 'a probable judgment. “Judgment,” says Locke, “. . . is the putting Ideas together, or\\n', 'separating them from one another in the Mind, when their certain Agreement or\\n', 'Disagreement is not perceived, but presumed to be so” (IV.xiv.4). Probable judgment\\n', 'is taking there to be an agreement (or disagreement) when we do not actually perceive\\n', 'one. Moreover, there is no direct analogue between the degrees of certainty of know-\\n', 'ledge and the degrees of assent to a probable judgment, for all cases of probability are\\n', 'cases of proofs. We do not immediately “presume” ideas to agree; there is always an\\n', 'intervening idea doing some work to bolster the presumption. “That which makes me\\n', 'believe,” Locke says, “is something extraneous to the thing I believe; something not\\n', 'evidently joined on both sides to, and so not manifestly shewing the Agreement or\\n', 'Disagreement of those Ideas, that are under consideration” (IV.xv.3).16 In other words,\\n', 'probable judgments are always inferential, which I am interpreting as the result of a\\n', 'mediating idea (or proposition). Only two kinds of grounds or justification are used in\\n', 'probabilistic reasoning: “First, The conformity of any thing with our own Knowledge,\\n', 'Observation, and Experience. Secondly, The testimony of others, vouching their\\n', '15 This is not an uncontroversial claim. In defense of his claim that sensitive knowledge, for Locke, is not really knowledge but a very high degree of probability, Rickless (forthcoming) argues that demonstrative knowledge is not less certain than intuitive knowledge.\\n', '\\n', '16 See also IV.xv.1: “As Demonstration is the shewing the Agreement, or Disagreement of two Ideas, by the intervention of one or more Proofs, which have a constant, immutable, and visible connexion one with another: so Probability is nothing but the appearance of such an Agreement, or Disagreement, by the intervention of Proofs, whose connexion is not constant and immutable, or at least is not perceived to be so, but is, or appears for the most part to be so, and enough to induce the Mind to judge the Proposition to be true, or false, rather then the contrary.”\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'Observation and Experience” (IV.xv.4). The intervening idea justifying the presump-\\n', 'tion of an agreement is our own past experience or testimony of the experience of\\n', 'others. Factors attesting to the reliability of the testimony of another, things like the\\n', 'integrity of the testifier, the skill of the witness, whether there is any contrary experience,\\n', 'etc., justify the degree to which we assent to the belief. And degrees of belief range from\\n', 'assurance and confidence to conjecture, wavering, doubt, distrust, and disbelief\\n', '(IV.xvi.6–9).\\n', '\\n', 'Importantly also, for Locke, there is an involuntary aspect to both belief and\\n', 'knowledge—something over which we have no control. When we perceive an\\n', 'agreement, we do not choose to be certain, nor do we voluntarily assign ourselves\\n', 'a degree of assent given the evidence for a probable judgment. We just see the\\n', 'agreement (the truth) and experience certainty; in probable judgment we just\\n', 'naturally presume the proposition to be true to a degree warranted by how we are\\n', 'affected by the evidence.17 This is not to say that we have no epistemic responsibility\\n', 'when it comes to what we believe. We do, and in fact Locke’s project to discover the\\n', 'limits of knowledge would in some ways be in vain were we to have no control at all\\n', 'over what we believe. Our responsibility is to seek knowledge (the perception of\\n', 'agreeing or disagreeing ideas), and when we fail to achieve it, to recognize that much\\n', 'of what we claim to know really only reaches various levels of probability depending\\n', 'on the reliability of the evidence.18\\n', 'Why then would he think we have knowledge of the external world, especially since\\n', 'drawing the proper boundary between knowledge and probability is Locke’s stated\\n', 'task in the Essay? And what does all of this have to do with consciousness? I suggest\\n', 'that Locke’s “Historical, plain Method” of providing an account of the facts of\\n', 'experience leads him to his controversial conclusions concerning the status of sensi-\\n', 'tive knowledge. I argue that insofar as it reveals to us the experience of our own\\n', 'thinking, Locke’s introspective method is key to understanding how we have know-\\n', 'ledge of our own ideas and ourselves (the topics of part I) and of external objects (the\\n', 'topic of parts II and III). Understanding the important role of our experience in\\n', 'perceiving ideas, as it pertains to Locke’s claims concerning how we have these various\\n', 'forms of knowledge, is the task of the entire chapter. Consciousness, as providing\\n', 'some of that experience, as we will see, plays a significant role in each case.

There are\\n', 'four categories of agreement: first, there is “Identity, or Diversity,” which is the\\n', 'agreement of an idea with itself, or its disagreement with any other idea (IV.i.4);\\n', 'second, there is “Co-existence . . . in the same Subject,” which is the agreement ideas\\n', 'of qualities have that are necessarily found together in complex ideas of substances\\n', '(IV.1.6); third, there is “Real Existence,” which is knowledge of the existence of\\n', 'ourselves, God, and particular finite things (external objects) (IV.iii.21); and finally,\\n', 'there is “relation in general,” which is a catch-all category for those agreements that\\n', 'do not fall under the specific definitions of the other three (IV.i.5, IV.i.7). For\\n', 'example, mathematical relations fall into this last group, as do agreements of\\n', 'resemblance or size.

Therefore, what we know in\\n', 'each case must be consistent with Locke’s definition of knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'When Locke describes the category of “Identity, or Diversity,” he speaks only of the\\n', 'intuitive knowledge we have of our own individual ideas.

In addition,\\n', 'he distinguishes this sort of knowledge from general maxims or propositions that\\n', 'express an identity relation. For example, he says:\\n', 'A Man infallibly knows, as soon as ever he has them in his Mind that the Ideas he calls White\\n', 'and Round, are the very Ideas they are, and that they are not other Ideas, which he calls Red or\\n', 'Square. Nor can any Maxim or Proposition in the World make him know it clearer or surer\\n', 'than he did before, and without any such general Rule.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.i.4)\\n', 'But if knowing a particular idea is not by virtue of perceiving a general maxim\\n', 'or analytic proposition, then how is it consistent with the general definition of\\n', 'knowledge?

In addition, we will see that\\n', 'the same account leads to an explanation of how we know our own existence, namely\\n', 'Locke’s version of the cogito argument.

In part II, I offer my own solution to this problem.\\n', '\\n', '20 Gibson (1960), Aaron (1971), Mabbott (1973), and Ayers (1991) mention knowledge of the agree-\\n', 'ment of identity, but dismiss it as “trifling.” Yolton (1985) and Jolley (1999) do not mention it at all. One exception is Lex Newman (2007: 328n18). I will have more to say about Newman’s suggestion shortly.\\n', '\\n', '21 There is a significant amount of literature on “immunity to error through misidentification” (IEM), which began with Wittgenstein’s (1958) distinction in The Blue Book, between degrees of first-person privilege depending on whether in any self-ascription the pronoun ‘I’ or ‘my’ is used as subject or object.\\n', '\\n', 'The issue was taken up in a paper by Shoemaker (1968), which spawned the contemporary discussion.\\n', '\\n', 'More generally, epistemic states that are IEM are a subset of infallible states. They are both propositional and true. I am using the term (IEM) only in a very general way to showcase both the propositional nature and the kind of epistemic infallibility Locke assigns to knowledge of our own ideas. For Locke, when I know an idea, I am immune to error relative to my own first-personal identification of the idea. I cannot be wrong when I claim to know that the idea, as Locke says, “is such as . . . [I] perceive[ . . . ] it to be” (IV.ii.1).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'happen any doubt about it, ’twill always be found to be about the Names, and not the\\n', 'Ideas themselves” (IV.i.4). Although I can be confused owing to attaching a name to a\\n', 'too coarsely grained idea, it cannot be the case that I am unsure about the idea itself—\\n', 'whether what I am perceiving is the idea I think it is.22\\n', 'Right off the bat, one might object that I have conjured up an interpretive problem\\n', 'for Locke that does not exist. For I have conflated the perception of ideas with the\\n', 'perception of agreements of ideas. Consider, for example, II.xxi.5, where Locke\\n', 'distinguishes the three powers of perception constituting the understanding:\\n', 'Perception, which we make the act of the Understanding, is of three sorts: 1. The Perception\\n', 'of Ideas in our Minds, 2. The Perception of the signification of Signs. 3. The Perception of\\n', 'the Connexion or Repugnancy, Agreement or Disagreement, that there is between any of\\n', 'our Ideas.\\n', '\\n', 'Perceiving ideas, the objector continues, is foundational, while knowing the identity\\n', 'of an idea consists in a proposition in which there are two tokens of a single idea type.\\n', '\\n', 'So, there is no problem with how one knows the identity of an idea, and there is no\\n', 'need for perceptions of ideas to be propositional.\\n', '\\n', 'But this objection misses the target. First, in the very next sentence of the above\\n', 'passage, Locke states this: “All these [powers of perception] are attributed to the\\n', 'Understanding, or perceptive Power, though it be the two latter only that use allows\\n', 'us to say we understand” (II.xxi.5). Yet, if Locke thinks we have knowledge of\\n', 'individual ideas, and he includes it in Book IV (Of Knowledge in General), then he\\n', 'must be thinking that when we perceive an idea, we understand something consti-\\n', 'tuting knowledge. So, I do not think that Locke means the power of perceiving ideas\\n', 'to be fully capturing his Book IV discussion of knowing an idea. Second, Locke\\n', 'cannot be thinking that what we understand when we know an idea is an analytic\\n', 'proposition (two tokens of a single idea type), for he devotes an entire chapter to\\n', 'explaining why these sorts of propositions are “trivial” as opposed to “instructive.”\\n', 'I take it that when Locke says we “understand” something, he means it to be\\n', 'something substantive.23 Third, Locke claims that we know the identity of “each”\\n', '22 Locke (1975) also points to the importance of the knowledge of our own ideas at the very beginning of the Essay, in the “Epistle to the Reader.” He makes note of a clarification to the new edition. He thinks this change “was necessary to mention. Because it ran through the whole Book, and is of consequence to be rightly understood” (p. 12). Locke says he prefers to use the terms “determined” and “determinate,” rather than “clear and distinct,” to describe having ideas in the mind: “By those denominations, I mean some object in the Mind, and consequently determined, i.e. such as it is there seen and perceived to be” (p. 13).\\n', '\\n', 'Locke explains that ideas are determined prior to being denominated, which is consistent with the passage above in which Locke describes confusion as not having to do with anything inherent in the perception (or knowledge) of an idea, but with the failure of terms (denominations) to distinguish a particular idea sufficiently from another similar to it.\\n', '\\n', '23 Bolton (1992: 415) argues that, for Locke, we know our ideas (we are not ignorant of them) in the following three ways: “(1) A person who perceives an idea . . . [is not] ignorant of what distinguishes it from one or more other ideas. (2) A person . . . [is not] mistaken about the features [the idea] is perceived to have.\\n', '\\n', 'Or, (3) a person . . . [is not] uncertain or mistaken as to what the idea represents (i.e. the rule for its\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'idea individually “at first view.” It is the “first Act of the Mind, when it has any . . .\\n', '\\n', 'Ideas . . . to know each what it is” (IV.i.4). But if we know the identity of an individual\\n', 'idea upon the very first perception of it (“at first view”), and the agreement consists in\\n', 'a proposition in which there are two tokens of an idea type, then there is a problem of\\n', 'accounting for the second idea token agreeing to the original idea perceived.24\\n', 'Therefore, knowing an idea seems not to be the result of perceiving two tokens of\\n', 'an idea type, and there is some need for an account of Locke’s claim that we have\\n', 'intuitive knowledge of individual ideas.\\n', '\\n', 'We should also be clear, as was mentioned earlier, that knowing the identity of an\\n', 'idea is not the result of already knowing a general principle of identity. Locke asserts,\\n', 'the Mind clearly and infallibly perceives each Idea to agree with it self, and to be what it is; . . . at first view, by its natural power of Perception and Distinction. And though Men of Art have\\n', 'reduced this into those general Rules, What is, is; and it is impossible for the same thing to be,\\n', 'and not to be, for ready application in all cases, wherein there may be occasion to reflect on it;\\n', 'yet it is certain that the first exercise of this Faculty is about particular Ideas. (IV.i.4)\\n', 'Consider again that Locke is drawing a distinction between knowing our own ideas\\n', 'individually by the “first exercise of this Faculty [‘of Perception and Distinction’]”\\n', 'and an act of reason (as Locke uses the term) or reflection by which we would\\n', 'recognize that the individual identity fits under a general principle concerning all\\n', 'ideas. Not only does Locke think that we have intuitive knowledge of particular ideas,\\n', 'but the view I am advocating does not see Locke as requiring reason, reflection, or\\n', 'any other perceptual act for intuitive knowledge at all. Rather, non-inferential forms\\n', 'of knowledge can be conveyed as part of first-order perceptual acts. From this we can\\n', 'conclude, first, that I know that any idea in my mind is the idea it is, and, second, that\\n', 'the reason why I know the identity is in virtue of that particular perceptual state itself\\n', 'and not because of anything else. We can then move on to answer these next two\\n', 'questions concerning our knowledge of our own ideas: How can we know these\\n', 'agreements as the result of perceiving an idea, and what is the nature of the\\n', 'proposition known? From what I have been arguing, crucial to the story is that\\n', 'perceptions of ideas are complex mental states with constituent elements.\\n', '\\n', 'extension).” Bolton then concentrates on establishing (3) in terms of Locke’s theory of how ideas represent things external to us. As will be clear soon, I will distinguish the knowledge in (3) from what we have in (1) and (2) and then focus on the latter. I am also arguing that consistent with Locke’s other commitments, our knowledge of our own ideas (what we have in (1) and (2)) is propositional, although I do not think Bolton would deny this. See also Ayers (1991: 98), who acknowledges that “on Locke’s view the perception of the identity or diversity of ideas reduces to the ‘discerning’ or distinguishing of a single idea or two different ideas.” He continues, “Since we cannot have ideas without distinguishing them, the potentiality for a kind of propositional knowledge is bound up with the very having of ideas.” In a comparison of Locke with Descartes, Loeb (1981: 54) claims that for both “we have intuitive knowledge of propositions about the content of our present sensory states.” I take Loeb to be saying that knowing our own ideas, for Locke, is a form of substantive propositional knowledge.\\n', '\\n', '24 In section 3.I.4, I consider and reject ways in which an analytic proposition consisting in two tokens of a type can be constructed “at first sight” given the perception of an individual idea.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The task, then, is to provide an account of how we have propositional knowledge\\n', 'of individual ideas consistent with Locke’s theory of knowledge generally, and in so\\n', 'doing also reveal the important role consciousness plays. As mentioned earlier, there\\n', 'has been almost no treatment of this issue in the scholarship. There are, however, two\\n', 'exceptions. Lex Newman (2007), in a footnote responds to this passage in Locke:\\n', 'Every one finds in himself, that he knows the Ideas he has; That he knows also, when any one is\\n', 'in his Understanding, and what it is; And that when more than one are there he knows them\\n', 'distinctly and unconfusedly one from another. Which always being so, (it being impossible but\\n', 'that he should perceive what he perceives,) he can never be in doubt when any Idea is in his\\n', 'Mind, that it is there, and is that Idea it is; and that two distinct Ideas, when they are in his\\n', 'Mind, are there, and are not one and the same Idea.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.vii.4)\\n', 'Here Locke distinguishes three different kinds of knowledge falling under the category\\n', 'of identity and diversity: (1) we know “when any one [idea] is in the understanding,”\\n', 'which Locke glosses as “that it is there”; (2) we know “what it [the idea] is,” namely that\\n', 'it “is the Idea it is”; and (3) when more than one idea is in the mind, we know that they\\n', '“are not one and the same idea.” Since we are concerned only with knowing the\\n', 'identity of an idea and not its diversity from other ideas, I will consider only (1) and\\n', '(2): knowing that an idea is in the mind and knowing what the idea is. Here is how\\n', 'Newman explains those agreements:\\n', 'Locke writes that a man “can never be in doubt when any Idea is in his Mind, that it is there,”\\n', 'explaining this by appeal to “it being impossible but that he should perceive what he perceives”\\n', '(E IV.vii.4). But this leaves unclear how such truths count as agreements between ideas. An\\n', 'explanation is suggested in connection with his Book II discussion of perception: “What\\n', 'Perception is, everyone will know better by reflecting on what he does himself, when he sees,\\n', 'hears, feels, etc.”—that is, “reflects on what passes in his own Mind” (E II.ix.2: 143). This\\n', 'implies that the general idea of perception subsumes all manner of occurring ideas, thereby\\n', 'suggesting how to formulate the relevant agreement. Suppose a sensation of red is occurring in\\n', 'my mind. To know that that idea is presently occurring—that it is in the present contents of\\n', 'consciousness—is to perceive an agreement between that idea and my general idea of percep-\\n', 'tion. (To know, in addition, that the occurring sensation is of red is to perceive, in addition, an agreement between that idea of sensation and my general idea of red.)25\\n', 'Newman argues that the agreement in knowing (1) is between the idea (any idea) and\\n', 'a general idea of perception, and in perceiving that agreement we know “that an idea\\n', 'is presently occurring” (my emphasis). Knowing (2) “that the occurring sensation is\\n', 'of red,” namely what the idea is, Newman argues, consists in perceiving an agreement\\n', 'between the “idea of sensation and my general idea of red.” Although I concur that\\n', 'when we know an idea, we seem to know both that the idea is in the mind and what\\n', 'the idea is (as stated in the IV.vii.4 passage), here are some reasons to be suspicious\\n', 'that the agreements are as Newman describes them. First, Newman’s view requires\\n', '25 Newman (2007: 328, n 18).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'that we already have several general or abstract ideas before we can have knowledge\\n', 'of the identity of an idea. So, prior to knowing the identity of my idea red, I must have\\n', 'a general idea of perception, and I must have a general idea of red. But this conflicts\\n', 'with Locke’s claim in the rest of the passage from IV.vii.4 that we know the identity of\\n', 'each and every idea just upon perceiving it—that it is “the first Act of the Mind, . . . to\\n', 'know every one of its Ideas by it self.” We find virtually the same statement in IV.i.4:\\n', 'First, as to the first sort of agreement or disagreement, viz. identity or diversity. It is the first act of the mind, when it has any sentiments or ideas at all, to perceive its ideas; and so far as it\\n', 'perceives them, to know each what it is, and thereby also to perceive their difference, and that\\n', 'one is not another. This is so absolutely necessary, that without it there could be no knowledge,\\n', 'no reasoning, no imagination, no distinct thoughts at all.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.i.4)\\n', 'Clearly implied here is that we know the identity of an idea, say, the idea red, prior to\\n', 'having generated an abstract idea of red or even an abstract idea of perception. In\\n', 'addition, abstracting ideas requires a higher-order mental act that is absent in young\\n', 'children. Newman’s interpretation would lead to the odd conclusion that young\\n', 'children have no first-order knowledge that they are having ideas, nor what those\\n', 'ideas are. Or to accommodate that children do have knowledge of their own ideas, it\\n', 'would be suggestive of there being innate ideas of perception and of red that are\\n', 'already in the mind to be compared. But we know what Locke has to say about innate\\n', 'ideas. This, on top of Locke’s clear statement that “the first Act of the Mind, . . . to\\n', 'know every one of its Ideas by it self,” leads me to conclude that Locke must have\\n', 'something different in mind.\\n', '\\n', 'Another exception is Nicholas Wolterstorff (1996: 20–1), who argues that con-\\n', 'trary to his “official” position, Locke “actually” held the view that we know our own\\n', 'ideas, mental acts, and perhaps ourselves as constituents of facts prior to proposi-\\n', 'tions. “Locke’s official doctrine [is] that, from among all the facts that there are,\\n', 'those of which one is directly aware consist of ideas-in-relation; it was also his\\n', 'doctrine that propositions consist of ideas-in-relation” (1996: 20). But “Locke’s\\n', 'actual view, as distinguished from his official view, was that the facts available to\\n', 'one for one’s ‘perception’ have not only one’s own ideas as their constituents but\\n', 'also one’s mental acts, and perhaps one’s self ” (1996: 21). Like Wolterstorff, I take\\n', 'it that internal to a complex perceptual state are the perceptual act and the idea (i.e.\\n', '\\n', 'the perception of an idea) and the consciousness of myself as perceiving it.\\n', '\\n', 'Nevertheless, I am defending Locke’s official view. I take Locke at his word that\\n', 'knowing an idea is a species of knowledge, which consists in knowing an agree-\\n', 'ment. And consistent with Newman, I will argue that knowing the identity of an\\n', 'idea is to know two agreements—one consisting in the knowledge that the idea is in\\n', 'the mind and one consisting in the knowledge what the idea is. Since all knowledge\\n', 'is propositional, when we know our own ideas, we know a true proposition, in this\\n', 'case a proposition expressing both agreements.

In order to\\n', 'distinguish the representational function of ideas sufficiently from the knowledge we\\n', 'have of our own ideas, I provide, first, a brief explanation of how ideas are represen-\\n', 'tational. In section 3.I.2, I give a textual argument for why we should see Locke as\\n', 'having some forms of knowledge conveyed as the result of other perceptual acts.\\n', '\\n', 'Here we see that, for Locke, knowing that ideas are as we perceive them, namely\\n', 'knowing the agreements therein, is the result of the complexity involved in perceiv-\\n', 'ing ideas.

That the account may prove to be somewhat\\n', 'peculiar, Locke has already given us fair warning. Perceptions of ideas are propositional\\n', '29 Forrai (2005: 46). Forrai mentions his agreement with Yolton (1984), which I take to be that Locke has an “act-content . . . analysis of perception.” “Idea” is simply Locke’s term for “cognitive content”\\n', '(Yolton 1975: 384). Chappell (1994: 33) concurs, saying of Yolton, his “point here is well-taken: many philosophers since Yolton have found the notion of ‘content’ to be helpful in the effort to comprehend human mentality. In current work in philosophical psychology, the term most frequently used to convey the same notion is ‘intentional object.’” Neither Chappell, nor, I think, Forrai, nor I agree with Yolton that Locke thinks acts of perception are the same as ideas. Hoffman (2002: 174), in what I think is a terrific article, argues that in some early moderns (in this case Descartes and Arnauld) the line between\\n', 'representationalism and direct realism is not drawn where we, perhaps, think it is: “A theory of perception that held that we perceive external objects by perceiving the content intrinsic to acts of perception would still be representationalist, because that intrinsic content would be serving as an intermediate object.”\\n', '30 As we will see in section 3.I.5, the structural complexity of the perception of an idea also results in knowledge of our own existence. I suggest that Locke’s account of our intuitive knowledge of necessary coexistence also has some similar features:\\n', 'Our knowledge in all these Enquiries, reaches very little farther than our Experience. Indeed,\\n', 'some few of the primary qualities have a necessary dependence, and visible connection one\\n', 'with another, as Figure necessarily supposes Extension, receiving or communicating\\n', 'Motion by impulse, supposes Solidity. But though these, and perhaps some others of our\\n', 'Ideas have: yet there are so few of them, that have a visible Connexion one with another, that\\n', 'we can by Intuition or Demonstration, discover the co-existence of very few of the Qualities\\n', 'are to be found united in Substances.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.iii.14)\\n', 'Here Locke seems to be claiming that the psychological unavoidability of the simultaneity of the ideas in the mind, “their visible connection with one another,” namely our experience of the structural complexity of the mental state, is what results in intuitive knowledge of necessary co-existence.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'in that they have structured content the perception of which constitutes knowing an idea.\\n', '\\n', 'One might wonder whether and why anything more needs to be said.

Two pieces of this puzzle have already been\\n', 'mentioned. First, for Locke, perceptions of ideas are complex propositional states in\\n', 'which there is more than just the idea perceived. Second, in order to have intuitive\\n', 'knowledge all that is required is that the constituents of the agreement are before the\\n', 'mind. In this section, I provide argumentation establishing this latter point more\\n', 'clearly, especially as it pertains to knowing our ideas. Once we see that agreements\\n', 'can be known without having to engage in an additional mental act, the door is opened\\n', 'to understanding how we can have knowledge as internal to the perception of an idea.\\n', '\\n', 'To make the case that we have knowledge as the result of the complexity in\\n', 'perceiving an idea, let us start with Locke’s first statement concerning knowing the\\n', 'identity of an idea:\\n', 'First, As to the first sort of Agreement or Disagreement, viz. Identity, or Diversity. ’Tis the first Act of the Mind, when it has any Sentiments or Ideas at all, to perceive its Ideas; and so far as it perceives them, to know each what it is, and thereby also to perceive their difference, and that\\n', 'one is not another. This is so absolutely necessary, that without it there could be no Knowledge,\\n', 'no Reasoning, no Imagination, no distinct Thoughts at all.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.i.4)\\n', 'It is important, first, to acknowledge that in this passage Locke appears to be saying\\n', 'that I have intuitive knowledge of individual ideas. Insofar as I perceive an idea\\n', 'I “know each what it is,” and by knowing the identity of each idea, “thereby” I am able\\n', 'to know that it is diverse from any other.31 And if I could not be sure of the ideas\\n', 'I perceive, then I would not be able to know anything else.32 Similarly, in the passage\\n', '31 See also Gibson (1960: 24): “Each idea must be at once perceived to be what it is, and at the same time distinguished from all other ideas.” Of course, this does not mean that I do not also perceive the diversity of two ideas when explicitly compared.\\n', '\\n', '32 I suppose our earlier objector could dig in her heels by reading this passage as saying that knowing the identity of an idea is knowing that two idea tokens of a particular type are identical, which requires first perceiving the ideas. But that would be to deny that knowing an idea is anything more than merely having that idea in my mind. Moreover, it would be to deny a plausible reading of the passage in which Locke is equating knowing the identity of the idea with perceiving the idea. And only once I know the idea, its identity, can I know a difference between ideas.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'from IV.vii.4, Locke says that it is the first act of the mind “to know every one of its\\n', 'Ideas by it self.” Already we seem to have come across something quite surprising,\\n', 'namely that Locke seems to have room for knowledge that is an agreement, but\\n', 'somehow the agreement is perceived as a part of the perception of the idea. Note,\\n', 'however, that in IV.ix.3, a passage cited earlier in chapter two, Locke states that we\\n', 'have another form of intuitive knowledge on the basis of perceiving an idea: “In every\\n', 'Act of Sensation, Reasoning, or Thinking,” he says, “we are conscious to our selves of\\n', 'our own being; and in this Matter, come not short of the highest degree of Certainty.”\\n', 'So there is clear textual evidence in the Essay that Locke thinks we have at least two\\n', 'forms of knowledge (of our own ideas and of our own existence) conveyed with\\n', 'whatever is given in the perception of any idea.33\\n', 'As additional support, let me draw attention to Locke’s Book IV explanation of the\\n', 'different categories of agreements constituting knowledge. There, Locke seems to\\n', 'equate intuitively knowing our ideas with the mental operation of distinguishing\\n', 'ideas:\\n', 'the mind clearly and infallibly perceives each idea to agree with itself, and to be what it is; and all distinct ideas to disagree, i.e. the one not to be the other: and this it does without pains, labour, or deduction; but at first view by its natural power of Perception and Distinction. (IV.i.2)\\n', 'Here, Locke states that just in virtue of the mind’s natural power to perceive and\\n', 'distinguish ideas, we are able to know “clearly and infallibly,” their identity—that\\n', 'they are as we perceive them. Distinguishing ideas falls under the mental faculty of\\n', '“discerning,” which Locke describes in Book II as the mind “distinguishing between\\n', 'the several Ideas it has” (II.xi.1).34 In these passages, then, Locke is saying that\\n', 'discerning an idea, or what is the same, perceiving a distinct idea (distinguishing\\n', 'it) entails also knowing it intuitively. The explanation, I suggest, is that when\\n', 'I perceive (distinguish) an idea, I know that it is the idea it is—I know that there is\\n', 'an idea in my mind, and I know what it is. The intuitive knowledge of an idea is\\n', 'conveyed as a part of the perceptual act of distinguishing it. But distinguishing an\\n', 'idea is no more than to perceive it, which results in knowing it.\\n', '\\n', 'More support for this claim is found in Locke’s II.xxix.5 analysis of clear and\\n', 'distinct ideas, since here Locke states that all ideas are perceived distinctly.\\n', '\\n', '33 This does not preclude that owing to the kind of the idea perceived, we could know even more.\\n', '\\n', '34 See also Aaron (1971: 140), who asserts that “discerning is itself an instance of knowing.” He\\n', 'continues, “If the reader compares the account given of intuition in IV.ii.1 with that of discerning in II.xi.1, he will see that discerning is one instance of intuition.” Gibson (1960: 143) notes that the identity of an idea involves the “ability to identify and discriminate the contents of our ideas.” Ayers (1991: I, 98) acknowledges that “on Locke’s view the perception of the identity or diversity of ideas reduces to the\\n', '‘discerning’ or distinguishing of a single idea or two different ideas.” He continues, “Since we cannot have ideas without distinguishing them, the potentiality for a kind of propositional knowledge is bound up with the very having of ideas.”\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'For let an Idea be as it will, it can be no other but such as the Mind perceives it to be; and that very perception, sufficiently distinguishes it from all other Ideas, which cannot be other, i.e.\\n', '\\n', 'different, without being perceived to be so. No Idea therefore can be undistinguishable from\\n', 'another, from which it ought to be different, unless you would have it different from itself. (II.xxix.5)\\n', '\\n', 'Note that Locke’s use of the phrase “[an idea] can be no other but such as the Mind\\n', 'perceives it to be” to describe having a distinct idea is almost identical to the way in\\n', 'which he describes the intuitive knowledge of our own ideas in IV.ii.1. There he says,\\n', '“For a Man cannot conceive himself capable of a greater Certainty, than to know that\\n', 'any Idea in his Mind is such, as he perceives it to be.” So, in four different chapters,\\n', 'two from Book II and two from Book IV, we find Locke equating perceiving an idea,\\n', 'perceiving it distinctly, and knowing its identity. This is strong textual evidence that\\n', 'whatever components constituting the agreement in knowing an idea are somehow\\n', 'present in the mind along with the idea, such that in perceiving it I also have\\n', 'knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'In fact, knowing my own ideas and my own existence is not the only kind of\\n', 'intuitive knowledge conveyed as a part of simply having the constituents of the\\n', 'agreement in the mind. Locke confirms, in this next passage, that we know agree-\\n', 'ments just in virtue of comparing ideas, which I take to mean merely having them\\n', 'juxtaposed:\\n', 'For in this [intuitive knowledge] the mind is at no pains of proving or examining, but perceives\\n', 'the truth as the eye doth light, only by being directed towards it. Thus the mind perceives that\\n', 'white is not black, that a circle is not a triangle, that three are more than two and equal to one\\n', 'and two. Such kinds of truths the mind perceives at the first sight of the ideas together, by bare\\n', 'intuition; without the intervention of any other idea: and this kind of knowledge is the clearest\\n', 'and most certain that human frailty is capable of.  (IV.ii.1)\\n', '\\n', 'Here Locke explains that just in virtue of having the ideas together in the mind I can\\n', 'know an agreement. The mind perceives the truth at “first sight of the ideas together.”\\n', 'And it seems that Locke is saying that it is this perception that constitutes intuitive\\n', 'knowledge. Therefore, intuitively knowing agreements or disagreements (as\\n', 'described in the passage above) seems not to require a mental act in addition to\\n', 'perceiving the ideas together in the mind. Similarly, it seems reasonable to conclude\\n', 'that having intuitive knowledge of our own ideas requires nothing more than having\\n', 'whatever constitutes that agreement together in the mind.35 Owen (1999: 47) states\\n', '35 Locke does not say much about comparing ideas except for its role in how we come to have ideas of relations: “The comparing them one with another, in respect of Extent, Degrees, Time, Place, or any other Circumstances, is another operation of the mind about its Ideas, and is that upon which depends all that large tribe of Ideas, comprehended under Relation” (II.xi.4). In the chapter on ideas of relations, however, Locke describes the comparing of ideas as when “the Mind thus brings two things together, and, as it were, takes a view of them at once” (II.xxv.1). Regardless of whether comparison in this case is voluntary or not, the important part of generating anything new as the result of it is that the relevant ideas are juxtaposed (appear together) in the mind.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'the case this way: “there is no distinction between perceiving the agreement or\\n', 'disagreement of ideas, forming the proposition, and knowing it to be true.” On the\\n', 'basis of the textual evidence, I am taking a further step by suggesting that in the case\\n', 'of intuitive knowledge there is no gap between comparing or distinguishing (per-\\n', 'ceiving) ideas, perceiving the agreement, forming the proposition, and knowing it to\\n', 'be true.36 That is, having intuitive knowledge need not require anything other than\\n', 'having the agreeing elements juxtaposed in the mind.37 And if so, then as long as the\\n', 'constituents of the agreement perceived in knowing the identity of an idea are a part\\n', 'of the structural complexity in perceiving an idea, I can have that knowledge as a part\\n', 'of that complex mental state.\\n', '\\n', '3.I.3 Knowledge of an Idea as Propositional\\n', '\\n', 'Locke does not specifically consider the nature of the proposition expressing the\\n', 'identity of an idea. Nevertheless, despite their self-evidence, I think we can rule out\\n', 'analytic or what he calls “trifling” propositions. That Locke has little use for these\\n', 'sorts of propositions is quite clear:\\n', 'What is this more than trifling with Words? It is but like a Monkey shifting his Oyster from\\n', 'one hand to the other; and had he had but Words, might, no doubt, have said, Oyster in right\\n', 'hand is Subject, and Oyster in left hand is Predicate: and so might have made a self-evident\\n', 'Proposition of Oyster, i.e. Oyster is Oyster; and yet, with all this, not have been one whit the\\n', 'wiser, or more knowing. (IV.vii.3)\\n', '\\n', 'Surely, our knowledge of our own ideas cannot be the result of tautological proposi-\\n', 'tions that impart nothing substantive, for Locke considers this kind of (propositional)\\n', 'knowledge foundational. That is, intuitively knowing each idea “by itself,” says Locke,\\n', 'is foundational not only to perceiving tautologies but also to perceiving any other\\n', 'agreement or disagreement of ideas:\\n', '\\n', 'For, First, the immediate perception of the agreement or disagreement of Identity, being\\n', 'founded in the Mind’s having distinct Ideas, this affords us as many self-evident Propositions,\\n', 'as we have distinct Ideas. Every one that has any Knowledge at all, has, as the Foundation of it\\n', 'various and distinct Ideas: And it is the first Act of the Mind, (without which, it can never be\\n', 'capable of any Knowledge,) to know every one of its Ideas by itself, and distinguish it from\\n', 'others. (IV.vii.4)\\n', '\\n', '36 Marušić (2014: 266) seems to be taking this view when she says, “Affirming, I propose, is a way of combining ideas because it is taking ideas to stand in some relation. Taking ideas to stand in some relation is, in effect, a way of connecting or combining them. Similarly, denying is a way of separating ideas because it is taking them not to stand in some relation.”\\n', '37 This is not to preclude that having knowledge might require some degree of attention. Locke often equates attending to our ideas with “taking notice” of them, which is necessary for having both ideas of sensation (II.ix.4) and ideas of reflection (II.i.4, II.i.7). I will have more to say (as well as text to cite) about the role it plays in knowing our own ideas at the end of section 3.I.4.\\n', '\\n', 'Locke reiterates this distinction between the foundational work done in knowing an\\n', 'idea and the vacuity of self-evident identity (or “trifling”) propositions, which\\n', 'contribute nothing to the advancement of knowledge:\\n', 'These [propositions like ‘white is white’] obviously, and at first blush, appear to contain no\\n', 'instruction in them. For when we affirm the same Term of itself, whether it be barely verbal, or\\n', 'whether it contains any clear and real Idea, it shows us nothing, but what we must certainly\\n', 'know before, whether such a Proposition be either made by, or proposed to us. (IV.viii.2)\\n', '\\n', 'Here, we can see Locke distinguishing between an initial foundational intuitive know-\\n', 'ledge of our own ideas and a subsequent, derivative, and trivial assertion, whether\\n', 'mental or verbal, of what we already know.38 Therefore, the intuitive knowledge we\\n', 'have of each and every individual idea is a precondition for all other knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'If the propositional knowledge conveyed in perceiving an idea is not analytic, then\\n', 'what is it? Well, first, let us see how Locke usually expresses our knowledge of the\\n', 'identity of an idea. He uses several propositions to describe what we know. For\\n', 'example, sometimes we find “the idea is the idea it is.” This one, I suggest, is not as\\n', 'helpful, for it resembles the kind of trifling propositions that Locke has little use for.\\n', '\\n', 'But often he says, “the idea is as I am perceiving it to be” or “the idea is what it is.” In\\n', 'the “Epistle to the Reader” we find Locke’s very similar description: “I mean some\\n', 'object in the Mind, and consequently determined, i.e. such as it is there seen and\\n', 'perceived to be” (1975: 13).\\n', '\\n', 'Second, I suggest that according to Locke’s taxonomy, we can see this proposition\\n', 'as expressing a “real mental truth,” namely the agreement expressed is such that its\\n', 'constituents signify real things “capable of having an Existence in Nature” (II.v.8).\\n', '\\n', 'Moreover, Locke’s contrast class to “real” mental truths consists in propositions in\\n', 'which the signifiers stand for fictional things, like “Harpies and Centaurs” (IV.v.7).\\n', '\\n', 'In the mental truth, “the idea is as I am perceiving it to be,” the things signified\\n', '(perhaps the idea and consciousness) are real things and not fictions like harpies and\\n', 'centaurs. The existing idea stands for itself—a real thing certainly, but not a real thing\\n', 'outside (or in addition to and represented by) the idea.39 Likewise, my experience\\n', '38 Importantly, Locke is placing the standard for knowledge in the mental faculty itself rather than in, say, a syllogistic model of reasoning, which is not uncommon among some of the early moderns. Owen\\n', '(1999: 4), argues that characteristic of Descartes, Locke, and Hume is the rejection of any importance given to syllogistic reasoning: “The focus is not the validity of argument so much as the activity of the faculty of reason (ideas), and the activities performed by the faculty on those materials.” Owen then cites Hatfield (1997: 22): “The early modern rejection of Aristotelian logic can then be seen as reflecting a negative assessment of the fit between the syllogism and logic considered as an art of reasoning that refines the use of the cognitive faculties.”\\n', '39 In further distinguishing truth from falsehood Locke states, “And so far as these Ideas, thus marked by Sounds, agree to their Archetypes, so far only is the Truth real” (IV.v.9). This should remind us of Locke’s II.xxx classification of ideas as “real” when they agree to their “archetypes.” I suggest that Locke’s understanding of the agreement of an idea to itself is similar to an agreement of an idea of a mode or relation to its archetype: “These Ideas, being themselves Archetypes, cannot differ from their Archetypes, and so cannot be chimerical, unless anyone will jumble together in them inconsistent Ideas” (II.xxx.4). of an I perceiving signifies itself—consciousness as internal to the perception of\\n', 'the idea.40\\n', 'Third, we can look to Locke’s II.xxxii analysis of the truth and falsity of ideas for\\n', 'more help. There, Locke distinguishes two ways in which we can speak of ideas as\\n', 'true or false. On the one hand, ideas can be true or false in the “ordinary Accepta-\\n', 'tion,” which is when we refer an idea to something else such that we can affirm or\\n', 'deny conformity of the idea to that thing. The three most common cases are the\\n', 'reference of an idea in my mind to an idea in another person’s mind, the reference of\\n', 'an idea to some “real existence,” and the reference of an idea to a “real Constitution,\\n', 'and essence of any thing” (II.xxxii.5). On the other hand, and this is the one we are\\n', 'interested in, an idea can be true in what Locke calls the “metaphysical sense of the\\n', 'Word Truth”:\\n', 'as all other Things, that any way exist, are said to be true; i.e. really to be such as they exist.\\n', '\\n', 'Though in Things called true even in that Sense, there is, perhaps a secret reference to our\\n', 'Ideas, look’d upon as the Standards of that Truth, which amounts to a mental Proposition,\\n', 'though it be usually not taken notice of. (II.xxxii.2)\\n', '\\n', 'This locution, that an idea is “really to be such as it exists,” is remarkably similar to\\n', 'those propositions Locke uses (just mentioned above) to describe what we know\\n', 'when we have intuitive knowledge of the identity of an idea. Perhaps it is fair to say\\n', 'that when I perceive an idea, it is “metaphysically” true, and I know it intuitively.\\n', '\\n', 'Moreover, Locke asserts that ideas in themselves, “being only so many . . . appear-\\n', 'ances there [in the mind],” cannot be false.41 So, there is a mental proposition that\\n', 'expresses the reason why ideas deserve to be affirmed as true—the reason why they\\n', 'cannot be misidentified. This reason is the agreement constitutive of the truth of an\\n', 'idea. This truth, expressed by the proposition “the idea is as it exists in my mind” or\\n', 'by the proposition “the idea is as I perceive it to be,” is known as the result of\\n', 'perceiving an idea.\\n', '\\n', 'What, though, should we make of Locke’s claim that “perhaps there is a secret\\n', 'reference . . . to our Ideas . . . as the Standards of that Truth” and that the mental\\n', 'proposition is “usually not taken notice of ”? I suggest that because the perception\\n', 'of an idea is a complex propositional state, we can know that proposition insofar as\\n', 'we perceive the idea. The agreeing elements as found together in the complex\\n', 'propositional state constitute the “secret reference” of the idea to itself: Insofar as\\n', 'the elements internal to the propositional state stand to each other, the idea can be\\n', '40 Although insofar as it is a mental state, consciousness is a real thing in the mind, I will argue in chapter four that Locke sees consciousness not only as a mental state in which I am aware of an I perceiving, but also the ongoing self that I am aware of in that mental state.\\n', '\\n', '41 “And so I say, that the Ideas in our Minds being only so many Perceptions, or Appearances there, none of them are false. The Idea of a Centaur, having no more Falsehood in it, when it appears in our Minds; than the Name Centaur has Falsehood in it, when it is pronounced by our Mouths, or written on Paper” (II.xxxii.3).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'seen to stand to itself. When Locke says that the proposition “is not usually tak[en]\\n', 'notice of ” we can see him as distinguishing what constitutes the truth of the idea\\n', 'from what constitutes our knowledge of that truth. I suggest that insofar as we “take\\n', 'notice” of the ideas we are perceiving, we know the agreement expressed in the true\\n', 'proposition.\\n', '\\n', 'Locke does not say specifically that having knowledge requires that we attend to\\n', 'our mental states, but he does say that “taking notice” of our mental states is\\n', 'required for the production of ideas of sensation (II.ix.4) and of ideas of reflection\\n', '(II.i.4, II.i.7). If some degree of attention is required for passively receiving ideas of\\n', 'sensation, then it is reasonable to think that having knowledge of our own ideas\\n', '(or having knowledge of any other agreement) requires it too. In all three cases,\\n', 'though, Locke seems to see attention as a way of engaging in an act of perception\\n', 'rather than constituting an additional perception. This seems to be confirmed in\\n', 'II.xix.3 when Locke “digresses” from his explication of the modes of thinking to\\n', 'mention “Attention, Revery, and Dreaming,” which are described as “different\\n', 'state[s] of the Mind in thinking.” For example, “the mind employs it self about\\n', 'them [its perceptions of ideas] with several different degrees of Attention. Some-\\n', 'times the mind fixes it self with so much earnestness on the Contemplation of\\n', 'some Objects. . . . At other times, it barely observes the train of Ideas.” Presumably,\\n', 'perceiving an agreement can fall anywhere on this scale.

Similarly, because perceptions of ideas are propos-\\n', 'itional states, insofar as I take notice of the idea I am perceiving, I will know that\\n', 'proposition. It is time now to turn to the agreeing elements constituting the truth\\n', 'of the proposition known.\\n', '\\n', '3.I.4 The Agreement in Knowing an Idea\\n', 'Knowledge is the perception of an agreement or disagreement of ideas expressed in\\n', 'a true proposition. I have argued that perceptions of ideas are complex propos-\\n', 'itional states; I have argued that Locke thinks ideas are true in what he calls a\\n', '“metaphysical sense of the word truth,” and I have argued that there is a family of\\n', 'propositions that express that truth, the best articulation of which is “the idea is as\\n', 'I am perceiving it to be.” It is time now to see what the truth of an idea consists in\\n', 'such that the foregoing proposition adequately expresses it.

Important to keep in mind, as we move through these arguments, is that\\n', 'perceptions of ideas are complex mental states with distinct constituent elements.\\n', '\\n', 'And any agreeing elements therein can be known intuitively to agree as a part of the\\n', 'complex mental state. As I argued in chapter two, consciousness is a constituent of\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'every perception of an idea.42 But Locke also states clearly that every idea is\\n', 'accompanied by an idea of existence:\\n', 'Existence and Unity, are two other Ideas, that are suggested to the Understanding, by every\\n', 'Object without, and every Idea within. When Ideas are in our Minds, we consider them as\\n', 'being actually there, as well as we consider things to be actually without us; which is, that they\\n', 'exist, or have Existence.\\n', '\\n', '(II.vii.7)\\n', 'Here and elsewhere in II.vii, Locke tells us that simple ideas of existence (along with\\n', 'ideas of pleasure, pain, power, and unity) “are suggested” (II.vii.7), “join themselves”\\n', '(II.vii.2), or are “annexed” (II.vii.6) to all of our other ideas. I take this to mean that\\n', 'when we perceive any idea, simultaneously we also perceive an idea of existence.\\n', '\\n', 'Therefore, also constituent in the complex mental state that is the perception of an\\n', 'idea is an idea of existence. We now have three different constituents of the perception\\n', 'of any idea: the idea perceived, an idea of existence, and the consciousness that I am\\n', 'perceiving them.\\n', '\\n', 'What is more, in II.vii.7 above, Locke tells us that because the idea of existence is\\n', '“annexed” to any idea, whenever we perceive an idea we have the experience of that\\n', 'idea as existing in the mind.43 He says, I “consider them [the idea] as actually being\\n', 'there.” So, the simultaneity of the idea perceived and the idea of existence grounds\\n', 'the knowledge that the idea is there.

Mattern applies this conclusion to resolve the apparent conflict between\\n', 'the general definition of knowledge and Locke’s description of sensitive knowledge as\\n', '“an actual real Existence agreeing to an Idea” (IV.i.7).

It is . . . what Locke . . . terms the ‘grounds of Affirmation and Negation’”\\n', '(E IV.i.7: 527). But in the former case, which Mattern (1978: 693) calls “idea-theoretic”\\n', 'truths, “the two sorts of agreement coincide; the relation between ideas is both the state\\n', 'rendering the proposition true and the state of the proposition expressing this truth.”\\n', 'Applying this argument to a case of knowing an idea, namely an “idea-theoretic truth,”\\n', 'we can see our knowledge of an idea as grounded in the state of affairs that renders the\\n', 'idea (“metaphysically”) true, but at the same time it is also the agreement expressed in\\n', 'the structure or composition of the proposition itself.48\\n', 'Perhaps now is the time to consider a few possible objections. First, one might\\n', 'wonder whether I have actually succeeded in showing that intuitive knowledge of our\\n', 'own ideas is consistent with Locke’s definition of knowledge. For example, Newman\\n', '(2004, 2007) argues that knowledge, for Locke, consists only in a perception of an\\n', 'agreement between two ideas. Rickless (2008: 86) cites the following passage from\\n', 'IV.i.5 as the most persuasive of the same claim, since it seems to say that there is “no\\n', 'room” for any kind of agreement that is not between two ideas: “There could be no\\n', 'room for any positive Knowledge at all, if we could not perceive any Relation between\\n', 'our Ideas, and find out the Agreement or Disagreement, they have one with another,\\n', 'in several ways the Mind takes of comparing them.” I do not think we have to see the\\n', 'interpretation I have offered as conflicting with these passages. One reason is that the\\n', 'latter is found in the section in which Locke is describing only our knowledge of\\n', 'general truths as covered in the specific category of “Relation in general.” When\\n', 'describing these relations Locke usually refers to mathematical or moral relations,\\n', 'which are primarily known through demonstrations. But as already noted, knowing\\n', 'the identity of an idea (and of our own existence and even of the existence of an\\n', 'external object) is an instance of having knowledge of a particular thing, which\\n', 'perhaps calls for a different, yet by and large consistent, explanation. And as Locke\\n', 'has warned us in IV.i.7, these are “peculiar ways of agreements.” But more to the\\n', 'point, I do not think my interpretation disagrees with Locke’s definition of know-\\n', 'ledge, since there is the perception of an agreement of ideas, even if there is more to\\n', 'the agreement that just what we get from those two ideas.49\\n', '48 Rickless (2008: 90) argues against taking Mattern’s account to solve the problem of sensitive knowledge, because what is taken to agree is not the ideas in the proposition, but the underlying extra-mental entities signified by the ideas. This is no problem for my interpretation, since his argument does not apply equally to “idea-theoretic truths.”\\n', '49 The structure of the agreement in knowing the existence of an external object will be shown (in\\n', 'part II) to be structurally similar in that there is more to the agreement than just what we get from the agreeing ideas.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'Second, there might be a different, yet related objection: my account of the\\n', 'proposition in knowing an idea conflicts with Locke’s IV.5 account of truth. Locke\\n', 'says that truth is “the joining or separating of Signs, as the Things signified by them,\\n', 'do agree or disagree one with another” (IV.5.2) and that “Truth properly belongs\\n', 'only to Propositions” (IV.5.2). Thus, the objection would be that a true proposition\\n', 'must be the joining of signs, either ideas or words. It cannot be, as I have argued, the\\n', 'joining of constituents of the complex mental state of perceiving an idea, since one of\\n', 'those three constituents is consciousness. I suggest, however, that Locke leaves room\\n', 'for just such an interpretation. At the end of his discussion of true and false ideas in\\n', 'II.xxxii.19, Locke has this to say:\\n', 'Though in compliance with the ordinary way of Speaking, I have shewed in what sense, and\\n', 'upon what ground our Ideas may be sometimes called true, or false; yet if we look a little nearer\\n', 'into the matter in all cases, where any Idea is call’d true, or false, it is from some Judgment that the Mind makes, or is supposed to make, that is true, or false. For Truth, or Falshood, being\\n', 'never without some Affirmation, or Negation, Express, or Tacit, it is not to be found, but where\\n', 'signs are joined or separated, according to the agreement, or disagreement, of the Things they\\n', 'stand for. The signs we chiefly use, are either Ideas, or Words, wherewith we make either\\n', 'mental, or verbal Propositions.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxxii.19)\\n', 'Notice that when we look very closely into the grounds of truth or falsity (whether it is\\n', 'the “ordinary way of Speaking” or the metaphysical sense) what constitutes the truth\\n', 'of an idea is due to “some [true] judgment the mind makes.” Moreover, the signs we\\n', 'use to compose those propositions, Locke says, are “chiefly” ideas and words. There-\\n', 'fore, there can be cases in which a sign used to form the proposition is not an idea or a\\n', 'word. Therefore, it can be consciousness, an awareness of an I perceiving.\\n', '\\n', 'Third, one might want to accept the spirit of my interpretation but at the same\\n', 'time press the foregoing objection by arguing that there are other ways to interpret\\n', 'knowing an idea, ways perhaps that are more in keeping with the assumption that the\\n', 'proposition known is a common identity statement.50 For example, we might see\\n', 'Locke as saying that when there is an idea in the mind I know its truth by comparing\\n', 'that idea with another idea. For example, the comparison would be of the original\\n', 'idea white with another idea white, say from memory. But if this is Locke’s view, then\\n', 'his account of the intuitive knowledge of our own ideas as “foundational” cannot get\\n', 'off the ground, for we would need already a standard in the mind by which to make\\n', 'the comparison and perceive the identity (agreement). This would also threaten\\n', 'Locke’s empiricism.\\n', '\\n', 'Another possible explanation (in the form of an objection) is that when we perceive\\n', 'and distinguish an idea, the mind duplicates or re-presents the idea so that there can\\n', '50 As mentioned earlier, virtually no one has provided an account of the proposition known (and the agreement perceived) when we have intuitive knowledge of our own ideas. Most, I suspect have not\\n', 'thought much about it or have merely assumed that the agreement perceived is between two tokens of an idea type. The following objections are some I see possible.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'be a comparison between them. But this seems an unlikely scenario considering\\n', 'Locke’s derogatory view of “identity propositions” (IV.viii.2). Thus, we can see this\\n', 'disparaging attitude extending to mental propositions formed and agreements per-\\n', 'ceived as the result of a re-presentation of an idea. In addition, in the IV.i.4 explan-\\n', 'ation of our knowledge of the agreement of identity, just after he says that we know\\n', 'ideas individually, Locke denies that “any maxim or Proposition in the World [would]\\n', 'make him know it clearer or surer than he did before.” If it is Locke’s view that\\n', 'knowing the identity of an idea consists in re-presenting the idea and then perceiving\\n', 'an agreement between the original and the re-presentation, then surely this would be a\\n', 'case in which a proposition is generated to affirm what we already seem to know about\\n', 'the original idea. Furthermore, to assign to Locke a re-presentation interpretation\\n', 'would saddle him with the psychologically implausible view that the mind engages in\\n', 'the task of double-checking its ideas in order to know that they really are as we\\n', 'perceive them. Charity would frown on such a move.\\n', '\\n', 'Finally, if the identity perceived in the re-presentation view is interpreted as the\\n', 'perception of resemblance between a particular idea and a re-presentation of itself,\\n', 'then knowing the identity of an idea is no different from knowing any other relation.\\n', '\\n', 'But Locke himself, already cited from IV.i.7 in the introduction to this chapter,\\n', 'makes a point of distinguishing the agreement of identity from agreements, like\\n', 'resemblance, that fall into the category of relation in general. Owen (1999: 41)\\n', 'analyzes the peculiarity this way: “Identity is distinct because it is primordial and\\n', 'fundamental to our awareness of ideas.”\\n', 'Given everything said, I suggest that there are sufficient reasons to accept the\\n', 'interpretation I have put forward.\\n', '\\n', '3.I.5. An Analogous Case: Knowing I Exist\\n', 'As mentioned earlier, Locke’s version of the cogito argument includes the claim that\\n', 'we have intuitive knowledge of our own existence conveyed in the act of perceiving\\n', 'any idea:\\n', 'As for our own Existence, we perceive it so plainly, and so certainly, that it neither needs, nor is capable of any proof. For nothing can be more evident to us, than our own Existence. I think,\\n', 'I reason, I feel Pleasure and Pain; Can any of these be more evident to me, than my own\\n', 'Existence? . . . Experience then convinces us, that we have an intuitive Knowledge of our own\\n', 'Existence, and an internal infallible Perception that we are. In every Act of Sensation,\\n', 'Reasoning, or Thinking, we are conscious to our selves of our own Being; and, in this Matter,\\n', 'come not short of the highest degree of Certainty.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ix.3)\\n', 'Locke asserts first that we perceive our own existence “plainly,” “certainly,” and\\n', 'without any need of proof. He says, “I think, I reason, I feel Pleasure and Pain; Can\\n', 'any of these be more evident to me, than my own Existence?” Knowing that we exist\\n', 'is just as certain and evident to us as knowing the ideas in our own minds: the\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'analogy is to the intuitive knowledge of our own ideas. Second, we know that we exist\\n', 'in virtue of any act of thinking, for Locke, “having ideas” (II.i.9). Third, it is important\\n', 'that he does not say that knowing my own existence requires anything in addition to\\n', 'what is presently in my mind. Neither does he say that the knowledge is inferred in a\\n', 'separate act of the mind. Thus, there are very good reasons to conclude that we have\\n', 'certain non-inferential knowledge of our own existence as a part of perceiving an idea.\\n', '\\n', 'In the perception of an idea I know intuitively that I exist.51\\n', 'If we try to provide the same sort of analysis here as we did in knowing our own\\n', 'ideas, then there must be a proposition whose stated agreement expresses what makes\\n', 'the proposition true. And in perceiving any idea we know that truth. In a way that is a\\n', 'analogous, then, to how in perceiving an idea, I know the truth of the idea—that “it is\\n', 'as I am perceiving it to be,” in perceiving an idea I know the truth of my existence—\\n', 'that the “I perceiving exists.” To see this, consider again Locke’s analysis of knowing an\\n', 'idea: we know that an idea exists in the mind and we know that what is presented in\\n', 'the mind is as we perceive it. Explaining these aspects of knowing an idea required that\\n', 'we isolate the three (simultaneous) constituents of any perception of an idea: an idea\\n', 'perceived, an idea of existence, and consciousness (an I perceiving). As the result of all\\n', 'three constituents in the mind simultaneously, there is an agreement of mental\\n', 'content—a state of affairs—expressed in any of a family of propositions Locke uses\\n', 'when he speaks of knowing an idea. Similarly, knowing that “I exist” is the result of\\n', 'perceiving any idea, because of the simultaneity of the same trio of constituents—the\\n', 'same mental content, most specifically the idea of existence and consciousness. So,\\n', 'when I perceive an idea, just as I have the intuitive knowledge that “the idea is as I am\\n', 'perceiving it to be,” I also have the intuitive knowledge that “I exist as perceiving an\\n', 'idea”—or more simply, that I exist.

Problematically, our sensory ideas\\n', 'are not immune to error.\\n', '\\n', 'In addition, it seems that we have everyday experience of being mistaken about our\\n', 'own ideas.

It might be helpful, first, to look at the context in\\n', 'which Locke makes the above statements to Stillingfleet. These statements are in\\n', 'response to Stillingfleet’s insistence that Locke has not proved the existence of God by\\n', 'the use of ideas, but by the use of reason, namely by employing innately known\\n', '“principles of reason” (Locke 1823, iv: 56). Just following the first passage in question,\\n', 'Locke (1823, iv: 57) rephrases Stillingfleet’s objection as follows: “What! Can the\\n', 'grounds of our certainty arise from the idea of ourselves? No, certainly.” To which\\n', 'Locke “with due respect” replies, “Yes, certainly. The certainty of the being of a God\\n', 'is grounded on the idea of ourselves as we are thinking beings.” Locke (1823, iv: 58)\\n', '56 Interestingly, Gassendi tries to combat skepticism by arguing that the causes ideas identify are far enough up the causal chain to preclude error. LoLordo (2008: 718) explains, “Appearances are true, on Gassendi’s view, because they are fully accurate transcriptions of the information received at the end of the perceptual chain (e.g., the information the optic nerve carries to the brain). This information comes partly from the distal cause (the square tower), and partly from the way the information that cause provides is altered by the medium and mechanism of perception. Thus the appearances can be true, in the sense of conveying such information accurately, even when the distal object in question appears differently—square to the person close up, for example, and round to the person far away.” Although the way in which I am arguing that ideas are true for Locke is not insofar as they represent their causes, it is similar to Gassendi’s anti-skepticism in that the complexity of a perceptual act allows that there is no room for error in the agreement constituting the truth of the idea.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'continues, “My lord, I must confess I never thought, that the consideration of\\n', 'ourselves, and what we find in our own constitutions, excluded the consideration\\n', 'of the idea either of being or of thinking, two of the ideas that make a part of the\\n', 'complex idea a man has of him self.”57 Thus, the context of the passage, namely that\\n', 'the argument for the existence of God can begin with the complex idea of a human\\n', 'being as a thinking being, tells against the objection. For, first, Locke does allow that\\n', 'the perception of an idea leads to a proposition constituting knowledge: The consid-\\n', 'eration of a complex idea of ourselves can lead to a proposition containing ideas of\\n', 'thinking and being, ideas internal to the complex idea.\\n', '\\n', 'Second, when Locke says that knowledge “cannot be placed in any one single idea,”\\n', 'he means that knowledge is propositional. But that all knowledge is propositional is\\n', 'fully consistent with the interpretation I have given in which we perceive the truth of\\n', 'a proposition as the result of perceiving an idea—or, really, as the result of perceiving\\n', 'a constellation of mental content that includes two ideas. Indeed, it is somewhat\\n', 'analogous to Locke’s own example in which the truth of a proposition is perceived on\\n', 'the basis of perceiving all of the component elements contributing to the complexity\\n', 'of an idea.\\n', '\\n', 'Third, the context of the passage tells against the objection in another way. Locke’s\\n', 'statement that we cannot have knowledge with only one idea is in defense of his view\\n', 'that reason is a capacity of the mind employed about the ideas gained from sensation\\n', 'and reflection. Reason, for Locke, “perceives the necessary, and indubitable connex-\\n', 'ion of all the Ideas or Proofs one to another” (IV.xvii.2). Reason, therefore, is an\\n', 'ability of the mind to “cast about” for intermediate premises to help construct a\\n', 'demonstrative proof. It is not to be thought of as a stock of already known rational\\n', 'principles (or ideas) waiting in the mind to be discovered. This is suggested by\\n', 'Locke’s reply that he does not understand what Stillingfleet could mean when he\\n', 'puts forward the view that “from the consideration of ourselves, and what we find in\\n', 'our own constitutions, the certainty is placed in good and sound reason. . . .

I suggest that Locke’s response here has to do with how we are able\\n', 'to come to knowledge of the existence of God, not just by the consideration of an\\n', 'idea, but also by the mind’s ability to use the faculty of reason to construct a\\n', 'demonstrative proof. So, Locke is not necessarily denying that we can have propos-\\n', 'itional knowledge on the basis of perceiving individual ideas. He is only denying that\\n', 'an individual idea (without either propositions or the use of reason) can result in a\\n', 'successful demonstration. Therefore, we need not read the foregoing statements to\\n', 'Stillingfleet as precluding the interpretation of the intuitive knowledge of an idea (or\\n', 'of ourselves) that I have put forward.\\n', '\\n', 'Considering what we find in the Essay, that is, owing to (1) the claim that we\\n', 'know the identity of individual ideas; (2) the claim that general identity statements\\n', '57 Note that this idea would be a full-fledged idea of the self, which results from reflecting on the pre-reflective experience of an I (or self-consciousness) in any perception of an idea.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'are trivial while knowledge of the identity of an idea is foundational; (3) the\\n', 'evidence that consciousness is self-consciousness and of the particular relation\\n', 'between consciousness and perception that allows textual and philosophical con-\\n', 'sistency to Locke’s model of the mind; (4) the claim that we have an idea of\\n', 'existence “joined” or “annexed” to every other idea; (5) the evidence that there\\n', 'need not be an additional mental act to know an agreement intuitively; and (6) the\\n', 'claim that ideas are “metaphysically true,” namely “really to be such as they exist”\\n', 'in the mind, something along the lines of what I have argued might be the best we\\n', 'can do for Locke. The sheer number of passages affirming something like the\\n', 'interpretation I have put forward should, at the very least, tip the balance in its\\n', 'favor. Therefore, we should see the intuitive knowledge of our own ideas, which\\n', 'grounds the possibility of attaining any knowledge at all, as well as the knowledge of\\n', 'our own existence, as forms of propositional knowledge conveyed in the perception\\n', 'of an individual idea.

I argued that perceptions of ideas are\\n', 'complex propositional states that convey knowledge. In perceiving any idea, I know\\n', 'two propositions resulting from agreeing elements therein. Because in the percep-\\n', 'tion of any idea there is included an idea of existence and my consciousness of\\n', 'myself as perceiving both ideas, I know tacitly or implicitly that the idea is as I am\\n', 'perceiving it to be and that I exist. Now that I have explained the complexity of our\\n', 'mental states and how as the result of that complexity we have knowledge of our\\n', 'own ideas and our own existence, in parts II and III I will extend that analysis to an\\n', 'explanation of how (in part II), and the extent to which (in part III), for Locke, we\\n', 'can claim to have knowledge of particular things existing external to us.

Just as\\n', 'we saw in the previous cases, the agreement perceived in having knowledge of\\n', 'something external to me will also make sense of the proposition Locke uses to\\n', 'express it.

But, also, knowledge comes in\\n', 'three “degrees” of evidence, or certainty: intuitive knowledge, demonstrative know-\\n', 'ledge, and sensitive knowledge. As far as intuitive and demonstrative knowledge go,\\n', 'Locke is right in line with other seventeenth-century figures, most notably Descartes.\\n', '\\n', 'But when it comes to sensitive knowledge—our knowledge of particular external\\n', 'world objects—he holds a very peculiar view.

To see how\\n', 'Locke can hold such a view, let us start with a brief description of what Locke calls\\n', '“sensitive” knowledge of “the existence of particular finite beings without us”\\n', '(IV.ii.14) and then consider some of the well-known questions arising from his\\n', 'account. What follows here and in part III will provide answers to these questions,\\n', 'as well as explain the role of consciousness and the complexity of our mental states in\\n', 'answering them.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'In the following passages, we find Locke’s distinctions between the three degrees of\\n', 'certainty of knowledge.58 First, Locke provides a general statement of the kind of\\n', 'difference we see in the three degrees of knowledge:\\n', 'All our Knowledge consisting, as I have said in the view the Mind has of its own Ideas, which is\\n', 'the utmost Light and greatest Certainty, we with our Faculties, and in our way of Knowledge\\n', 'are capable of, it may not be amiss, to consider a little the degrees of its Evidence. The different clearness of our Knowledge seems to me to lie in the different way of Perception, the Mind has\\n', 'of the Agreement, or Disagreement of any of its Ideas.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ii.1)\\n', 'Then he tells us that the way of perceiving in intuitive knowledge provides the highest\\n', 'degree of certainty:\\n', 'For if we reflect on our own ways of Thinking, we shall find, that sometimes the Mind perceives\\n', 'the Agreement or Disagreement of two Ideas immediately by themselves, without the inter-\\n', 'vention of any other: And this, I think, we may call intuitive Knowledge.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ii.1)\\n', 'Next, the way of perceiving in demonstrative knowledge has less certainty:\\n', 'The next degree of Knowledge is, where the Mind perceives the Agreement or Disagreement of\\n', 'any of its Ideas, but not immediately. . . . In this Case, then, when the Mind cannot so bring its\\n', 'Ideas together, as by their immediate Comparison, and as it were Juxta-position, or application\\n', 'to one another, to perceive their Agreement or Disagreement, it is fain, by the Intervention of\\n', 'other Ideas (one or more, as it happens) to discover the Agreement or Disagreement, which it\\n', 'searches; and this is that which we call Reasoning.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ii.2)\\n', 'This Knowledge by intervening Proofs, though it be certain, yet the evidence of it is not\\n', 'altogether so clear and bright, nor the assent so ready, as in intuitive Knowledge.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ii.4)\\n', 'And finally, sensitive knowledge has the lowest degree of certainty:\\n', 'These two, (viz.) Intuition and Demonstration, are the degrees of our Knowledge; whatever\\n', 'comes short of one of these, with what assurance soever embraced, is by Faith, or Opinion, but\\n', 'not Knowledge, at least in all general Truths. There is, indeed, another Perception of the Mind,\\n', 'employ’d about the particular existence of finite Beings without us; which going beyond bare\\n', 'probability, and yet not reaching perfectly to either of the foregoing degrees of certainty, passes under the name of Knowledge.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ii.14)\\n', 'Intuitive knowledge is most certain, demonstrative knowledge is a little less certain,\\n', 'and sensitive knowledge (of the truth of the existence of particular things external to\\n', '58 I should note that this is not entirely uncontroversial. Rickless (forthcoming) argues that demonstrative knowledge is not less certain than intuitive knowledge, although it lacks, as Locke says, “that evident lustre” and “perfect Clearness and Distinctness” (IV.ii.6) that comes with intuitive knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'Locke, however, does seem to say fairly explicitly that demonstrative knowledge is a different degree of certainty when he “allow[s] these three degrees of Knowledge, viz. Intuitive, Demonstrative, and Sensitive: In each of which, there are different degrees and ways of Evidence and Certainty” (IV.ii.14). Also, I will address the consistency of both holding that demonstrative knowledge is less certain than intuitive knowledge and Locke’s claims about the difference between them in lustre, clearness, and distinctness in part III.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'us) is even less certain than that. Which degree of certainty is reached seems to\\n', 'depend on the way the agreement is perceived. Immediately known agreements, non-\\n', 'inferential knowledge, have the highest degree of certainty, while the need for\\n', 'intervening ideas, resulting in inferential knowledge, lessens the certainty.\\n', '\\n', 'What about sensitive knowledge? Is it inferential, or is it non-inferential? Answering\\n', 'this question merely leads to a host of others. On the one hand, if it is inferential, then\\n', 'how is it any different from demonstrative knowledge? Perhaps the reason is that it\\n', 'has to do with particular existences as opposed to general truths. Quite naturally, we\\n', 'would think there to be an inference from an idea to the existence of an external\\n', 'object. But then, also quite naturally, we might ask why it qualifies as anything more\\n', 'than probable judgment. Support for this line of reasoning, one might continue, is\\n', 'found in IV.xi.4–7, where Locke provides a series of probabilistic arguments in\\n', 'defense of sensitive knowledge. Thinking these arguments are meant as sole justifi-\\n', 'cation for sensitive knowledge, however, leaves us again wondering why Locke calls it\\n', 'knowledge. Why would he open the door to a third degree of knowledge by distin-\\n', 'guishing it from demonstrative knowledge of general truths? On the other hand, if\\n', 'sensitive knowledge is non-inferential, then how is it different from intuitive know-\\n', 'ledge, and how can it be less certain than demonstrative knowledge?\\n', '\\n', 'I suggest that these questions, roughly, boil down to the following three: First, how\\n', 'can Locke think that we have knowledge of things external to the mind when ideas\\n', 'serve as the immediate objects of perception? Second, given that Locke thinks\\n', 'sensitive knowledge counts as a (less certain) form of knowledge, why would he\\n', 'offer a series of probabilistic arguments in defense of it? Third, how should we see\\n', 'sensitive knowledge as something different from intuitive and demonstrative know-\\n', 'ledge given that we are limited to just two ways of perceiving agreements: either non-\\n', 'inferentially or inferentially? I see the first two questions, and relatedly the third, as\\n', 'motivated primarily by skeptical concerns. Given that ideas are the objects of percep-\\n', 'tion, how can Locke think we have knowledge of things external to us? Another way to\\n', 'pose this question is to ask, what does Locke think we actually know in an instance of\\n', 'sensitive knowledge, and how do we know it? Later in part III of this chapter, I will\\n', 'offer an interpretation of sensitive knowledge that answers these skeptical concerns.\\n', '\\n', 'Before we move on to Locke’s treatment of the skeptical challenge, though, it is\\n', 'important, first, to address a different puzzle. For seeing how sensitive knowledge\\n', 'can fall under the category of knowledge at all requires an understanding of how it\\n', 'satisfies the general definition of knowledge. What is the agreement perceived in an\\n', 'instance of sensitive knowledge such that, given Locke’s representationalism, it makes\\n', 'sense to say we have sufficient contact with things outside us to make any claims about\\n', 'their actual existence? Here in part II, I provide an answer to this question.\\n', '\\n', 'Locke understands knowledge as consisting in the perception of an agreement or\\n', 'disagreement of ideas (IV.i.2). From this, he says, “it follows . . . That [w]e can have\\n', 'Knowledge no farther than we have Ideas” (IV.iii.1). But then he describes the\\n', 'agreement in sensitive knowledge, a species of the knowledge of real existence, as\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '“that of actual real Existence agreeing to any Idea” (IV.i.7).59 These two descriptions\\n', 'seem to conflict, and no interpretive suggestion for how to resolve the tension has\\n', 'carried the day. How can knowledge extend no farther than our ideas (be the\\n', 'perception of an agreement of ideas) and yet what we know is expressed by the\\n', 'proposition: “actual real Existence agreeing to any Idea”?\\n', '\\n', 'A spate of interpretations has come forward in recent years, each emphasizing\\n', 'various aspects of Locke’s account. My interpretation is in agreement with many of\\n', 'these aspects. For example, like Mattern (1978) and Soles (1985), I emphasize the\\n', 'propositional nature of knowledge. But unlike them, I do not argue that the true\\n', 'proposition known corresponds to an external existent. Rather my interpretation is\\n', 'fully consistent with Locke’s general (fully ideational) definition of knowledge.60 Like\\n', 'Ayers (1991) and Bolton (2004a), I give due weight to the contribution of Locke’s\\n', 'semantic externalism. Unlike them, I argue that the proposition known in an instance\\n', 'of sensitive knowledge includes also internalist epistemic justification. Like Allen\\n', '(2013) and Nagel (forthcoming), I argue for the importance of the subjective experi-\\n', 'ence of sensing in an instance of sensitive knowledge. Unlike both, I argue that the\\n', 'proposition known does not include a reflective idea of sensation. And like Owen\\n', '(2008), Allen (2013), and Weinberg (2013), I argue that sensitive knowledge is non-\\n', 'inferential.61 But my account, unlike all these others (and some I have not men-\\n', 'tioned),62 fully explains the contribution of both the internalist and externalist aspects,\\n', 'and it does so without textual conflict and without tempting incoherence with other of\\n', 'Locke’s views. Because these other interpretations and objections to them are readily\\n', 'available and it would take up far too much space to rehearse them all, I will not\\n', 'reiterate them here.63 Rather, when appropriate, I will simply note reasons for\\n', '59 Locke provides this definition as a general one to cover all three cases of the knowledge of real existence: knowledge of my own existence, knowledge of the existence of God, and knowledge of the existence of particular finite beings (IV.i.7, IV.iii.21). In part I, I argued that the complexity of the perception of an idea provides us with the agreement in knowing that I exist. Consistent with the analysis in part I, the complexity of the appropriate mental state will also provide the elements constitutive of the agreement in the case of sensitive knowledge. Knowing that God exists is different and I will not go into it, nor need I, since it is a derivative case of demonstrative knowledge that begins with the knowledge of my own existence as a thinking being.\\n', '\\n', '60 Hill (2006), also emphasizing the propositional nature of knowledge, includes a good summary and criticism of both Mattern and Soles.\\n', '\\n', '61 Only Weinberg (2013) provides a comprehensive argument that sensitive knowledge is non-\\n', 'inferential.\\n', '\\n', '62 These would include Newman (2004, 2007) and Rickless (2008). But both argue that sensitive\\n', 'knowledge is not really a case of genuine knowledge.\\n', '\\n', '63 For example, Gibson (1960: 166), Aaron (1971: 240), Woolhouse (1994: 154, 168), and Jolley (1999: 187) see no solution to the apparent inconsistency between the definition of knowledge as the perception of an agreement of ideas and Locke’s IV.i.7 expression of our knowledge of real existence (in this case sensitive knowledge) as “actual real Existence agreeing to an Idea.” Yolton (1984) and Lennon (2004) attempt to resolve the tension by interpreting Locke as having a direct theory of perception. But there is significant textual evidence against such an interpretation. See, for example, IV.xxi.4 and IV.iii.1.

Consistent with the previous analysis in part I of how\\n', 'we know other particular things (individual ideas and our own existence), the same\\n', 'trio of constituents comprising the complexity of the perception of an idea forms the\\n', 'agreement perceived in an instance of sensitive knowledge. Therefore, as in those\\n', 'other two cases, there is no conflict with Locke’s general definition of knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'I will then, in section 3.II.5, explain why my account is consistent with Locke’s\\n', 'statements to Stillingfleet about the nature of the agreement perceived in having\\n', 'sensitive knowledge.\\n', '\\n', '3.II.1 Locke’s Commitments—The Elements\\n', 'of Sensitive Knowledge\\n', 'A survey of the Essay reveals that Locke’s account of perceiving the agreement in\\n', 'sensitive knowledge includes five fundamental elements:\\n', '1. Knowledge in general is defined as “the perception of the connexion and\\n', 'agreement, or disagreement and repugnancy of any of our Ideas” (IV.i.2).\\n', '\\n', '2. Sensitive knowledge, a species of the knowledge of real existence, is defined as\\n', '“that of actual real Existence agreeing to an Idea” (IV.i.7).\\n', '\\n', 'strictly speaking, there is no perception of an agreement of ideas. Soles (1985) also finds a solution in Locke’s propositional account of knowledge by arguing that inferences to unobservable entities are not precluded by Locke’s empiricist principle that all knowledge originates in ideas of sensation and reflection.\\n', '\\n', 'But, arguably, both of these views stray from Locke’s definition of knowledge as the perception of an agreement or disagreement of ideas. Newman (2004, 2007) tries to reconcile the tension by having sensitive knowledge include both the perception of an agreement of ideas and a probable judgment between an idea and something external to us. Rickless (2008) and Allen (2013) lodge well-reasoned objections to Newman’s view. Rickless (2008) attempts reconciliation by arguing that the perception of some true propositions really only achieves the highest degree of probability, or what he calls “assurance.” Owen (1999), Allen (2013), Weinberg (2013), and Nagel (forthcoming) offer objections to Rickless (2008), and all but Weinberg offer their own interpretations of the agreement perceived constituting knowledge consistent with the definition of knowledge. (I am providing my interpretation in this part of chapter three.) Rickless (forthcoming) tries to defend his view against objections by Allen, Nagel, and Owen, (and Weinberg\\n', 'indirectly). Reiterating arguments by Owen, Allen, Weinberg, and Nagel, most recently Wilson (2014: 10) sums it up by saying “there are simply too many passages in which Locke refers to sensitive knowledge as knowledge while not giving any indication that he is only honorifically referring to it as such.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '3.

An internalist justificatory element whereby we are aware of sensory ideas as\\n', 'originating in sensation (IV.ii.14), rather than, say, in memory.\\n', '\\n', 'Although one might disagree that a coherent account of an instance of sensitive\\n', 'knowledge need include all five elements, in order to leave any of them out, one\\n', 'must somehow explain away what we find in the text. I think it is fair to say that Locke\\n', 'thinks each of these five elements has some sort of role to play in an instance of\\n', 'sensitive knowledge.64 Each is mentioned and seemingly relied on in the various\\n', 'places where Locke discusses how we might have sufficient contact with an external\\n', 'world to claim some sort of knowledge of it. And even if some interpretations admit all\\n', 'five elements, significant disagreement exists over what role each part actually plays.\\n', '\\n', 'I start with the assumption that Locke means what he says and then see how we can\\n', 'come up with an interpretation that avoids any apparent tensions or inconsistencies.\\n', '\\n', 'Because I think Locke means all five elements to play a role in an instance of\\n', 'sensitive knowledge and because I think other interpretations are flawed in one way or\\n', 'another, I am suggesting we take a new look. I argue that all five elements can be\\n', 'brought together into a reasonable and coherent picture of the agreement perceived in\\n', 'an instance of sensitive knowledge as Locke sees it—not probable judgment. One\\n', 'reason is that Locke, not unsurprisingly, focuses on the relation sensory ideas in fact\\n', 'have not only to external causes, but also, and perhaps equally importantly, to our\\n', 'subjective internal experience in having ideas of external objects. I will argue that\\n', 'elements (1)–(5) above can be accounted for by looking to what is presented to us in\\n', 'consciousness and what is implied by what is presented to us as the result of perceiving\\n', 'an occurrent idea of an external object. Consistent with how we know our own ideas\\n', 'and our own existence, I argue that this other form of knowledge—what Locke calls\\n', 'our knowledge of the existence of “particular finite beings”—is due to the complex\\n', 'nature of our perceptual states. Because of the complexity of perceptions of ideas and\\n', 'because of Locke’s one-act view of knowledge, we can know an agreement expressed\\n', 'by the proposition “actual real Existence agreeing to an Idea” just in virtue of\\n', 'having that complex mental state. Furthermore, my interpretation is consistent with\\n', 'Locke’s famous statement of the agreement when pressed by Stillingfleet in their\\n', '64 Ayers (1991, I: 159) and Bolton (2004a: 316–19) focus on the externalist justificatory condition by maintaining somewhat similarly, although by different argumentation, that any knowledge we have of the real existence of external objects is better achieved by Locke’s account of how ideas successfully represent their causes. Thus, I think they see the internalist justificatory element as having no real role to play. Allen’s (2013: 253–4) remarks sharply distinguishing “real knowledge” from “sensitive knowledge” lead me to think he may deny any role to the externalist justificatory element.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'correspondence.65 My strategy is to lay out the account we find in the Essay before\\n', 'showing its consistency with his reply to Stillingfleet.

By the end of section II.4, all of\\n', 'Locke’s commitments will be accounted for, the proposition known in an instance of\\n', 'sensitive knowledge will be fully constructed, and the tension between sensitive\\n', 'knowledge and the general definition of knowledge will be resolved.\\n', '\\n', 'Let us begin with the definition of knowledge as the perception of an agreement of\\n', 'ideas. What we are looking for is the ideas that form the basis of the agreement in an\\n', 'instance of sensitive knowledge. Locke’s IV.ii.14 account of what happens in an instance\\n', 'of sensitive knowledge is a natural place to start. He begins with the statement that along\\n', 'with intuitive and demonstrative knowledge “There is, indeed, another Perception of the\\n', 'Mind, employ’d about the particular existence of finite beings without us.” Immediately\\n', 'thereafter, he says, “There can be nothing more certain than, that the Idea we receive\\n', 'from an external Object is in our Minds.” I take this to be a clear statement when we\\n', 'have an idea of an object we know that we do: We have intuitive knowledge of the idea.\\n', '\\n', 'So having sensitive knowledge begins with the intuitive knowledge that there is in my\\n', 'mind an idea of an object: I have an immediate intuitive certainty that the intrinsic\\n', 'apparent features of the idea are in my mind.\\n', '\\n', 'But remember that Locke also thinks that all ideas are accompanied by a simple\\n', 'idea of existence (II.vii.7). Every perception of an idea is a complex mental state that\\n', 'includes, at the very least, the idea perceived, an idea of existence, and consciousness.\\n', '\\n', 'So, just as knowing an idea and knowing my own existence is grounded in this trio of\\n', 'constituents, knowing the existence of an object is also grounded in this trio of\\n', '65 Locke 1823, IV: 360. (All subsequent references to this work will be cited in the text by the\\n', 'abbreviated title Works, volume number: page number.) But I do not agree with the interpretations of the agreement as extracted from that passage offered by Newman (2004, 2007), Rickless (2008), Allen (2013), and Nagel (forthcoming).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'constituents. As Locke says about the accompanying simple idea of existence,\\n', '“Existence and Unity, are two other Ideas, that are suggested to the Understanding,\\n', 'by every Object without and every Idea within. When Ideas are in our Minds, we\\n', 'consider them as being actually there, as well as we consider things to be actually\\n', 'without us; which is that they exist, or have Existence” (II.vii.7). As I have already\\n', 'argued, having any idea together with an idea of existence is the state of affairs\\n', 'expressed in the proposition that the idea is there—that it exists in my mind.\\n', '\\n', 'Whenever I have an idea in my mind, the accompanying idea of existence contributes\\n', 'to my knowing that there exists something in my mind. But, as is clear from the\\n', 'preceding passage, Locke seems to think that, at least in some cases, I also take my\\n', 'idea to be as of something existing outside my mind. We see Locke say the same sort\\n', 'of thing when talking about the signification of names in III.iv.2: “The Names of\\n', 'simple Ideas and Substances, with the abstract Ideas in the Mind, which they\\n', 'immediately signify, intimate also some real Existence, from which was derived\\n', 'their original pattern.” For example, when I am thinking about a cat, I consider\\n', 'myself as having an idea of cat. Locke, though, seems to think that at the same time\\n', 'I take my idea to be as of a cat existing outside or independently of my mind. Donald\\n', 'Ainslie (2013: 99) puts it nicely here: “We are aware of objects by means of ideas that\\n', 'present them to us from our particular perspective, in the same way we are aware of\\n', 'things outside our visual field when we look at images of them in a mirror.” I take the\\n', 'idea of the cat in my mind to be an idea as of a cat existing outside my mind. Indeed,\\n', 'I suggest we do the same thing when we have an idea of a particular piece of gold.\\n', '\\n', 'That is, when I have an idea of a piece of gold, I experience myself as having an idea\\n', 'of gold in my mind, but at the same time I also experience myself as having an idea as\\n', 'of an independently existing piece of gold.\\n', '\\n', 'We see the same sort of language describing how we experience our ideas in other\\n', 'places in the Essay. In talking about ideas of substances in III.v.3, Locke says those\\n', 'ideas “carry with them the Supposition of some real Being, from which they are\\n', 'taken, and to which they are conformable” (my emphasis in bold). Locke’s chapters\\n', 'on “real” and “adequate” ideas (II.xxx–xxxii), which are an account of how ideas\\n', 'succeed in representing things to us, have similar language. In II.xxxi.1, Locke states\\n', 'that whenever we have ideas, we also suppose those ideas to be “taken from” their\\n', '“archetypes” or causes: “Of our real Ideas some are Adequate, and some are Inad-\\n', 'equate. Those I call Adequate, which perfectly represent those Archetypes, which the\\n', 'Mind supposes them taken from; which it intends them to stand for, and to which it\\n', 'refers them” (II.xxxi.1, my emphasis in bold). Perceiving an idea as of something\\n', 'external to me includes supposing the existence of whatever the idea “stands for” or is\\n', '“referred to”—its archetype or cause.66 And it is not only “real” ideas that come with\\n', 'this suggestion that they are ideas of external things. In distinguishing “real” from\\n', '66 See also Ayers (1991, I: 62–3) and Bolton (2004a: 312).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', '“fantastical” ideas, Locke says of the latter that they “have no Foundation in Nature,\\n', 'nor have any Conformity with that reality of Being, to which they are tacitly referr’d,\\n', 'as to their Archetypes” (II.xxx.1, my emphasis in bold). So, also, we “tacitly refer” or\\n', '“suppose” our fictional ideas to represent real things in Nature, even though we may\\n', 'come to find out that they really do not. It seems to be the case, for Locke, that\\n', 'whenever I have an idea, say of a particular object, I consider, or suppose, it to be of\\n', 'something external to me. I experience it as of something external to me, as of\\n', 'something outside my mind. Consistent with how Locke describes it in II.vii.7,\\n', 'I suggest that having an idea of existence “suggested to the Understanding” with\\n', 'an idea of an object is what this “taking,” “considering,” “supposing,” or as I have\\n', 'called it, “experiencing,” consists in. Thus, ideas of objects (say, of particular finite\\n', 'beings) just are experienced as ideas of real things—as of things having a real\\n', 'existence outside of me.\\n', '\\n', 'Having these two ideas together in my mind (an idea of an object and an idea of\\n', 'existence) as a part of a more complex mental state gives me the experience or, as\\n', 'Locke says in II.vii.7, the suggestion, that what I am perceiving exists; I experience the\\n', 'idea as of an external object—as of something existing outside of my mind. That these\\n', 'two ideas and the experience of them together in the mind form the foundation of the\\n', 'agreement perceived in an instance of sensitive knowledge is confirmed by Locke in\\n', 'his defense of it to Stillingfleet: “[E]xistence is affirmed of something, some being:\\n', 'and I have as clear an idea of existence and something, the two things joined in that\\n', 'proposition, as I have of them in this proposition, ‘something exists in the world,\\n', 'whereof I have an idea’” (Works IV: 357–8). As we will see, more needs to be added\\n', 'to the explanation before we can claim to have sensitive knowledge as a part of this\\n', 'complex mental state. But we do have the basis—the two ideas—for the agreement\\n', 'expressed by the proposition Locke uses in IV.i.7: We have an idea of existence\\n', 'agreeing to an idea of an object.67\\n', 'At this point, two crucial distinctions must be made and kept in mind. First,\\n', 'although whenever we perceive an idea of an object, we experience that idea as of\\n', 'something existing outside the mind, that supposition holds up only with respect to\\n', 'real and adequate ideas of sensation. “Real” and “adequate” ideas, for Locke, are\\n', 'technical terms describing both a causal and a representational relation between some\\n', 'real existence and my idea. In Locke’s theory of representation, real and adequate\\n', 'ideas actually do correspond to the real existence of their causes.68 The supposition,\\n', 'however, does not hold up with respect to “fantastical or Chimerical” ideas. We will\\n', 'see why in just a moment. Second, perceiving an idea that in fact does correspond to\\n', '67 Here I agree with Allen (2013: 256) that the idea of existence is “itself insufficient” (my emphasis) to account for the reality and the actuality of the existence of the object. But I disagree that it does not play any role at all.\\n', '\\n', '68 Bolton (2004a: 311ff) argues that simple ideas perform their “representational function” by meeting two semantic conditions working in tandem: a causal correspondence condition and a marking condition, which involves a supposition of a really existing external thing.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'something existing external to me does not also mean that the external thing has either\\n', 'present, or actual, outer existence. Present, or actual, existence would imply something\\n', 'more: that there is something outside or external to me at this moment causing my\\n', 'idea. Consider these two distinctions in this example: If I close my eyes and think\\n', 'about a cat, I am not presently or actually sensing it. Nevertheless, when I think about\\n', 'a cat, I consider or suppose (or experience) the idea to be of a real cat existing at some\\n', 'place or some time. Maybe it is an idea of a chimerical or fictional cat, say, one with a\\n', 'horn in the front of its head, in which case my supposition turns out false. Or maybe\\n', 'the cat I am thinking of is the black one named “Cartman” that I left at home this\\n', 'morning, a really existing cat, one with which I am in some sort of causal relation. In\\n', 'this case, my supposition turns out to be true. In neither case, though, for Locke, am\\n', 'I justified in claiming that the cat I am thinking of is presently, or actually, external to\\n', 'me in this moment causing my idea. In order to make these additional claims, the\\n', 'other elements of an instance of sensitive knowledge must be added in.\\n', '\\n', 'Importantly, though, for now, we have the foundation for the agreement perceived\\n', '(the true proposition known) in an instance of sensitive knowledge: Owing to the\\n', 'idea of an object and an idea of existence we have in the mind an idea as of an existing\\n', '(outer) object. That is, owing to the complexity of the mental state in perceiving an\\n', 'idea of an object, we have an experience of an idea as of an existing object. I suggest\\n', 'that this is what Locke means when he begins the IV.ii.14 analysis of sensitive\\n', 'knowledge with the claim that we can be certain that we have in the mind an idea\\n', 'of an external object—not just an idea of an object, but of an external object. But\\n', 'notice that Locke makes this claim prior to questioning whether there really is an\\n', 'external object causing the idea. Thus, he must be thinking, and quite naturally so,\\n', 'that merely having an idea of an external object in the mind is not sufficient for\\n', 'sensitive knowledge. More justification is needed. Also, importantly, we have shown\\n', 'that sensitive knowledge satisfies the definition of knowledge as the perception of\\n', 'ideational agreement, understood propositionally, although we have yet to include all\\n', 'of the state of affairs constituting that knowledge and expressed in the complete\\n', 'proposition. We can now, as it were, build the state of affairs and thus the proposition\\n', 'from the bottom up by including the other elements on our list of Locke’s commit-\\n', 'ments until we have the complete state of affairs expressed in the proposition he uses\\n', 'in IV.i.7 to describe what we know when we have sensitive knowledge. Thus, we will\\n', 'see how each of the other of Locke’s commitments (the externalist justificatory\\n', 'element, the internalist justificatory element, and the present affectation of the\\n', 'senses) plays a role in having sensitive knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'Another way to see it is to say that we have now partially satisfied the agreement\\n', 'described in an instance of sensitive knowledge: “actual real Existence agreeing to an\\n', 'Idea” (IV.i.7). As we have seen, included along with an idea of an object is an idea of\\n', 'existence, giving me the experience of my idea as of an external object. But other\\n', 'conditions must be met in order to be able to say whether that object really exists or\\n', 'whether it actually/presently exists, namely those further features we see described in\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'the IV.i.7 definition. In order to have sensitive knowledge those additional elements\\n', 'must be given as a part of the complex mental state, to which I will return shortly. For\\n', 'now, simply note how Locke’s account of sensitive knowledge grows out of his\\n', 'account of how we know our own ideas. Because perceptual states are complex, we\\n', 'can have various forms of knowledge depending on the constituents of the mental\\n', 'state. Every perceptual state includes the original idea perceived, an idea of existence,\\n', 'and consciousness. No matter what the original idea perceived is, having these three\\n', 'constituents in the mind results in intuitive knowledge of the idea and of my\\n', 'existence. We now see that the same three constituents (as long as other conditions\\n', 'are also met) lead to an instance of sensitive knowledge. Let us move now to those\\n', 'other conditions justifying an instance of sensitive knowledge.\\n', '\\n', '3.II.3 From an Idea of an Object to the Real Existence\\n', 'of the Object\\n', 'As in the other two cases of knowing a particular thing (individual ideas and ourselves),\\n', 'we are explaining a state of affairs that is also the state of the proposition known. In an\\n', 'instance of sensitive knowledge of a particular external object that state of affairs begins\\n', 'with having an idea of an object and taking that object to be as of something external to\\n', 'me, which is expressed in the proposition that existence agrees to any idea. (Note that\\n', 'this proposition is embedded in the more complex one Locke is committed to in his\\n', 'IV.i.7 definition of the agreement known: “that of actual real Existence agreeing to any\\n', 'Idea.”) But there is nothing in the state of affairs expressed in the truncated proposition\\n', 'at this point precluding that the idea has no basis in a reality existing outside of us, even\\n', 'though we might experience it that way. So, let us consider, first, how we get from the\\n', 'perception of an idea of an object considered as external to us to the real existence of the\\n', 'object, one step farther to filling out the agreement perceived and the proposition\\n', 'known in having sensitive knowledge. I suggest that incorporating Locke’s commitment\\n', 'to an externalist justificatory element in having knowledge permits us to take that step.\\n', '\\n', 'For some ideas, the supposition of independent reality turns out to be true.\\n', '\\n', 'One place where Locke seems to treat the difference between a mere agreement of\\n', 'ideas and an agreement of ideas that has a basis in an external reality is in his IV.iv,\\n', 'discussion of the “Reality of Knowledge.” When it comes to having knowledge of\\n', 'general truths, Locke’s incorporation of an externalist justificatory element, that\\n', '“real” and “adequate” ideas are in a guaranteed conformity with their causes, gets\\n', 'us from knowledge simply as the perception of an agreement of ideas, to something\\n', 'more, what Locke calls “real Knowledge.” Although Locke’s specific aim in this\\n', 'chapter is not to justify our knowledge of the existence of a particular thing, namely\\n', 'sensitive knowledge, I take it to have some relevance, since having real knowledge is\\n', 'dependent on the relation individual ideas expressed in propositions bear to real\\n', 'things existing external to us.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Locke begins the chapter Of the Reality of our Knowledge with this:\\n', 'I Doubt not but my Reader, by this time, may be apt to think, that I have been all this while\\n', 'only building a Castle in the Air; and be ready to say to me, To what purpose all this stir?\\n', '\\n', 'Knowledge, say you, is only the perception of the agreement or disagreement of our own Ideas:\\n', 'but who knows what those Ideas may be?

If it be true, that all Knowledge lies only in the perception of the agreement or disagreement of our own Ideas, the Visions of an Enthusiast, and the\\n', 'Reasonings of a sober Man, will be equally certain.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.iv.1)\\n', 'In response to the challenge that the confinement to our own ideas precludes any\\n', 'meaningful sense in which we can claim to know anything outside of us, Locke says:\\n', 'To which I answer, That if our Knowledge of our Ideas terminate in them, and reach no\\n', 'farther, where there is something farther intended, our most serious Thoughts will be of little\\n', 'more use, than the Reveries of a crazy Brain; and the Truths built thereon of no more weight,\\n', 'than the Discourses of a Man, who sees Things clearly in a Dream, and with great assurance\\n', 'utters them.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.iv.2)\\n', 'Locke’s view appears to be that unless we have some reason to think that our ideas\\n', 'really do reach out to “something farther intended,” our claims to know anything\\n', 'about a real world are based on nothing more than fictions.

But\\n', 'note that Locke is not saying that we have some sort of direct knowledge of real\\n', 'things themselves. Rather, we have a knowledge of our own ideas that also takes us to\\n', 'whatever is intended or represented by those ideas. Why would Locke think that our\\n', 'ideas reach out to real things?\\n', '\\n', 'The difference between the “Visions of an Enthusiast” and the “Reasonings of a\\n', 'sober man” is that the latter’s ideas are in “conformity” with real things. Two sorts of\\n', 'ideas, according to Locke, can be said to conform to the reality of things:\\n', '’Tis evident, the Mind knows not Things immediately, but only by the intervention of the Ideas\\n', 'it has of them. Our Knowledge therefore is real, only so far as there is a conformity between our\\n', 'Ideas and the reality of Things. But what shall here be the Criterion? How shall the Mind, when\\n', 'it perceives nothing but its own Ideas, know that they agree with Things themselves? This,\\n', 'though it seems not to want difficulty, yet, I think there be two sorts of Ideas, that, we may be\\n', 'assured, agree with Things.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.iv.3)\\n', 'The two kinds of ideas that conform to real things are simple ideas and complex ideas\\n', 'not of substances: first, simple ideas, because “the Mind can by no means make\\n', '[simple ideas] to it self ” (IV.iv.4) and, second, complex ideas except those of\\n', 'substances, because “that which is designed to represent any thing but it self, can\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'never be capable of a wrong representation, nor mislead us from the true apprehen-\\n', 'sion of any thing, by its dislikeness to it” (IV.iv.5).69 Thus, our ideas conform to real\\n', 'things either if those ideas are the result of things operating on the mind rather than\\n', 'the product of the mind itself, or if they are a product of the mind, then they must not\\n', 'intend to represent or be a copy of something other than themselves. Notice, and this\\n', 'is important, that when our ideas can be said to conform to real things, it is because\\n', 'they satisfy certain factual conditions. Fulfilling conditions for the “true apprehen-\\n', 'sion” of a real thing concerns our relation to the cause of the idea and the complete-\\n', 'ness of the representation.\\n', '\\n', 'Locke’s descriptions of simple ideas and complex ideas of modes and relations as\\n', '“real” (II.xxx) and “adequate” (II.xxxi) include criteria distinctly similar to the\\n', 'reasons why they are candidates for agreements leading to “real knowledge.” In\\n', 'II.xxx.2, he claims that simple ideas have “all that is requisite to make them real,\\n', 'and not fictions at Pleasure. For in simple Ideas, . . . the Mind is wholly confined to the\\n', 'Operations of things upon it; and can make to it self no simple Idea, more than what\\n', 'it has received.” And in II.xxxi.1, Locke describes adequate ideas as those “which\\n', 'perfectly represent” those things the mind supposes them taken from. A simple idea\\n', '“cannot but be adequate, since it ought only to answer that power” that produced it\\n', '(II.xxxi.2). Alternatively, fictional ideas, for Locke, are complex ideas constructed by\\n', 'us that have no conformity “with that reality of Being, to which they are tacitly\\n', 'referr’d” (II.iii.1): a unicorn for example, or perhaps a similarly horned cat.70\\n', 'From the similarity of the language in his description of ideas that conform to real\\n', 'things and in his definitions of real and adequate ideas, it is reasonable to interpret\\n', 'Locke as thinking that whether or not our ideas “reach out” to something really\\n', 'existing outside us has to do with perceiving real and adequate ideas of sensation,\\n', 'namely those ideas to which we are passive and which we take to represent only the\\n', 'powers that produce them in us. Therefore, it is reasonable to think that having\\n', 'knowledge of the existence of particular external objects also requires that we have\\n', 'some justification that the ideas making up the agreement are real and adequate.\\n', '\\n', 'Note that meeting these criteria does not preclude the possibility that the real and\\n', '69 Complex ideas of substances cannot be known to conform to real things, “because we, knowing not\\n', 'what real Constitution it is of Substances, whereon our simple Ideas depend, and which really is the cause of the strict union of some of them one with another, and the exclusion of others; there are very few of them that we can be sure are, or are not inconsistent in Nature, any farther than Experience and sensible Observation reaches. . . . Which (as has been already shewed) will not be found to reach very far: But so far as it does, it will still be real Knowledge” (IV.iv.12). Where this has been already shown is in IV.iii.14. There, Locke states that we know only two necessary co-existences: “Figure necessarily supposes extension,” and\\n', '“receiving or communicating Motion by impulse, supposes Solidity.” As we will see, this does not preclude that the simple sensory ideas composing our complex ideas of substances “reach out” to real things.\\n', '\\n', '70 Because complex ideas of modes and relations, says Locke, have “no other reality than what they have in the Minds of Men” (II.xxx.4), all that is required to make them real is that their composition does not contain an inconsistency. Ideas of modes and relations are necessarily adequate, since they “are Voluntary Collections of simple Ideas, which the Mind puts together” (II.xxxi.3) and therefore are intended only to represent themselves.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'adequate simple ideas of sensation I am perceiving right now are due to a dream or a\\n', 'memory. The question concerning these two constraints on having knowledge is\\n', 'whether my ideas meaningfully represent real things (causes) external to me that can\\n', 'or did exist regardless of whether those real things exist right now.71\\n', '3.II.3.1 Why simple ideas of sensation conform to their causes\\n', 'Locke explains that simple ideas of sensation are a part of the natural response we have\\n', 'to being affected by things through our senses. Such is the way in which God has\\n', 'created us: When external things impinge on us, we perceive simple ideas of primary\\n', 'and secondary qualities. They are “ordained by our Maker, to produce in us such\\n', 'Sensations; they are real Ideas in us, whereby we distinguish the Qualities, that are\\n', 'really in things themselves” (II.xxx.2). Because simple ideas of sensation are divinely\\n', 'designated effects of external causes affecting the senses, in performing their function,\\n', 'they necessarily correspond to those causes (things) they are designated to represent:\\n', 'For these several Appearances, being designed to be the Marks, whereby we are to know, and\\n', 'distinguish Things, which we have to do with; our Ideas do as well serve us to that purpose, and\\n', 'are as real distinguishing Characters, whether they be only constant Effects, or else exact\\n', 'Resemblances of something in the things themselves: the reality lying in that steady corres-\\n', 'pondence, they have with the distinct Constitutions of real Beings. But whether they answer to\\n', 'those Constitutions, as to Causes, or Patterns, it matters not; it suffices, that they are constantly produced by them. And thus our simple Ideas are all real and true, because they answer and\\n', 'agree to those Powers of Things, which produce them in our Minds, and that being all that is\\n', 'requisite to make them real, and not fictions at Pleasure. (II.xxx.2)\\n', 'The conformity to reality enjoyed by simple ideas, then, has nothing to do with how\\n', 'well they actually resemble the things for which they serve as marks. In fact, that a\\n', 'particular idea distinguishes a particular cause is in some respects an arbitrary\\n', 'decision of God’s. Rather, conformity consists in the regularity of the correspondence\\n', 'of an effect (idea) to a cause (power of a thing to produce the idea). So simple ideas\\n', 'mark the existence of the powers of real things to produce in us those ideas. As Locke\\n', 'states, they are “the Marks, whereby we are to know, and distinguish Things, which\\n', 'we have to do with.” Simple ideas correspond to really existing things as effects\\n', 'regularly correspond to causes, while “fantastical” ideas “have no Foundation in\\n', 'Nature, nor have any Conformity with that reality of Being, to which they are tacitly\\n', 'referr’d, as to their Archetypes” (II.xxx.1). Because fantastical ideas do not enjoy a\\n', '“steady correspondence” with those things they are taken to correspond to, they\\n', 'cannot be said to conform to reality.\\n', '\\n', 'Simple sensory ideas are all adequate, because they are perfect representations of\\n', 'the archetypes they are supposed or intended by the mind to represent:\\n', '71 Neither does it preclude that there is only a single cause, say, an evil demon. I address this issue partially in section 3.II.4 and more completely in part III. See also Bolton (2004a).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'Those I call Adequate, which perfectly represent those Archetypes, which the Mind supposes\\n', 'them taken from; which it intends them to stand for, and to which it refers them.

Indeed, the kind of relation Locke is talking about in his discussion of how\\n', 'adequate ideas conform to their archetypes fits awkwardly (if at all) with his\\n', 'discussion of the way in which our simple ideas of primary and secondary qualities\\n', 'do (or do not) resemble those qualities/powers in the objects causing our ideas.\\n', '\\n', 'Simple ideas are adequate because they just are the designated effects of particular\\n', 'causes—they are complete representations regardless of whether or not they resem-\\n', 'ble them.

Locke gives us the following example:\\n', 'For if Sugar produce in us the Ideas, which we call Whiteness, and Sweetness, we are sure there\\n', 'is a power in Sugar to produce those Ideas in our Minds, or else they could not have been\\n', 'produced by it. And so each Sensation answering the Power, that operates on any of our\\n', 'Senses, the Idea so produced, is a real Idea, (and not a fiction of the Mind, which has no power\\n', 'to produce any simple Idea;) and cannot but be adequate, since it ought only to answer that\\n', 'power: and so all simple Ideas are adequate.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxxi.2)\\n', '72 Complex ideas of substances are also inadequate insofar as we intend them to represent real essences (II.xxxi.6–7).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'But what is the nature of this assurance that simple ideas reach out to their causes?\\n', '\\n', 'We can understand Locke to be saying that because we are passive recipients of the\\n', 'powers of things (whatever they may be) to produce these real and adequate ideas in\\n', 'us through our senses, we can be assured that they result from the things we are\\n', 'passive to. But that assurance is due to the way in which simple ideas necessarily\\n', 'fulfill the factual conditions (of regular correspondence and perfect representation)\\n', 'for conformity to their causes or archetypes—for conformity to the really existing\\n', 'powers that produce them.\\n', '\\n', 'Given Locke’s understanding of the reality and adequacy of simple sensory ideas,\\n', 'I suggest that analogously to our knowledge of general truths, when we have a simple\\n', 'sensory idea, there exists the possibility of “real” knowledge of a really existing\\n', 'thing.73 Locke distinguishes “real” knowledge here:\\n', 'Where-ever we perceive the Agreement or Disagreement of any of our Ideas, there is certain\\n', 'Knowledge: and where-ever we are sure those Ideas agree with the reality of Things, there is\\n', 'certain real Knowledge.

This is the way in which simple sensory ideas “reach out” to “something\\n', 'farther intended” (IV.iv.2). Locke confirms as much in this passage:\\n', 'for they [simple ideas] represent to us Things under those appearances which they are fitted to\\n', 'produce in us: whereby we are enabled to distinguish the sorts of particular Substances, to\\n', 'discern the states they are in, and so to take them for our Necessities, and apply them to our\\n', 'Uses.

[T]he idea’s descriptive content is the appearance the sensing produces . . . and so, by necessary complementation, the active power, as the thing represented through that appearance, is also contained in the idea.” I am not, though, necessarily committed to Hill’s further claim that “the power being exemplified and the idea being sensed are merely different descriptions of one and the same event.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'co-existing collection of powers to produce simple ideas. “Our complex Ideas of\\n', 'Substances,” says Locke, “being made all of them in reference to Things existing\\n', 'without us, and intended to be Representations of Substances, as they really are, are\\n', 'no farther real, than as they are such Combinations of simple Ideas, as are really\\n', 'united, and co-exist in Things without us” (II.xxx.5).

In terms of the proposition\\n', 'expressing an instance of sensitive knowledge, including the externalist justificatory\\n', 'element takes us from “Existence agreeing to an Idea,” which would include fictions,\\n', 'to “real Existence agreeing to an Idea” (my emphasis in bold), which would not.\\n', '\\n', 'Remember, though, that sensitive knowledge is not just the assurance in virtue of\\n', 'their representational function that our sensory ideas reach out to real things.

Here are a few examples:\\n', 'The Knowledge of the Existence of any other thing we can have only by Sensation: For there\\n', 'being no necessary connexion of real Existence, with any Idea a Man hath in his Memory, nor\\n', '75 Let me be clear that this is neither a claim that I have knowledge of the necessary co-existence of qualities or powers in a subject nor a claim that my ideas of substances are real or adequate.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'of any other Existence but that of God, with the Existence of any particular Man; no particular\\n', 'Man can know the Existence of any other Being, but only when by actual operating upon him,\\n', 'it makes it self perceived by him. For the having the Idea of any thing in our Mind, no more\\n', 'proves the Existence of that Thing, than the picture of a Man evidences his being in the World,\\n', 'or the Visions of a Dream make thereby a true History.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.xi.1)\\n', '’Tis therefore the actual receiving of Ideas from without, that gives us notice of the Existence of other Things, and makes us know, that something doth exist at that time without us, which\\n', 'causes that Idea in us . . . v.g. whilst I write this, I have, by the Paper affecting my Eyes, that Idea produced in my Mind, which whatever Object causes, I call White; by which I know, that that\\n', 'Quality or Accident (i.e. whose appearance before my Eyes, always causes that Idea) doth really\\n', 'exist, and hath a being without me.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.xi.2)\\n', 'But this [sensitive] Knowledge extends as far as the present Testimony of our Senses, employ’d\\n', 'about particular Objects, that do then affect them, and no farther.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.xi.9)76\\n', 'These passages seem to be saying the same thing. We have knowledge of the real\\n', 'existence of external objects when they are “actually operating” on us, “whilst” the\\n', 'paper is affecting our eyes, “at that time” that “the Objects are present to our Senses,”\\n', 'and when the testimony from the senses is the result of objects that “do then affect”\\n', 'us. Locke must be thinking that sensitive knowledge requires that the perceived idea\\n', 'of an object is an occurrent idea of sensation.\\n', '\\n', 'One might here be concerned that the sensory idea of the external object is not really\\n', 'occurrent, since it is a complex idea composed from a collection of simple ones.\\n', '\\n', 'Although Locke often speaks of our having ideas of external objects in his account of\\n', 'sensitive knowledge, which I also take to be a complex idea, he also tells us, “Though\\n', 'the qualities that affect our Senses, are, in the things themselves, so united and blended,\\n', 'that there is no separation, no distance between them; yet ’tis plain, the Ideas they\\n', 'produce in the Mind, enter by the Senses simple and unmixed” (II.ii.1). Of course, we\\n', 'do not usually experience being affected through the senses by each power/quality of\\n', 'the object individually. This might be why in explaining the individuality of simple\\n', 'ideas, Locke speaks of “the coldness and hardness, which a Man feels in a piece of Ice,”\\n', '“the Smell and Whiteness of a Lily,” and “the taste of Sugar, and smell of a Rose”\\n', '(II.ii.1). Moreover, and importantly, Locke thinks simple ideas enter the mind together,\\n', 'at the same time. For example, “Sight and Touch often take in from the same Object, at\\n', 'the same time, different Ideas; as a Man sees at once Motion and Colour; the hand feels\\n', 'Softness and Warmth in the same piece of Wax” (II.ii.1). So, even though our\\n', 'experience is of a whole external object affecting the senses, really it is a collection of\\n', 'occurrent simple ideas of sensation, all of which representationally capture their causes.\\n', '\\n', 'Locke seems to say as much in this passage about the scope of sensitive knowledge:\\n', 'But this Knowledge extends as far as the present Testimony of our Senses, employ’d about\\n', 'particular Objects, that do then affect them, and no farther. For if I saw such a collection of\\n', '76 See also IV.iii.21 and IV.iii.5.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'simple Ideas as is wont to be called a Man, existing together one minute since, and am now\\n', 'alone, I cannot be certain, that the same Man exists now, since there is no necessary connexion\\n', 'of his Existence a minute since, with his Existence now.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.xi.9)\\n', 'On my view, I have sensitive knowledge insofar as I am perceiving the “collection of\\n', 'simple Ideas as is wont to be called” an external object, namely the occurrent simple\\n', 'ideas of sensation. In some cases, I may perceive only a portion of the possible simple\\n', 'sensory ideas producible by any given object, say only the coldness and hardness, but\\n', 'not the bluish color of the piece of ice. In that moment, I have sensitive knowledge of\\n', 'whatever has the power to produce in me those particular simple ideas. Note that\\n', 'Locke makes this distinction himself in the passage above from IV.xi.2. Therefore, for\\n', 'Locke, we have sensitive knowledge only when we are perceiving occurrent ideas of\\n', 'sensation—when we are actually being affected through the senses.\\n', '\\n', 'Second, just as we have externalist justification that the simple ideas of sensation\\n', 'collected in our idea of an object correspond to a real existence, Locke thinks that we\\n', 'also have internalist justification. To understand better how we have first-personal\\n', '(internal) justification, let us turn to Locke’s own description of our experience in\\n', 'having sensitive knowledge. As discussed earlier, Locke begins his IV.ii.14 discussion\\n', 'of it by differentiating sensitive knowledge from intuitive and demonstrative know-\\n', 'ledge. As well as the “Knowledge . . . of general Truths” that come by way of intuition\\n', 'and demonstration, “There is,” Locke says, “indeed, another Perception of the Mind,\\n', 'employ’d about the particular existence of finite Beings without us” (IV.ii.14). Sensitive\\n', 'knowledge consists in knowing that there exists a particular external object—or at\\n', 'least something to produce an idea of one. Locke’s explanation proceeds as follows.\\n', '\\n', 'First, “There can be nothing more certain, than that the Idea we receive from an\\n', 'external Object is in our Minds; this is intuitive Knowledge” (IV.ii.14). When we have\\n', 'an idea as of an external object we know that we do. We have intuitive knowledge of\\n', 'the idea. But on what grounds are we justified in claiming that that idea corresponds to\\n', 'something really existing external to us right now? Here is Locke’s answer:\\n', 'But yet here, I think, we are provided with an Evidence that puts us past doubting: For I ask any\\n', 'one, Whether he be not invincibly conscious to himself of a different Perception, when he\\n', 'looks on the Sun by day, and thinks on it by night; when he actually tastes Wormwood, or\\n', 'smells a Rose, or only thinks on that Savour, or Odour? We as plainly find the difference there\\n', 'is between any Idea revived in our Minds by our own Memory, and actually coming into our\\n', 'Minds by our Senses, as we do between any two distinct Ideas.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ii.14)\\n', 'One way to read this passage is to say that, when compared, ideas of sensation feel\\n', 'different to us than do ideas from memory. Then, on the basis of that knowledge we\\n', 'can draw an inference to the existence of the object.77 But remember that sensitive\\n', 'knowledge arises only when there is an occurrent idea of sensation—only when we are\\n', '77 See Newman (2004, 2007).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'actually sensing. Therefore, the “evidence” Locke speaks of in this passage must be the\\n', 'result of, and so available only when we are, perceiving an occurrent sensory idea.\\n', '\\n', 'I suggest that Locke’s response is that we already have an internalist form of justifi-\\n', 'cation for sensitive knowledge in the perception of the idea of the object itself. It is a\\n', 'part of the complex mental state. That is, “whilst” I perceive an occurrent idea of the\\n', 'sun (or to use Locke’s example, “whilst” the paper in front of me is affecting my eyes\\n', '(IV.xi.2)), I cannot but experience the idea as originating in my senses.78 In such a\\n', 'case, I am conscious of the idea (the apparent intrinsic features of it) as from sensation.\\n', '\\n', 'I need not make an additional inference to the present existence of the object.79\\n', 'Similarly, I would just know that when I am thinking of the sun later that evening\\n', 'I am remembering the sun. I am conscious of the idea as from memory. Remember\\n', 'what Locke says about memory: “the Mind has a Power . . . to revive Perceptions,\\n', 'which it has once had, with this additional Perception annexed to them, that it has\\n', 'had them before” (II.x.2). Evidence that by the “additional perception” Locke means\\n', 'consciousness is found in I.iv.20:\\n', 'For to remember is to perceive any thing with memory, or with a consciousness, that it was\\n', 'known or perceived before: without this, whatever Idea comes into the mind is new, and not\\n', 'remembered: This consciousness of it having been in the mind before, being that, which\\n', 'distinguishes Remembring from all other ways of Thinking.\\n', '\\n', 'Consciousness as internal to the perception of the revived idea accounts for our\\n', 'occurrent experience of the idea as from memory. Likewise, consciousness as internal\\n', 'to the perception of an occurrent idea of sensation accounts for our experience of the\\n', 'idea as from sensation. In being conscious of myself as perceiving the idea, I am\\n', 'conscious of the manner of perception. Moreover, this distinction between my\\n', 'experience of sensing, say, the sun, and remembering it later that night cannot be\\n', 'due to the object of the perception, since both ideas are of the sun. Both perceptions\\n', 'are of ideas of a really existing sun. Therefore, I have epistemic evidence for sensitive\\n', 'knowledge in my consciousness of the way of perceiving. That there actually exists\\n', 'something external to me affecting my senses is experienced as internal to the\\n', 'perception of the occurrent sensory idea. Because consciousness is a constituent of\\n', 'a perception of an idea, it is a part of the complex mental state. This ability to detect\\n', 'the sources of our ideas is not unfamiliar to contemporary cognitive scientists. Such\\n', 'experience of identifying phenomenal characteristics concerning what sort of mental\\n', 'state we are in, or where our mental states are coming from, as a part of that mental\\n', 'state itself is often called “source-monitoring.” According to Johnson (1998: 181),\\n', '78 Allen (2013), Weinberg (2013), and Nagel (forthcoming) all include internalist justification of this sort.\\n', '\\n', '79 Both Allen (2013) and Weinberg (2013) see sensitive knowledge as non-inferential. Wilson (2014:\\n', '13–14) argues that Allen’s inclusion of a reflective idea in the agreement perceived does not preclude that on his (Allen’s) account sensitive knowledge could be inferential.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', '“whether information is taken to be memories, knowledge, or reasonable beliefs is\\n', 'based on its phenomenal properties.”80\\n', 'But contrary to Allen (2013: 256–7) and Nagel (forthcoming), I do not (and as I will\\n', 'argue in section II.5, we should not) see the internal justificatory element as due to an\\n', 'idea of reflection. On my view, it is the complex mental state that is the perception of\\n', 'an occurrent idea of sensation that conveys sensitive knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'That consciousness is responsible for our experience of the way of perceiving gains\\n', 'support a few lines later when Locke concludes the IV.ii.14 description of sensitive\\n', 'knowledge with the following passage:\\n', 'So that, I think, we may add to the two former sorts of Knowledge, this also, of the existence of\\n', 'particular external Objects, by that perception and Consciousness we have of the actual\\n', 'entrance of Ideas from them, and allow these three degrees of Knowledge, viz. Intuitive,\\n', 'Demonstrative, and Sensitive: in each of which, there are different degrees and ways of\\n', 'Evidence and Certainty.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ii.14)\\n', 'Sensitive knowledge is due to the “perception and Consciousness we have of the actual\\n', 'entrance of Ideas.” We should take this passage to confirm the interpretation put\\n', 'forward. Because we are conscious of our ideas as having different sources, namely as\\n', 'being in the mind by different ways of perception, sensitive knowledge enjoys a degree of\\n', 'certainty that qualifies it as a species of knowledge. In addition, Locke says, “Where-ever\\n', 'the Mind perceives the Agreement or Disagreement of any of its Ideas, there be certain\\n', 'knowledge” (IV.ii.2). So perceiving the idea as from sensation is a part of the agreement\\n', 'constituting sensitive knowledge. Therefore, when we perceive an occurrent idea as of an\\n', 'external object (an occurrent collection of real and adequate simple ideas of sensation),\\n', 'we are justified in claiming that the real existence captured in the idea is presently\\n', '(actually) affecting our senses. Insofar as we are experiencing that complex mental state,\\n', 'we know the agreement constituting an instance of sensitive knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'Each element (or commitment) important to Locke’s account of sensitive know-\\n', 'ledge is now accounted for and can be seen as coherently expressed in the IV.i.7\\n', 'proposition describing the agreement (the true state of affairs) guaranteeing sensitive\\n', 'knowledge. The two ideas as required by the general definition of knowledge are an\\n', 'idea of an object and an accompanying idea of existence, giving us “existence agreeing\\n', 'to any Idea” or an experience as of an external object. That this idea (insofar as it is a\\n', 'collection of simple sensory ideas) is “real” and “adequate” provides a form of\\n', 'externalist justification that the existence we are talking about is “real Existence\\n', 'agreeing to any Idea.” That the occurrent idea as of an external object is consciously\\n', 'experienced as from sensation provides a form of internalist justification that the real\\n', 'existence we are talking about is “actual real Existence agreeing to any Idea,” which is\\n', '80 Nagel (forthcoming) notes this connection between Locke and contemporary accounts of “source-\\n', 'monitoring,” but she argues that it is due to a contemporaneous idea of reflection. Allen (2013: 259) considers the view that our ability to distinguish our ways of perceiving is due to something intrinsic to the perception of the idea, such as force or vivacity, but then rejects it.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'the proposition Locke uses in IV.i.7 to express the agreement perceived (the true state\\n', 'of affairs) in an instance of sensitive knowledge. Therefore, the complex mental state\\n', 'that is the perception of an occurrent sensory idea of an object is the state of affairs\\n', 'expressed that is also the state of the true proposition known in an instance of\\n', 'sensitive knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'So that there is no confusion, let me acknowledge that implied in this interpret-\\n', 'ation is that sensitive knowledge is non-inferential.81 Sensitive knowledge does not\\n', 'require an inference from an idea to the existence of an external object. Consistent\\n', 'with knowing our own ideas and knowing ourselves, I am again relying on Locke’s\\n', '“one-act” view of knowledge wherein knowing agreements does not require a\\n', 'separate act of the mind: perceiving the agreement, forming the proposition, and\\n', 'knowing it to be true are all achieved as a part of the same mental act. Moreover, we\\n', 'know agreements internal to the perception of an idea because those perceptions are\\n', 'complex mental states with constituent agreeing elements: an idea perceived, an idea\\n', 'of existence, and consciousness. Perceptions of ideas are complex propositional\\n', 'states. As already established, as the result of this complexity when I perceive any\\n', 'idea, I have intuitive knowledge of the idea and of my own existence. When the idea\\n', 'perceived is an occurrent idea of sensation, in addition, I have sensitive knowledge,\\n', 'namely knowledge of the actual real existence of the particular object represented by\\n', 'the idea, or more accurately, by the collection of simple sensory ideas. Therefore, the\\n', 'role of consciousness as a constituent of a more complex mental state makes possible\\n', 'that we are able to have knowledge of particular things, namely perceive the agree-\\n', 'ments in knowing an individual idea, in knowing our own existence, and in knowing\\n', 'the existence of a particular finite thing outside of me as Locke describes them. And\\n', 'knowing these agreements is fully consistent with his general definition of know-\\n', 'ledge. The complexity of the mental state that is the perception of an idea and the role\\n', 'consciousness plays in it allow for a coherent and unified account of how, for Locke,\\n', 'we can have knowledge of particular things.82 In part III, I will provide more\\n', 'argumentation that sensitive knowledge is non-inferential as well as address the\\n', 'consequences of such a view.\\n', '\\n', 'At this point one might want to object that this is not a very robust account of\\n', 'sensitive knowledge, for it is consistent that the cause of my sensory ideas is an evil\\n', 'demon or something radically different from what I think it is. I will offer three\\n', '81 I am not the first to combine Locke’s representational theory of perception with a non-inferential reading of sensitive knowledge. See Ayers (1991, I: 94, 159) and Owen (1999: 33). Owen says, “Two sorts of knowledge, for Locke, are direct and immediate: these are intuitive and sensitive knowledge. . . . I will assume that sensitive knowledge, like intuitive knowledge, is immediate and non-inferential, i.e. that Locke assumes that it involves no process of reasoning.” There is looming, however, the problem of finding logical space for sensitive knowledge, given Locke’s definitions of intuitive knowledge as non-inferential and demonstrative knowledge as inferential. I will address this problem in part III of this chapter.\\n', '\\n', '82 The only other particular thing we have knowledge of, for Locke, is God’s existence. But Locke\\n', 'explains that as a form of demonstrative knowledge or knowledge by way of proof, which is necessarily consistent with his general definition of knowledge.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'preliminary replies now and reserve for part III a full examination of how Locke’s\\n', 'account of sensitive knowledge includes a textually and philosophically satisfactory\\n', 'reply to the skeptical challenge. First, Locke himself does not seem to think sensitive\\n', 'knowledge is immune to an evil demon doubt. In response to more pressure from the\\n', 'skeptic after his explanation that our experience of sensing provides sufficient\\n', '“evidence” for sensitive knowledge, he replies:\\n', 'If any one say, a Dream may do the same thing, and all these Ideas may be produced in us,\\n', 'without any external Objects; he may please to dream that I make him this Answer: 1. That ’tis\\n', 'no great matter, whether I remove his Scruple, or no: Where all is but Dream, Reasoning and\\n', 'Arguments are of no use, Truth and Knowledge nothing.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ii.14)\\n', 'I take Locke to be saying that the global skeptical question has little import for his\\n', 'account of sensitive knowledge, since if it is true, then his entire empiricist enterprise\\n', 'to discover the limits of knowledge is irrelevant.\\n', '\\n', 'Second, that I have not rendered sensitive knowledge immune to the global skeptic\\n', 'would not place my interpretation in any worse shape than other recent attempts to\\n', 'explain the nature of the agreement.83 Moreover, one might want to think mine better,\\n', 'since it is consistent with Locke’s definition of knowledge as the perception of an\\n', 'agreement of ideas (the perception of a true proposition) and with his expression of\\n', 'that agreement as an “actual real Existence agreeing to an Idea.”84 It also has the added\\n', 'advantage that it incorporates all that Locke says about how our ideas are in relation to\\n', 'an external world and how we come to have knowledge of it—both the externalist and\\n', 'internalist justificatory elements. What is more, it explains how the state of affairs\\n', 'guaranteeing the truth of the proposition known is also the composition or structure\\n', 'of the true proposition itself. And the interpretation comes at no cost. In addition, it\\n', 'does all of that not only in a way consistent with the role of consciousness in Locke’s\\n', 'model of the mind, but also by showing that Locke can be seen to have a coherent and\\n', 'unified account of all three cases in which we have non-inferential knowledge of\\n', 'particular things. Furthermore, contrary to some recent interpretations, mine is\\n', 'consistent with Locke’s explicit claims that we have sensitive knowledge only when\\n', 'we are being presently affected through the senses, only when we are perceiving\\n', 'occurrent ideas of sensation. I will have more to say about this in section II.5.\\n', '\\n', 'Finally, as odd as we might find it, Locke himself claims that sensitive knowledge is\\n', 'a less certain form of knowledge and indeed provides a series of probabilistic\\n', 'arguments in defense of it. Any epistemic justification provided in addition to our\\n', '83 Neither Newman (2004), Rickless (2008, forthcoming), Allen (2013), nor Nagel (forthcoming)\\n', 'renders sensitive knowledge immune to global skepticism.\\n', '\\n', '84 Allen (2013) and Nagel (forthcoming) also seem to resolve this tension, but Allen (2013: 256) first rejects the thought that the simple idea of existence plays a role and then claims that one of the ideas is an\\n', '“idea of actual real existence” without providing any real explanation where this idea comes from. In addition, both Nagel and Allen saddle Locke with the consequences of having consciousness the source of a reflective idea.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'experience of sensing is fully consistent with my interpretation of the agreement.\\n', '\\n', 'Therefore, I have a coherent interpretation of the agreement perceived in sensitive\\n', 'knowledge that takes account of all that Locke says about how we achieve contact\\n', 'with an external world. In addition, I have shown why sensitive knowledge is\\n', 'expressed as “actual real Existence agreeing to an idea,” even though it is a case of\\n', 'ideational agreement. In part III of this chapter, I will fill out my interpretation of\\n', 'Locke’s account of sensitive knowledge by showing why sensitive knowledge, even\\n', 'though non-inferential, is a less certain form of knowledge falling somewhere\\n', 'between the certainty of demonstrative knowledge and probability. I will also provide\\n', 'more explanation why it makes sense that Locke includes a series of probabilistic\\n', 'arguments in support of it.\\n', '\\n', '3.II.5 Locke’s Reply to Stillingfleet\\n', 'Before we move on, I should provide some analysis of a passage that has become\\n', 'quite famous from the Correspondence with Stillingfleet where Locke seems to state\\n', 'the agreement perceived in sensitive knowledge:\\n', 'Now the two ideas, that in this case are perceived to agree, and do thereby produce knowledge, are\\n', 'the idea of actual sensation (which is an action whereof I have a clear and distinct idea) and the\\n', 'idea of actual existence of something without me that causes that sensation.\\n', '\\n', '(Works, IV: 360)\\n', 'Recently, contrary to what I am arguing here, some have interpreted “the idea of actual\\n', 'sensation” as a reflective idea of sensation (an idea of reflection) and “the idea of\\n', 'actual existence of something without me that causes that sensation” as an idea of an\\n', 'external cause.85 I think there are two reasons to be suspicious that Locke is not as\\n', 'careful as he should have been in his reply to Stillingfleet, for this reading of “idea of\\n', 'actual sensation” conflicts with passages already cited in the Essay and even with a\\n', 'preceding passage in the Correspondence with Stillingfleet itself. Let us see why. Were\\n', 'we to see “the idea of actual sensation” as a reflective idea, three interpretations are\\n', 'possible, none of which comes without significant cost. On the one hand, the reflective\\n', 'idea can be generated just after having the idea of sensation. That is, immediately\\n', 'following the perception of an idea of sensation there would be a reflection on that\\n', 'mental operation of sensing resulting in the reflective idea of sensation. Having to\\n', 'reflect on my present sensation in order to generate the “idea of actual sensation”\\n', 'would require an additional mental act following the experience of sensing itself. But\\n', 'this reading contradicts those passages in which Locke states that we have sensitive\\n', 'knowledge in the moment, or only when, we are being presently affected through\\n', 'the senses.86\\n', '85 Newman (2004, 2007), Rickless (2008), and Nagel (forthcoming). Allen (2013) argues that the\\n', 'agreement is between a reflective idea of sensation and an idea of an actual real existence.\\n', '\\n', '86 See, again, IV.ii.5, IV.iii.21, IV.xi.2, and IV.xi.9.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'On the other hand, we could interpret Locke as saying that the (reflective) idea of\\n', 'actual sensation is brought into contemporaneity with the idea of the external cause.\\n', '\\n', 'But then the idea would be of a past experience of sensing, namely from memory,\\n', 'which is something Locke emphatically denies in a statement to Stillingfleet just prior\\n', 'to the passage cited above:\\n', 'But if you had been pleased to have considered my answer there to the sceptics, whose cause\\n', 'you seem, with no small vigour, to manage; you would, I humbly conceive, have found that you\\n', 'mistake one thing for another, viz. the idea that has by a former sensation been lodged in the\\n', 'mind, for actually receiving any idea, i.e. actual sensation.\\n', '\\n', '(Works, IV: 360)\\n', 'Here Locke is clear that he does not mean “actual sensation” to refer to a reflective idea\\n', 'that has been generated at some other time and retrieved from memory, namely an\\n', '“idea that has by a former sensation been lodged in the mind” (my emphasis). Rather,\\n', 'he seems to confirm that “actual sensation” refers to an occurrent idea of sensation.\\n', '\\n', 'On the third hand, one can argue as does Nagel (forthcoming) that in being\\n', 'conscious of a sensory idea there is occurrently generated a reflective idea of sensation,\\n', 'which if successful would escape my other two objections.87 I do not, however, think it\\n', 'is successful, for in making that argument Nagel has identified consciousness with the\\n', 'mental operation of reflection, which results in a textual conflict between Locke’s\\n', 'claims that all perception is conscious (II.i.19, II.i.25), but young children do not yet\\n', 'have ideas of reflection (II.i.8). So Nagel must find herself either contradicting Locke’s\\n', 'explicit position concerning the reflective abilities of young children or as denying\\n', 'that young children have sensitive knowledge. Recognizing that Locke disallows\\n', 'reflection in young children, Nagel (forthcoming) takes the second route: “It is a\\n', 'consequence of the view suggested here that very small children with no ideas of\\n', 'reflection whatsoever will not have sensitive knowledge; to the extent that very small\\n', 'children are poor judges of the distinction between reality and fantasy this might not\\n', 'be an unwelcome result.” But this solution is unavailable to Nagel, for her interpret-\\n', 'ation actually entails that young children have sensitive knowledge. The reason is that\\n', 'Locke is committed to the view that young children have what in II.i.25 he calls\\n', '“obscure Notions” of their own thinking. And Nagel explicitly equates these “obscure\\n', 'Notions” with the reflective ideas that guarantee sensitive knowledge. Let me try to\\n', 'clarify this point.\\n', '\\n', 'First, consider again what Locke says in II.i.25:\\n', 'When the Objects of our Senses, do, many of them, obtrude their particular Ideas upon our minds,\\n', 'whether we will or no: And the Operations of our minds will not let us be without at least some\\n', 'obscure Notions of them. No man can be totally ignorant of what he does when he thinks.\\n', '\\n', '(II.i.25)\\n', '87 Although he does not say so specifically, Allen’s (2013: 257) distinction between “having” and\\n', '“receiving” ideas leads me to think that his view is similar in this respect to Nagel’s. At least, I think, the most charitable way to read him is that the idea of reflection is generated occurrently when we have an idea as the result of being affected through the senses.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Locke’s claim that “no man,” namely no one, “can be ignorant of what he does when\\n', 'he thinks” is just his view that all thinking, regardless of the thinker, is conscious.\\n', '\\n', 'As first recognized by Kulstad (1991), if all thinking is conscious, and the obscure\\n', 'notions are ideas of reflection, then consciousness is identified with reflection.\\n', '\\n', 'Because young children are conscious, they must be having ideas of reflection—\\n', 'contrary to Locke’s view.\\n', '\\n', 'Next, consider Nagel’s view. After citing the famous IV.ii.14 passage in which\\n', 'Locke claims that we can just tell the difference between an occurrent sensation of the\\n', 'sun and a memory of the sun, Nagel explicitly equates the “obscure Notions” in II.\\n', '\\n', 'i.25 with ideas of reflection:\\n', 'Locke claims here that the character of our present mode of thought, whether sensation or\\n', 'recollection, is always available to us: we are “invincibly conscious” of the way in which any\\n', 'given idea is presenting itself to us, as well as the content of the idea presented. Earlier in the Essay Locke had advanced the milder claim that “the operations of our minds, will not let us be\\n', 'without, at least some obscure Notions of them” (2.1.25); it now seems that even these obscure\\n', 'notions must always be distinct enough that there is no risk of our mistaking recollection for\\n', 'sensation. The perception one enjoys when seeing the sun is different from the perception\\n', 'involved in recollecting it, not in virtue of any of the sensible qualities the sun is represented as having, but in virtue of one’s own current mode of thought, of the operations of one’s mind.\\n', '\\n', 'The operations of the mind generate what Locke calls ideas of reflection.

It is uncontroversial\\n', 'to say that Locke’s treatment of the skeptical problem is considered by most to be\\n', 'inadequate. Locke is often accused of having an “insouciant” attitude toward the\\n', 'problem, which is even more puzzling given his textual commitments to a represen-\\n', 'tational theory of perception with the ensuing “veil of ideas.” If ideas are the imme-\\n', 'diate objects of perception, and knowledge is internal to ideas, then why would he\\n', 'want to insist that we have sensitive knowledge at all? More natural would be to take\\n', 'the skeptical problem seriously by concluding that all we really achieve is highly\\n', 'probable judgment that the causes of our ideas really do exist when we are sensing\\n', 'them. But he does not. Locke claims that sensitive knowledge is a species of knowledge\\n', 'with a degree of certainty. What is more, although Locke claims that sensitive\\n', 'knowledge counts as a species of knowledge, rather than a species of judgment, he\\n', 'also seems to offer a series of probabilistic arguments in defense of sensitive know-\\n', 'ledge. But the proper role for probabilistic arguments in Locke’s scheme of things is to\\n', 'support judgment, not knowledge. If Locke really thinks that we have some sort of\\n', 'knowledge of the external world, then what work does he see the probabilistic\\n', 'arguments doing? And if he intends the probabilistic arguments as epistemic justifi-\\n', 'cation for sensitive knowledge, then why does he consider it knowledge and why does\\n', 'he not take the skeptic more seriously?\\n', '\\n', 'We can, fortunately, answer these questions and, indeed, show that Locke’s theory of\\n', 'knowledge allows for a consistent, interesting, and philosophically satisfactory reply to\\n', 'the skeptic. To get started, notice that we can see the skeptical challenge in two ways.\\n', '\\n', 'First, we can see the skeptic as asking how we can know the existence of external things.\\n', '\\n', 'Second, we can see the skeptic as asking more specifically how we can know inferentially\\n', 'of the existence of external things. That is, given a representational theory of perception,\\n', 'what reason do we have to think that the ideas we perceive really do represent an\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'external world? I have argued that Locke’s account of sensitive knowledge provides an\\n', 'answer to the first question, which reveals that the second question is based on a false\\n', 'presupposition. The reason is that sensitive knowledge, for Locke, is a form of non-\\n', 'inferential knowledge. We know the agreement constituting sensitive knowledge as\\n', 'internal to the perception of an idea due to the complexity of our perceptual states. As\\n', 'far as the existence of particular outer things is concerned, all we can achieve by\\n', 'inference is highly probable judgment. Therefore, the probabilistic arguments Locke\\n', 'provides should not be understood as Locke’s defense of the claim that sensitive\\n', 'knowledge counts as knowledge. Rather they should be seen more as Locke describes\\n', 'them—as “concurrent” reasons to shore up what we already sensitively (non-\\n', 'inferentially) know. It is unusual, I admit, to speak of buttressing knowledge with\\n', 'probabilistic arguments. But it is also unusual, as Locke has it, for knowledge to come\\n', 'in degrees according to certainty and for one of those degrees to fall somewhere in\\n', 'between probability and knowledge proper. Locke’s reply to the skeptical challenge,\\n', 'I suggest, is found in his analysis of the different degrees of knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'Interpreting sensitive knowledge as non-inferential, though, seems to saddle Locke\\n', 'with an internal incoherence, a potential problem that, as promised, I will now\\n', 'address. Unfortunately, despite Locke’s claims that we actually do have “knowledge\\n', 'of the real existence of particular finite beings without us” (IV.ii.14, IV.xi.3), and the\\n', 'arguments marshaled so far in defense of the agreement and how we perceive it, he\\n', 'seems to have left no logical space for it. Agreements perceived immediately (without\\n', 'intervening ideas) are intuitive, while agreements perceived mediately (requiring\\n', 'intervening ideas) are demonstrative. Locke seems to be aware of the problem in\\n', 'IV.ii.14, when he states “These two, (viz.) Intuition and Demonstration, are the\\n', 'degrees of our Knowledge; whatever comes short of one of these, with what assurance\\n', 'soever embraced, is but Faith, or Opinion, but not Knowledge.” He then adds, “at\\n', 'least in all general Truths,” which suggests that when the proposition is not general,\\n', 'as would be the case with a proposition asserting the real existence of a particular\\n', 'external object, it can count as knowledge although it falls short of intuition and\\n', 'demonstration. But still Locke has gained no ground.\\n', '\\n', 'The problem for the scholarship is that it seems impossible to maintain coherently\\n', 'that there can be three kinds of knowledge when there are only two ways in which\\n', 'agreements can be perceived, immediately, which is intuitive knowledge, and with the\\n', 'help of intervening ideas, which is demonstrative knowledge.88 Others have tried to\\n', 'address this difficulty in different ways. Newman (2004, 2007: 325) argues that in\\n', 'sensitive knowledge there are two different cognitions: “an idea of sensation stands in\\n', 'dual cognitive relations: it stands both in a perceived agreement with another idea, and\\n', '88 See also Rickless (forthcoming) for specific arguments against both Nagel and Allen. Rickless (2008: 100 and forthcoming) argues that sensitive knowledge is not knowledge at all, but, rather, a judgment or presumption reaching “assurance” or the highest degree of probability. I address some problems with Rickless’s interpretation in section 3.III.3.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'in a causal relation with an external cause. Though cognition of the former relation\\n', 'explains why sensitive knowledge ‘passes under the name of Knowledge,’ cognition of\\n', 'the latter relation is integral and yet could pass for nothing stronger than probable\\n', 'judgment.” As noted by Rickless (2008: 91), Newman’s interpretation is philosophically\\n', 'shaky because it runs contrary to Locke’s emphatic philosophical distinction between\\n', 'knowledge and probable judgment or opinion. In addition, that there are “dual cogni-\\n', 'tive relations” in the same act of knowledge is textually thin. Nagel (forthcoming) argues\\n', 'that the agreement perceived—what constitutes knowledge—consists in “an agreement\\n', 'between the reflective idea of sensation and the idea of the real existence of an outer\\n', 'cause.” The reason why sensitive knowledge is less certain is that the “connection\\n', 'between the central content presented to one’s mind (in this case, the idea of the rose\\n', '[external object]) and one’s idea of one’s mode of thought (in this case, the [reflective]\\n', 'idea of actual sensation) . . . is one of mere temporal coincidence.” For Allen (2013: 262),\\n', 'sensitive knowledge is less certain, because “even when we are actually receiving ideas\\n', 'from without, a particular kind of doubt remains possible. . . . Whereas reason is\\n', 'employed about the ‘clear and abstract Ideas of our own Minds’ (E IV.xi.3), the reflective\\n', 'awareness of receiving ideas from without can be rendered indistinct and obscure by a\\n', 'failure to attend carefully to our own mental lives.” I pointed to problems I see with\\n', 'Nagel’s and Allen’s interpretations in part II of this chapter.\\n', '\\n', 'I have argued that the agreement in sensitive knowledge is perceived immediately\\n', '(non-inferentially), and I think there is a relatively easy way to allow three kinds of\\n', 'knowledge when there are only two ways of perceiving agreements. All that is needed is\\n', 'a slight change in taxonomy. Had Locke been more careful about what, in the end, he\\n', 'was committed to, he would (and should) have said the following: (1) all knowledge is\\n', 'the perception of an agreement or disagreement of ideas; (2) there are two ways of\\n', 'perceiving agreements or disagreements of ideas: immediately (non-inferentially) or\\n', 'mediately (inferentially); (3) intuitive and sensitive knowledge fall into the first category,\\n', 'while demonstrative knowledge falls into the second; (4) the degrees of certainty of\\n', 'knowledge can then depend on how well each form of knowledge meets other condi-\\n', 'tions. (I will argue that the other conditions are further normative conditions.)89\\n', 'Although this analysis might seem both tendentious and costly to the interpretation,\\n', 'I suggest that all it does is to swap the definitional terms. Instead of using “intuitive” and\\n', '“demonstrative” to denote ways of perceiving agreements (immediately and mediately),\\n', 'it uses “non-inferential” and “inferential.” Making this interpretive move makes sense of\\n', 'everything Locke says, except his use of “intuitive” exclusively to denote a non-\\n', 'inferential perception of an agreement of ideas. This is a more satisfying solution,\\n', 'since it allows Locke all that he wants in his theory of knowledge. He can have his\\n', 'general definition of knowledge that also “allow[s] these three degrees of Knowledge,\\n', '89 As will become clear, the further normative conditions are in addition to those requirements for the agreement in sensitive knowledge established in part II. The arguments for both psychological and\\n', 'normative conditions on knowledge are also found in Weinberg (2013).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'viz. Intuitive, Demonstrative, and Sensitive: in each of which there are different degrees\\n', 'and ways of Evidence and Certainty” (IV.ii.14).\\n', '\\n', 'Here, in part III, I will argue that Locke’s theory of knowledge includes both first-\\n', 'order psychological and second-order normative conditions. Having knowledge at all\\n', 'depends on whether the first-order psychological conditions are met, namely those\\n', 'conditions on the agreement constituting sensitive knowledge as established in part II.\\n', '\\n', 'The degree of certainty we have in the different forms of knowledge depends on how\\n', 'well each “degree” of knowledge (intuitive, demonstrative, and sensitive) meets\\n', 'further second-order (reflective) normative conditions. In advancing my case that\\n', 'sensitive knowledge is a form of non-inferential knowledge, I will draw out Locke’s\\n', 'own implicit analogy between intuitive and sensitive knowledge. By comparing both\\n', 'the similarities in the way in which each one meets the psychological conditions and\\n', 'the differences in the way in which they meet normative conditions, I can show why\\n', 'both sensitive and intuitive knowledge are the immediate (non-inferential) perception\\n', 'of an agreement of ideas, but at the same time they do not have the same certainty.\\n', '\\n', 'Unlike intuitive knowledge, sensitive knowledge does not meet a higher order nor-\\n', 'mative condition. Should I step back from my sensitive knowledge and reflectively ask\\n', 'whether I should still accept what I have just immediately perceived, I can generate a\\n', 'reason for doubt. Hence, sensitive knowledge has a lesser degree of certainty. But it is\\n', 'still knowledge—at least for Locke. Therefore, not all knowledge, for Locke, must meet\\n', 'the same epistemic conditions. The psychological condition, namely the perception of\\n', 'an agreement and the subjective certainty experienced therein, constitutes knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'But the degree of certainty of that knowledge depends upon whether (and how well)\\n', 'further epistemic conditions are met. I suggest that the similarities and differences in\\n', 'the degrees of knowledge and the ways in which they meet these conditions constitute\\n', 'Locke’s reply to the skeptical challenge. Although the bulk of the arguments address\\n', 'only intuitive and sensitive knowledge, I will also have something to say about why\\n', 'Locke’s understanding of demonstrative knowledge is consistent with the interpret-\\n', 'ation I put forward.\\n', '\\n', 'I have already provided ample textual reasons for attributing to Locke the view\\n', 'that sensitive knowledge counts as a species of knowledge. Let me reiterate some of\\n', 'the main ones here. First, Locke tells us, “We can have Knowledge no farther than we\\n', 'have Ideas” (IV.iii.1). Second, Locke “allow[s] these three degrees of Knowledge, viz.\\n', '\\n', 'Intuitive, Demonstrative, and Sensitive” (IV.ii.14). Third, sensitive knowledge is a\\n', 'species of the knowledge of “real existence” (IV.i.1, IV.iii.21). Fourth, Locke defines\\n', 'knowledge as “the perception of the connexion and agreement, or disagreement and\\n', 'repugnancy of any of our Ideas” (IV.i.2), and finally, “where-ever the Mind perceives\\n', 'the Agreement or Disagreement of any of its Ideas, there be certain Knowledge”\\n', '(IV.ii.2). These passages clearly indicate that a necessary and sufficient condition of\\n', 'knowledge (generally) is that there is the perception of an agreement of ideas, and\\n', 'that all knowledge is certain. Furthermore, in part II we saw that Locke’s definition of\\n', 'the agreement in sensitive knowledge can be reconciled with the general definition\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'of knowledge. So, Locke must be thinking that in a case of sensitive knowledge there\\n', 'is an agreement perceived, and it enjoys (at least some degree of) certainty.\\n', '\\n', 'What is more, I take Locke to be concerned to delimit what he counts as\\n', 'knowledge from what he considers probability. Locke describes his project as one\\n', 'of “search[ing] out the bounds between opinion and knowledge” (I.i.3). He states his\\n', 'purpose “to inquire into the original, certainty, and extent of human knowledge,\\n', 'together with the grounds and degrees of belief, opinion, and assent” (I.i.2). This\\n', 'mission in combination with the above textual statements about what knowledge in\\n', 'general and sensitive knowledge in particular consist in is good evidence that he\\n', 'considers sensitive knowledge to count as knowledge and not a degree of “belief,\\n', 'opinion, and assent.” My concern, now, is only with why, once sensitive knowledge is\\n', 'seen as knowledge, Locke responds to the skeptical challenge as he does. Part III offers\\n', 'a way to understand Locke’s treatment of the skeptical question, given that all\\n', 'knowledge, including sensitive knowledge, is internal to ideas. In addition, the\\n', 'interpretation underscores Locke’s own description of his task, not to show that we\\n', 'can know all that we may want to know, but rather to show that human understand-\\n', 'ing can provide knowledge sufficient for what we need to know.\\n', '\\n', '3.III.1 Locke’s Epistemic Task\\n', 'To provide an appropriate frame for the interpretation I am advancing, it is helpful to\\n', 'think about the nature of what I am calling Locke’s “epistemic task” in the Essay. In\\n', 'the “Epistle to the Reader,” Locke relates the birth of the Essay. As he tells it, he was\\n', 'discussing matters of important concern with several friends when they came to the\\n', 'realization that they were unable to reach satisfactory solutions. Locke says,\\n', 'After we had a while puzzled our selves, without coming any nearer a resolution of those Doubts\\n', 'which perplexed us, it came to my thoughts that we took a wrong course; and that, before we set\\n', 'our selves upon Enquiries of that Nature, it was necessary to examine our own Abilities, and see,\\n', 'what Objects our Understandings were, or were not fitted to deal with. (Locke 1975: 7)\\n', 'According to the testimony of his contemporary, James Tyrrell, Locke and his friends\\n', 'were discussing matters of morality and revealed religion.90 Locke wanted to know\\n', 'whether the understanding is “fitted to deal with” important issues concerning our\\n', 'knowledge of God and how we ought to live. Are we fit to achieve the practical goals\\n', 'of happiness in this life and the next? Locke’s answer, after all the subsequent hard\\n', 'work in the Essay, is that although there are a number of things we cannot know,\\n', 'such as the nature of substance, the full mechanistic account of nature, and whether\\n', 'thinking substance is material or immaterial, we can know enough to make our way\\n', 'through those puzzling issues that most concern us:\\n', '90 This claim seems uncontroversial. See Cranston (1957), Colman (1983: ch. 1), Wolterstorff (1996: 1), Jolley (1999: 3), and Woolhouse (2007: 98).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'For though the Comprehension of our Understandings, comes exceeding short of the vast\\n', 'Extent of Things; yet, we shall have Cause enough to magnify the bountiful Author of our\\n', 'Being, for that Portion and degree of Knowledge, he has bestowed on us, so far above all the\\n', 'rest of the Inhabitants of this our Mansion.

But sensitive\\n', 'knowledge also shares more general psychological features with all forms of intuitive\\n', 'knowledge, even those general truths in which we know propositions as the result of\\n', 'voluntarily comparing ideas. Three other important similarities emerge between\\n', 'intuitive knowledge generally and sensitive knowledge. First, all intuitive knowledge,\\n', 'like sensitive knowledge, is immediate both logically and temporally. Second, both\\n', 'intuitive and sensitive knowledge are irresistible and unavoidable. And third, Locke\\n', 'seems to think that both resist what he calls an “earnest” skeptical attitude.\\n', '\\n', 'Establishing the analogy between intuitive and sensitive knowledge serves three\\n', 'purposes. First, it yields further support for the arguments in part I of this chapter by\\n', 'showing that having intuitive knowledge internal to the perception of an idea is\\n', 'consistent with other features common to all cases of intuitive knowledge. Second, it\\n', 'strengthens my arguments in parts I and II by showing that the structural similarity\\n', 'in knowing the agreement in the intuitive knowledge of my own ideas and my own\\n', 'existence, and in an instance of sensitive knowledge, is consistent with other\\n', 'psychological features similar to both intuitive and sensitive knowledge. Third,\\n', 'explicating the additional shared psychological features of intuitive and sensitive\\n', 'knowledge is helpful in distinguishing their dissimilarities, namely answering the\\n', 'crucial question how two forms of non-inferential knowledge can differ in degree\\n', 'of certainty.\\n', '\\n', 'Let us move on to the analogy. Consider first Locke’s description of the immediacy\\n', 'of intuitive knowledge.91 First, knowing the identity of an idea (as we saw in part I) is\\n', '91 Remember that Locke’s use of the term “immediately” to describe the way in which agreements can\\n', 'be known is not meant to carry the more contemporary meaning of “direct perceptual access” or\\n', '“unmediated” by an idea. As noted previously, Locke states elsewhere that “the Mind, in all its Thoughts and Reasonings, hath no other immediate Object, but its own ideas” (IV.i.1) and also that “the Mind knows not Things immediately, but only by the intervention of the Ideas it has of them” (IV.iv.3). So, “immediacy,” for Locke, does not mean that we have knowledge beyond our ideas (IV.iii.1).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'an immediate form of knowledge: “A Man infallibly knows, as soon as ever he has\\n', 'them in his Mind that the Ideas he calls White and Round, are the Ideas they are”\\n', '(IV.i.4). This knowledge is internal to the perception of the idea. But also when Locke\\n', 'explains the nature of intuitive knowledge more generally, he states that we perceive\\n', 'the agreement or disagreement of ideas “immediately by themselves, without the\\n', 'intervention of any other.” Thus, we perceive\\n', 'that White is not Black, That a Circle is not a Triangle, That Three are more than Two, and\\n', 'equal to One and Two. Such kind of Truths the mind perceives at the first sight of the Ideas\\n', 'together, by bare Intuition, without the intervention of any other Idea; and this kind of\\n', 'Knowledge is the clearest, and most certain, that humane Frailty is capable of.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ii.1)\\n', 'Locke seems to be speaking of the “immediacy” of intuitive knowledge in two ways.\\n', '\\n', 'First, there is logical immediacy in the sense that no other ideas than those originally\\n', 'perceived (or compared) are necessary to know the agreement.92 Indeed, Locke specific-\\n', 'ally uses the term “immediately” to distinguish this difference between intuitive and\\n', 'demonstrative knowledge. In demonstrative knowledge, “the Mind perceives the Agree-\\n', 'ment or Disagreement of any Ideas, but not immediately” (IV.ii.2). Demonstrative\\n', 'knowledge, for Locke, is knowledge by proofs, which requires intervening ideas to show\\n', 'the agreement or disagreement of any ideas. “Those intervening Ideas, which serve to\\n', 'shew the Agreement of any two others, are called Proofs; and where the Agreement or\\n', 'Disagreement is by this means plainly and clearly perceived, it is called Demonstration”\\n', '(IV.ii.3).93 I suggest that we see logical immediacy as a feature of intuitive knowledge\\n', 'generally that distinguishes it from demonstrative knowledge, but not from sensitive\\n', 'knowledge. Therefore, that all intuitive and sensitive knowledge can be seen to share\\n', 'certain features, for example logical immediacy, does not mean that we cannot within\\n', 'Locke’s theory of knowledge distinguish them insofar as they do not share other features.\\n', '\\n', 'Indeed, I will argue that how well intuitive and sensitive knowledge (as well as demon-\\n', 'strative knowledge) stand up to a reflective challenge is one such distinguishing feature.\\n', '\\n', 'Second, Locke also seems to think all intuitive knowledge is temporally immediate in\\n', 'the sense that there is no temporal gap between perceiving the ideas and perceiving any\\n', 'agreement or disagreement therein.94 We see this in Locke’s use of temporal terms like\\n', '“as soon as ever” he has ideas in the mind he has knowledge, “whilst” having an idea we\\n', '92 I have defined logical immediacy in this way in order to rule out cases in which the agreement is part of a more complex argument or proof, which we would naturally want to count as a case of demonstration rather than intuition.\\n', '\\n', '93 Remember also “in every step Reason makes in demonstrative Knowledge, there is an intuitive\\n', 'Knowledge of that Agreement or Disagreement” (IV.ii.7).\\n', '\\n', '94 For Locke, remember, the understanding just is the power of perception (II.vi.2). Of course, one would want to distinguish the perception in judging as the “presumption” of an agreement of ideas from the perception in “knowing” an agreement of ideas. But Locke is not always as precise as we would like him to be. For example, we see Locke using “perception” in IV.ii.6 to refer to cases both of knowing and of not knowing. It is also controversial whether his use of “judgment” (as a kind of perception) in II.ix.8 is consistent with his use of it in IV.xiv–xv.

Moreover, these two kinds of immediacy seem, for Locke, related.\\n', '\\n', 'The reason why a form of knowledge is instantaneously self-evident derives from the\\n', 'fact that I know the agreement as a part of perceiving ideas themselves as compared or\\n', 'juxtaposed in the understanding. For example, when I perceive an idea of white and\\n', 'I perceive (compare) an idea of black, logically, I have an immediate knowledge of their\\n', 'disagreement, since I can perceive it without the need for any intervening ideas. What\\n', 'we find in IV.ii.5 provides a good illustration. Here, Locke says, “And so if the Mind\\n', 'have the Faculty of distinct Perception, it will perceive the Agreement or Disagreement\\n', 'of Ideas that produce intuitive Knowledge.” Distinct perception is not enough in cases\\n', 'where the agreement cannot be perceived immediately. Locke says:\\n', 'Thus having the Ideas of an obtuse, and an acute Triangle, both drawn from equal Bases, and\\n', 'between Parallels, I can by intuitive Knowledge, perceive the one not to be the other; but\\n', 'cannot that way know, whether they be equal, or no; because their Agreement, or Disagree-\\n', 'ment in equality, can never be perceived by an immediate comparing them: The difference of\\n', 'Figure makes their parts uncapable of an exact immediate application; and therefore there is\\n', 'need of some intervening Quantities to measure them by, which is Demonstration, or rational\\n', 'Knowledge.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.iii.3)\\n', 'Moreover, when I perceive those ideas together I know instantaneously—“at first\\n', 'sight”—that, for example, “white is not black.”\\n', 'Consider also, again, this passage in which Locke describes our intuitive know-\\n', 'ledge of our own ideas:\\n', '’Tis the first Act of the Mind, when it has any Sentiments or Ideas at all, to perceive its Ideas,\\n', 'and so far as it perceives them, to know each what it is, and thereby also to perceive their\\n', 'difference, and that one is not another. This is so absolutely necessary, that without it there\\n', 'could be no knowledge, no Reasoning, no Imagination, no distinct Thoughts at all. By this the\\n', 'Mind clearly and infallibly perceives each Idea to agree with it self, and not to be the other: and it does this without any pains, labour, or deduction; but at first view, by its natural power of\\n', 'Perception and Distinction. . . . A Man infallibly knows, as soon as ever he has them in his\\n', 'Mind that the Ideas he calls White and Round, are the Ideas they are, and that they are not\\n', 'other Ideas which he calls Red or Square.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.i.4)\\n', 'Here Locke says that when I have a distinct idea, insofar as I perceive that idea,\\n', 'I know what it is, solely by the mind’s natural power of “Perception and Distinction.”\\n', 'As argued in part I, insofar as I perceive any idea distinctly, I know “what it is.” I need\\n', 'not worry that when I perceive the idea “white” or the idea “black” I actually have\\n', 'some other ideas in my mind, say the idea “red” or the idea “round.” Whenever\\n', 'I perceive the idea “white,” I just know “clearly and infallibly” “without any pains,\\n', 'labour, or deduction; but at first view” that I really am perceiving the idea “white.”\\n', 'The intuitive knowledge is described as both logically and temporally immediate.\\n', '\\n', 'Notice the similarity in Locke’s description of intuitive knowledge as the result of\\n', 'comparing ideas in this next passage. Again, the mind’s natural power of “distinct\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'perception” is operative in the logical and temporal immediacy of intuitive know-\\n', 'ledge. As long as this mental faculty is working properly, Locke says we will intuit the\\n', 'appropriate agreement “at first glimpse, without hesitation”:\\n', 'Another difference between intuitive and demonstrative Knowledge, is, that though in the latter all doubt be removed, when by the Intervention of the intermediate Ideas, the Agreement or\\n', 'Disagreement is perceived; yet before the Demonstration there was a doubt, which in intuitive\\n', 'Knowledge cannot happen to the Mind that has its Faculty of Perception left to a degree capable of\\n', 'distinct Ideas, no more than it can be a doubt to the Eye, (that can distinctly see White and Black,) whether this Ink, and this Paper be all of a Colour. If there be Sight in the Eyes, it will at first glimpse, without Hesitation, perceive the Words printed on this Paper, different from the Colour\\n', 'of the Paper: And so if the Mind have the Faculty of distinct Perception, it will perceive the\\n', 'Agreement or Disagreement of those Ideas that produce intuitive Knowledge. If the Eyes have lost\\n', 'the Faculty of seeing, or the Mind of perceiving, we in vain inquire after the quickness of Sight in one, or clearness of Perception in the other.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ii.5)\\n', 'I take Locke to be saying that part of the temporal dimension involved in knowing\\n', 'demonstrative agreements is that the comparison of the ideas itself does not instant-\\n', 'aneously result in knowing the agreement as it does in intuitive knowledge. Just as\\n', 'when we see the ink of the printed words juxtaposed with the color of the paper, there\\n', 'is no “hesitation” in perceiving that “the words printed on this paper [are] different\\n', 'from the color of the paper,” when we compare any two ideas minimally necessary to\\n', 'show the agreement, we will equally, without hesitation, “at first view” know that\\n', 'agreement. If nothing else is needed to perceive the agreement, if the idea or ideas are\\n', 'perceived (that is, they appear in the Mind such that the agreement can be perceived),\\n', 'and if the mind’s faculty of perception is functioning properly, then we will with the\\n', 'same “quickness of sight” perceive the agreement. This is no more than to reiterate\\n', 'and provide more textual evidence for Locke’s “one-act” theory of knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'Therefore, we should see intuitive knowledge generally as having both logical and\\n', 'temporal immediacy: It involves neither an intervening idea to show the agreement,\\n', 'nor is the knowledge temporally distinguishable from the mental act involved in\\n', 'perceiving the ideas.\\n', '\\n', 'The description of intuitive knowledge as logically and temporally immediate is\\n', 'also found in Locke’s version of the cogito argument. Consider again this passage, to\\n', 'which I gave considerable focus in part I. He says, “In every Act of Sensation,\\n', 'Reasoning, or Thinking, we are conscious to our selves of our own Being; and, in\\n', 'this Matter, come not short of the highest degree of Certainty” (IV.ix.3). Locke is here\\n', 'stating that we have intuitive knowledge of our own real existence as a component of\\n', 'any perception, thinking, or what is equivalent, having ideas.95 For Locke, there is\\n', '95 Locke considers perceiving, thinking, and having ideas equivalent: “To ask, at what time a Man first has any Ideas, is to ask, when he begins to perceive; having Ideas, and Perception being the same thing”\\n', '(II.i.9). And in II.vi.2, Locke equates the power of thinking with the power of perception. See, again, also II.xiv.3.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'nothing more than what is involved in a perception of the understanding, which is\\n', 'part and parcel with the knowledge it includes. “For in this [intuitive knowledge], the\\n', 'Mind is at no pains of proving or examining, but perceives the Truth, as the Eye doth\\n', 'light, only by being directed toward it” (IV.ii.1). When I perceive the idea, in that\\n', 'moment, I just know the agreement.\\n', '\\n', 'Locke continues that intuitive knowledge is “irresistible” and “like the bright Sun-\\n', 'shine, forces it self immediately to be perceived, as soon as ever the Mind turns its\\n', 'view that way; and leaves no room for Hesitation, Doubt, or Examination, but the\\n', 'Mind is presently filled with the clear Light of it” (IV.ii.1). Locke seems to be saying\\n', 'that as soon as we are aware of the ideas in our minds we perceive the agreement;\\n', 'intuitive knowledge is “irresistible” to us. It leaves “no room for Doubt or Hesita-\\n', 'tion.” In the moment of perceiving the agreement we cannot but accept what we\\n', 'perceive: the knowledge is unavoidable. So, just as the brightness of the sun is\\n', 'irresistible to our sight, which means that we cannot but perceive the brightness of\\n', 'the sun in the moment we look at the sun, we cannot but perceive and accept as true\\n', 'those particular agreements when we perceive (look at) those ideas—when they are\\n', 'presented to us in consciousness. Intuitively (non-inferentially) perceived agree-\\n', 'ments, therefore, have the second analogous feature. They are “irresistible” and\\n', 'unavoidable; they are in a sense forced on us.96 We are “filled with the clear Light”\\n', 'of the knowledge upon perceiving the ideas.\\n', '\\n', 'Finally, we come to the third analogous feature. Locke tells us that the intuitive\\n', 'knowledge of the identity (and diversity) of our own ideas, which is of the highest\\n', 'certainty, resists a skeptical attitude:\\n', '’Tis on this Intuition, that depends all the certainty and Evidence of our knowledge, which\\n', 'Certainty every one finds to be so great, that he cannot imagine, and therefore not require a\\n', 'greater: For a Man cannot conceive himself capable of a greater Certainty, than to know that\\n', 'any Idea in his Mind is such as he perceives it to be; and that two Ideas, wherein he perceives a\\n', 'difference, are different, and not precisely the same. He that demands a greater Certainty than\\n', 'this, demands he knows not what, and shews only that he has a Mind to be a Sceptick, without\\n', 'being able to be so.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ii.1)\\n', 'The certainty of my intuitive knowledge is derived from the infallibility of the\\n', 'intuition. It makes sense, then, that Locke ends the passage with the claim that\\n', 'I cannot genuinely doubt my intuitive knowledge. I cannot in good faith doubt\\n', 'what is so very clear to me. As Locke puts it, to doubt my intuitive knowledge\\n', 'shows only that I have “a Mind to be a Sceptick, without being able to be so.” I read\\n', 'this point to be that as hard as I might try to adopt a skeptical stance toward my own\\n', 'intuitive knowledge, I cannot rid myself of the certainty I immediately experience\\n', 'whenever I perceive the agreements of those ideas. Furthermore, the certainty of\\n', '96 Locke describes “perception” as by and large a passive operation. “For in bare naked Perception, the Mind is, for the most part, only passive, and what it perceives it cannot avoid perceiving” (II.ix.1).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'intuitive knowledge is reinforced—I have the same certainty—each time I step back to\\n', 'consider whether what I take to be intuitive knowledge really is intuitive knowledge,\\n', 'namely that “a Circle is not a Triangle, that Three are more than Two, and equal to One\\n', 'and Two” (IV.ii.1). At no time does it seem natural to doubt the certainty of my\\n', 'perception of the idea “white”—that it is as I am perceiving it to be—or that when\\n', 'I perceive the idea “white” and the idea “black”, they are different. To take a skeptical\\n', 'stance toward what is so very certain to me, and even reinforced to me with each\\n', 'reflective challenge, as we have it in Locke’s model of the mind, would be to adopt an\\n', 'attitude to my own experience of which I am “incapable.” So, Locke’s lack of concern\\n', 'for skepticism with respect to intuitive knowledge is not evidence that he ignores the\\n', 'problem, but rather reveals his conviction that when it comes to the nature of these\\n', 'kinds of agreements we cannot get ourselves into a perceptual situation in which the\\n', 'skeptical challenge has any purchase on us.97\\n', '3.III.3 The Similarity of Intuitive and Sensitive\\n', 'Knowledge: The Case for Sensitive Knowledge\\n', 'Let us turn now to Locke’s discussion of sensitive knowledge to see additional ways in\\n', 'which it is analogous to intuitive knowledge. To provide more evidence why we\\n', 'should see sensitive knowledge as a form of non-inferential knowledge and to elicit\\n', 'the two cognitive standpoints essential to differentiating the three degrees of\\n', 'certainty of knowledge, we are looking to establish the same three features in sensitive\\n', 'knowledge: (1) it is immediate in both the logical and temporal senses; (2) it is\\n', 'irresistible, or unavoidable; and (3) it resists a skeptical attitude. I will consider the\\n', 'first two in this section. The third, I will treat in section 3.III.4.\\n', '\\n', 'Before considering the analogy proper, it is helpful to have in mind the following\\n', 'two points. First, like intuitive and demonstrative knowledge, sensitive knowledge has a\\n', 'degree of certainty that comes with any instance of knowledge. Locke says, “where-ever\\n', 'the Mind perceives the Agreement or Disagreement of any of its Ideas, there be certain\\n', 'knowledge” (IV.ii.2). The agreement perceived in an instance of sensitive knowledge is\\n', 'the agreement of “real existence” with respect to “particular finite beings without us”\\n', '(IV.xi.3, IV.ii.14). This means that Locke does not understand sensitive knowledge as a\\n', 'form of probable judgment. In probable judgment, “the Mind takes its Ideas to agree,\\n', 'or disagree . . . without perceiving a demonstrative Evidence in the Proofs” (IV.xiv.3).\\n', '\\n', 'Probable judgment is not the perception of an agreement, but taking there to be one\\n', 'when one is not perceived.98 In addition to the textual evidence on this point, note that\\n', '97 We will see that when it comes to sensitive knowledge this claim will be more nuanced with respect to which skeptical question is asked—whether we can have knowledge of things outside of us or whether we can have inferential knowledge of things outside of us.\\n', '\\n', '98 See also IV.xiv.4: “Judgment, which is the putting Ideas together, or separating them from one\\n', 'another in the Mind, when their certain agreement or disagreement is not perceived, but presumed to be so; which is as the Word imports, taken to be so before it certainly appears.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'were Locke to consider sensitive knowledge mere probable judgment, there would be\\n', 'no reason for him to assign it a middle degree of certainty falling somewhere between\\n', 'demonstrative knowledge and probability. It would have the degree of certainty of an\\n', 'agreement perceived either intuitively or demonstratively, or a degree of assent due a\\n', 'probable judgment, but not one, as Locke claims, falling somewhere in between. Yet,\\n', 'Locke states clearly not only that sensitive knowledge attains a degree of certainty, but\\n', 'also that “going beyond bare probability, and yet not reaching to either of the foregoing\\n', '[intuitive and demonstrative] degrees of certainty, [it] passes under the name of\\n', 'knowledge” (IV.ii.14). Therefore, Locke’s account of sensitive knowledge should not\\n', 'be seen as reducible to probable judgment.\\n', '\\n', 'I am sensitive to the concern that the IV.ii.14 passage just quoted need not be read as\\n', 'I interpret it. Rather, although called “knowledge” by Locke, perhaps sensitive know-\\n', 'ledge is better seen as a very high degree of probability falling between “bare probabil-\\n', 'ity” and intuitive and demonstrative knowledge. Rickless (2008) argues that not all true\\n', 'propositions are candidates for knowledge. Thus, Locke’s definition of knowledge as\\n', '“the perception of an agreement or disagreement of ideas” is reconcilable with an\\n', 'account in which what Locke calls the certainty of sensitive knowledge amounts to\\n', '“what Locke calls ‘assurance’—founded in the highest possible degree of probability”\\n', '(2008: 85), where “‘assurance’ is used in a very specific, technical sense” (2008: 92).\\n', '\\n', 'I think Rickless argues forcefully that Locke can be read this way. I disagree, however,\\n', 'that the textual evidence Rickless cites is conclusive, for there is other textual evidence\\n', 'that seems to be in conflict with the view that “assurance” or even “greatest” or “full\\n', 'assurance” is a technical term for the highest degree of probability. For example, in\\n', 'IV.ii.6, Locke uses “full assurance” to describe the certainty of intuitive knowledge: “’Tis\\n', 'true, the Perception, produced by Demonstration, is also very clear; yet it is often with a\\n', 'great abatement of that evident lustre and full assurance, that always accompany that\\n', 'which I call intuitive.” In II.xxxii.6, Locke uses “assurance” as the degree of certainty we\\n', 'have that the truth of relations between general ideas holds in all instances: “therefore, to\\n', 'shorten its way to knowledge, and make each perception more comprehensive, the first\\n', 'thing it does, as the foundation of the easier enlarging its knowledge . . . , is to bind them\\n', 'into bundles, and rank them so into sorts, that what knowledge it gets of any of them it\\n', 'may thereby with assurance extend to all of that sort.” And in IV.viii.3 we find\\n', '“assurance” equated with “infallibly know”:\\n', 'Let a man abound, as much as the plenty of words which he has will permit, in such\\n', 'propositions as these: “a law is a law,” and “obligation is obligation”; “right is right,” and\\n', '“wrong is wrong”: will these and the like ever help him to an acquaintance with ethics, or\\n', 'instruct him or others in the knowledge of morality? Those who know not, nor perhaps ever\\n', 'will know, what is right and what is wrong, nor the measures of them, can with as much\\n', 'assurance make, and infallibly know, the truth of these and all such propositions, as he that is\\n', 'best instructed in morality can do. But what advance do such propositions give in the\\n', 'knowledge of anything necessary or useful for their conduct?\\n', '\\n', '(IV.viii.3)\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'Finally, in this next passage, Locke tells us that the “greatest assurance” comes from\\n', 'intuition and demonstration:\\n', 'In propositions, then, whose certainty is built upon the clear perception of the agreement or\\n', 'disagreement of our ideas, attained either by immediate intuition, as in self-evident proposi-\\n', 'tions, or by evident deductions of reason in demonstrations we need not the assistance of\\n', 'revelation, as necessary to gain our assent, and introduce them into our minds. Because the\\n', 'natural ways of knowledge could settle them there, or had done it already; which is the greatest\\n', 'assurance we can possibly have of anything.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.xviii.5)\\n', 'In addition to Locke’s uses of “assurance” to refer to the subjective certainty we have\\n', 'in both intuitive and demonstrative knowledge, he also uses it to denote any degree of\\n', 'assent to a proposition. When talking about the degree to which any “rational\\n', 'Creature” is “a lover of Truth” Locke says,\\n', '[T]here are very few lovers of Truth for Truth’s sake, even amongst those, who perswade\\n', 'themselves that they are so. How a Man may know whether he be so in earnest is worth\\n', 'enquiry: And I think there is one unerring Mark of it, viz. The not entertaining any Proposition\\n', 'with greater assurance than the Proofs it is built upon will warrant.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.19.1)\\n', 'That Locke uses “assurance” to denote any degree of assent to a proposition, indeed,\\n', 'even only a degree of subjective confidence that is less than rational, undercuts the\\n', 'further objection that, in spite of the conflicting texts, Rickless has the best reading of\\n', '“assurance.”99 Therefore, we should see sensitive knowledge as having a degree of\\n', 'certainty that comes with any form of knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'Second, Locke asserts an explicit analogy of intuitive to sensitive knowledge in\\n', 'II.xxiii.15: “For whilst I know, by seeing or hearing, etc. that there is some Corporeal\\n', 'Being without me, the Object of that sensation, I do more certainly know, that there is\\n', 'some Spiritual Being within me, that sees and hears.” Locke clearly seems to be saying\\n', 'that intuitively perceived agreements are quite like sensitively perceived ones. Just as\\n', 'I know that I exist when I am perceiving any idea, I know that there exists a corporeal\\n', 'being when I have an occurrent idea of sensation. Note that in Locke’s own analogy\\n', 'between knowing that “there is some Corporeal Being without me,” a case of sensitive\\n', 'knowledge, and knowing that “there is some Spiritual being within me,” a case of\\n', 'intuitive knowledge, both count as knowledge. Yet, he clarifies, “I do more certainly\\n', 'know” what I know intuitively than what I know sensitively. This lends support to my\\n', 'claim that Locke’s commitments are much better served by first classifying knowledge\\n', 'as either non-inferential or inferential and then applying other conditions to determine\\n', 'the different degrees of certainty. Once I have established that sensitive knowledge, like\\n', 'intuitive knowledge, is logically and temporally immediate, is irresistible, and resists a\\n', 'skeptical attitude, I will provide another argument why sensitive knowledge, although\\n', 'psychologically akin to intuitive knowledge, is not the same as intuitive knowledge: It is,\\n', '99 See also I.i.2. Rockwood (2013: 19–24) offers more arguments against Rickless’s (forthcoming)\\n', 'attempt to defend this and other arguments in Rickless (2008).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'as Locke claims, less certain than intuitive knowledge. Let us turn now to the analogy\\n', 'between sensitive and intuitive knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter ii of Book IV is entitled Of the Degrees of our Knowledge. In the IV.ii.14\\n', 'analysis of the degree of certainty of sensitive knowledge, Locke states that sensitive\\n', 'knowledge begins with the perception of an idea of an external object. He then\\n', 'considers the skeptical problem. He says that many go on to question whether in fact\\n', 'we should infer that the idea we know intuitively to be in the mind corresponds to an\\n', 'actual object existing outside of us:\\n', 'But whether there be any thing more certain than barely that Idea in our Minds, whether we\\n', 'can thence certainly infer the existence of any thing without us, which corresponds to that Idea,\\n', 'is that, whereof some Men think there may be a question made, because Men may have such\\n', 'Ideas in their Minds, when no such thing exists, no such Object affects their Senses.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ii.14)\\n', 'In this passage, Locke confirms the skeptical concern as traditionally conceived: With\\n', 'just an idea of an external object in our minds “can we thence infer the existence of\\n', 'any thing without us, which corresponds to that Idea” (my emphasis in bold).\\n', '\\n', 'Traditionally, the question concerning sensitive knowledge is whether our particular\\n', 'ideas of sensation give us enough reason to conclude the existence of an external\\n', 'world? Are we normatively entitled to the inference?\\n', '\\n', 'I have already argued that Locke answers this question in the rest of IV.ii.14 when\\n', 'he considers what he calls the “evidence” for sensitive knowledge—what, he says,\\n', '“puts us past doubting.” Being conscious of the idea of an external object as from\\n', 'sensation is a condition on having sensitive knowledge. But the point I am arguing\\n', 'here is slightly different. Here I am arguing that Locke himself is drawing a similarity\\n', 'between the ways in which we intuitively and sensitively perceive agreements. He\\n', 'addresses the skeptical question posed in the preceding passage by saying that when\\n', 'we have ideas of external objects as the result of being affected through the senses, we\\n', 'do indeed have enough evidence in the perception of the idea itself (without needing\\n', 'anything else) to put us past doubting that there really exists something external to us\\n', 'producing our ideas. I repeat here the passage cited earlier in part II:\\n', 'But yet here, I think, we are provided with an Evidence that puts us past doubting: For I ask any\\n', 'one, Whether he be not invincibly conscious to himself of a different Perception, when he\\n', 'looks on the Sun by day, and thinks on it by night; when he actually tastes Wormwood, or\\n', 'smells a Rose, or only thinks on that Savour, or Odour. We as plainly find the difference there\\n', 'is between any Idea revived in our Minds by our own Memory, and actually coming into our\\n', 'Minds by our Senses, as we do between any two distinct Ideas.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ii.14)\\n', 'As a part of perceiving either an occurrent sensory idea or a memory we are\\n', '“invincibly conscious” to ourselves of the source of the idea.100 We can just tell\\n', '100 Although one might want to consider this kind of evidence weak, since it has to do with the quality of ideas, I suggest that Locke does not. One difference he sees between intuitive and demonstrative knowledge is that in intuitive knowledge “all doubt is removed,” while in demonstrative knowledge “before the Demonstration there was a doubt” (IV.ii.5). Locke seems to be saying that once an agreement is\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'that we are sensing rather than, say, remembering. But then he says, we as “plainly\\n', 'find” the difference in our experience “as we do between any two distinct Ideas.” Note\\n', 'that Locke is stating relatively clearly that the immediacy and certainty of our\\n', 'knowledge that the perception of an idea of the sun is due to sensation rather than\\n', 'due to memory is the same as the immediacy and certainty with which we know\\n', 'intuitively that two ideas are distinct. That is, it is just as immediately (in both the\\n', 'logical and temporal senses) certain to me that my perception of the idea of the sun is\\n', 'from sensation when I am looking at the sun, as it is immediately certain to me that\\n', 'any two ideas are different. Locke seems to be arguing that sensitive knowledge, like\\n', 'intuitive knowledge, is both logically and temporally immediate; it is non-inferential.\\n', '\\n', 'Moreover, that sensitive knowledge is both logically and temporally immediate\\n', 'implies that it is at the same time irresistible, or psychologically unavoidable. When\\n', 'we are in the right perceptual situation, that is, when the conditions are right to\\n', 'perceive the agreement (our complex mental state includes the perception of an\\n', 'occurrent real and adequate idea as of an external object, which also includes an\\n', 'awareness of the idea as from sensation), we cannot avoid knowing and accepting\\n', 'it.101 Hence, we have the first and second analogous features: sensitive knowledge is\\n', 'immediate and irresistible.\\n', '\\n', 'Because sensitive knowledge shares the two aforementioned features with intuitive\\n', 'knowledge, I suggest that we interpret Locke’s response to the skeptical concern,\\n', 'namely whether we can infer that there exist objects external to us in the moment we\\n', 'are sensing them, to be that the question is moot. As traditionally conceived, the\\n', 'skeptical question is inappropriate for Locke’s account, because sensitive knowledge\\n', 'does not involve an inference at all: It is both logically and temporally immediate.\\n', '\\n', 'Sensitive knowledge is something we have instantaneously when we perceive ideas\\n', 'as the result of being occurrently affected through the senses. Therefore, we need\\n', 'not make an additional inference from our ideas to an external world. Locke’s\\n', 'perceived in demonstrative knowledge, we are “past doubt.” The same would be the case in sensitive\\n', 'knowledge. The “evidence” is given in the perception of the agreement.\\n', '\\n', '101 Does this mean that my account is in conflict with Locke’s II.ix.8 claim that in visual perception there is a judgment from the immediate simple ideas of sensation, say, an idea of a “flat Circle variously shadow’d” to a complex idea of a round globe? Owen (1999: 33, n 9) notes the same possible objection: “If\\n', '‘judgement’ here [in II.ix.8] were being used in precisely the same way as it is in the later chapters of Book IV, then this would be a case of visual perception being inferential. But the way Locke describes it, it seems more a matter of unconscious processing ‘by an habitual custom’ than conscious reasoning.” Indeed,\\n', 'Owen’s interpretation that the mind’s movement from the perception of a flat circle to a perception of a round globe is due to habit is confirmed by Locke in Of the Conduct of the Understanding. There he (1996/\\n', '1706: 219) warns against the “evil” of associating ideas that “have no natural cohesion.” He continues:\\n', '“This is for caution against this evil, before it be thoroughly riveted by custom in the understanding; but he that would cure it, when habit has established it, must nicely observe the very quick and almost\\n', 'imperceptible motions of the mind in its habitual actions. What I have said in another place about the change of the ideas of sense into those of judgment may be proof of this.” I take this to establish conclusively that Locke’s use of “judgment” in this section (II.ix.8) is not the same as we find in his understanding of judgment in IV.xiv–xv.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'response to the skeptical concern raised in IV.ii.14, therefore, is that we need not\\n', 'question, as some do, whether on the basis of our sense experiences we are entitled to\\n', 'infer the existence of external objects. The reason is that sensitive knowledge, like\\n', 'intuitive knowledge, is non-inferential. Both kinds of agreements are logically and\\n', 'temporally immediate, and both are psychologically unavoidable; that is, when we\\n', 'perceive the agreeing ideas we just know and are compelled to accept that the\\n', 'agreement obtains.102\\n', 'Given what I have argued, one might think my interpretation commits Locke to\\n', 'the view that a visual hallucination of a pink elephant would count as an instance of\\n', 'sensitive knowledge, for the hallucination would be experienced as having originated\\n', 'in sensation. Unfortunately, Locke’s treatment of the skeptical problem is concerned\\n', 'with only systematic error, such as we have if there is an evil demon or we are locked\\n', 'in a perpetual dream. As is duly discussed by Bolton (2004a, 2004b) and LoLordo\\n', '(2008), Locke does not pay sufficient attention to occasional perceptual error. There\\n', 'are, however, two things to say that alleviate having to saddle Locke with the view\\n', 'that hallucinations count as sensitive knowledge. First, Locke thinks that the collec-\\n', 'tions of ideas we experience as originating in the senses do actually exist together:\\n', 'In fine then, when our senses do actually convey into our Understandings any Idea, we cannot\\n', 'but be satisfied, that there doth something at that time really exist without us, which doth affect our Senses, and by them give notice of it self to our apprehensive Faculties, and actually\\n', 'produce that Idea, which we then perceive: and we cannot so far distrust their Testimony, as to\\n', 'doubt, that such Collections of simple Ideas, as we have observed by our Senses to be united\\n', 'together, do really exist together.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.xi.9)\\n', 'So, it seems that he would not countenance doubting that whatever we are experi-\\n', 'encing through the senses corresponds to something that is or can be experienced\\n', 'through the senses. That is, the collections of simple sensory ideas composing our\\n', 'ideas of external objects are real and adequate ideas.\\n', '\\n', 'Second, one reason why Locke might say this is that he can also be seen to think\\n', 'that just as there is an obvious conscious difference between ideas originating in\\n', 'sensation, memory, and, say, reflective mental states, there is a (perhaps even more\\n', 'fine-grained) difference in experience between regular sensory ideas and occasional\\n', 'hallucinations. For example, after having been slipped a hallucinogenic drug I may\\n', 'see a pink elephant (or Cartman, my black cat—the same one I interact with\\n', 'regularly) at the back of the room. I suggest that, for Locke, even though I am having\\n', 'a “visual” experience (an hallucination) of Cartman, it is not phenomenologically\\n', 'identical to a regular visual experience. Hallucinating is a different kind of mental act\\n', 'and so experienced differently. Locke is also clear that we are aware of all of our\\n', '102 As we will see shortly, having sensitive knowledge does not preclude the possibility that the causes of my sensory ideas are radically different from the way in which I experience them. Remember that this is a reply to the skeptic consistent with a representational theory of perception.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'mental operations, even if we have only “obscure Notions” (II.i.25), and I have\\n', 'argued (as have others) that there are very good reasons to think that this awareness\\n', 'is due to consciousness. Phenomenological theories of consciousness generally attri-\\n', 'bute a particular subjective character, or a certain phenomenal quality of “what it is\\n', 'like” to experience different kinds of perceptual states. So occasional hallucinations\\n', 'can be seen as distinguishable from normal sense experience.103\\n', 'Finally, although considered a systematic skeptical possibility, the analysis of the\\n', '“unknown faculty” in Descartes’s interpretation can be seen as making a similar\\n', 'point. Newman (1994: 496) has argued persuasively that Descartes accepts the view\\n', 'that we are aware of all of our mental activity: “For any faculty, known or unknown,\\n', 'in me, I am aware of when its operations occur.” Therefore, were the ideas originating\\n', 'in such a faculty, I would be conscious of it. Since Locke is also committed to the view\\n', 'that all thinking is conscious (II.i.19), I see no reason why he would argue differently.\\n', '\\n', 'Perhaps the point to underscore is that, for Locke, our experience in sensing, namely\\n', 'the perception of an agreement of ideas and the subjective certainty therein, is\\n', 'sufficient for sensitive knowledge as a form of non-inferential knowledge.104\\n', '3.III.4 The Difference in Degree of Certainty\\n', 'of Sensitive and Intuitive Knowledge\\n', 'Locke is quite clear that although sensitive knowledge is a species of knowledge, and\\n', '(as I have argued) the agreement is perceived non-inferentially, still it is not as certain\\n', 'as intuitive knowledge: “The notice we have by our Senses, of the existing of Things\\n', 'without us, though it be not altogether so certain, as our intuitive Knowledge, or the\\n', 'Deductions of our Reason, employ’d about the clear abstract Ideas of our own Minds;\\n', 'yet it is an assurance that deserves the name of Knowledge” (IV.xi.3). Problematically,\\n', 'the distinction concerning certainty seems unavailable, since on the foregoing\\n', '103 See, for example, Zahavi (2005: 119): “Every conscious state, be it a perception, an emotion, a recollection, or an abstract belief, has a certain subjective character, a certain phenomenal quality of “what it is like” to live through and undergo that state.” I am not claiming anachronistically that this is evidence that Locke held the view. I merely want to point out that such a view is not idiosyncratic.\\n', '\\n', '104 This does bring up the independent question whether Locke can consistently adhere to the mental transparency thesis, even though he obviously accepted it. To return to Locke’s II.ix.8 treatment of the\\n', '“Molyneux problem,” one might think, for example, that we are not conscious of the idea of the “flat Circle, variously Shadow’d” on our way to perceiving the idea of a round globe. I have argued, though, that being conscious of all that passes in the mind (as Locke states it in II.i.19) is not necessarily to have a full-fledged idea of all that passes in the mind. Moreover, about habitual movements of the mind Locke says, “Nor need we wonder, that this is done with so little notice, if we consider, how very quick the actions of the Mind are performed” (II.ix.10). I do not think this sort of psychological data is necessarily inconsistent with Locke’s acceptance that all thinking is conscious, especially when consciousness is interpreted as pre-reflective.\\n', '\\n', 'That is, I can be conscious that I am perceiving even when owing to “habitual custom” the object of my perception passes so quickly in the mind that I do not take full notice of it. Moreover, that the unity of consciousness is maintained in the mind’s movement from the idea of the flat circle to the idea of the round globe supports that we are conscious we are perceiving throughout the change in ideas.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'analysis sensitive and intuitive knowledge are seen to be equivalent. In both cases,\\n', 'when I perceive the agreement I am immediately and irresistibly certain—with no\\n', 'room for skeptical concern.\\n', '\\n', 'The difference between the degrees of certainty in sensitive and intuitive know-\\n', 'ledge, I suggest, has been masked by the fact that the analysis of knowledge presented\\n', 'thus far has focused on only the psychological conditions of knowledge: the percep-\\n', 'tion of an agreement and the subjective force of the certainty attending any percep-\\n', 'tion of agreement. In terms of meeting these conditions, both kinds of knowledge are\\n', 'the same and both strike us the same—we cannot but accept what we perceive when\\n', 'we perceive the agreement. Nevertheless, insists Locke, sensitive knowledge is less\\n', 'certain. As Locke says, there are “three degrees of Knowledge, viz. Intuitive, Demon-\\n', 'strative, and Sensitive: in each of which there are different degrees and ways of\\n', 'Evidence and Certainty” (IV.ii.14). Perceiving an agreement, for Locke, constitutes\\n', 'knowledge, and all knowledge is certain.105 But how certain the knowledge is—its\\n', 'degree of certainty—depends on additional factors, namely whether a further reflect-\\n', 'ive normative condition is met.106 I suggest that the fact that sensitive knowledge\\n', 'enjoys a degree of certainty does not mean that it is beyond any doubt; neither does\\n', 'its vulnerability to doubt mean that it does not have a degree of certainty. I propose\\n', 'that, for Locke, intuitive and sensitive knowledge have different degrees of certainty,\\n', 'because intuitive knowledge withstands a second-order normative consideration,\\n', 'while sensitive knowledge does not.107 Although our sensitive knowledge is not as\\n', 'certain as we initially thought it was, our intuitive knowledge maintains its\\n', 'certainty—or at least our intuitive knowledge is as certain as we are capable of\\n', 'knowing.\\n', '\\n', 'For example, if after I intuitively perceive that my idea “white” is as I perceive it to\\n', 'be, I were to step back and consider reflectively whether I should accept that\\n', 'conclusion, I would have the same experience of intuitively knowing the idea\\n', '“white” again. The same is true for my intuitive knowledge that “three are more\\n', 'than two” or that “I exist.” I have the same certainty with every consideration\\n', 'whether I should accept what I know in virtue of perceiving the agreement. For\\n', 'every time I reflect on my perception of the agreement, I perceive the agreement\\n', 'again. I cannot place myself in a perceptual situation in which I am not immediately\\n', 'and irresistibly certain that what I perceive is true. Therefore, my intuitive knowledge\\n', 'has what I will call “full epistemic warrant”: it meets the psychological conditions,\\n', '105 See, again, IV.ii.2: “Though where-ever the Mind perceives the Agreement or Disagreement of any of its Ideas, there be certain Knowledge.”\\n', '106 An instance of demonstrative knowledge would also consist in the perception of an agreement and the subjective certainty, therein. As will soon be clear, that it is inferential as opposed to non-inferential does not affect the degree of certainty, except insofar as the knowledge meets a further normative condition.\\n', '\\n', '107 This argument is consistent with a similar one by Ainslie (2003) in his analysis of Hume’s skepticism with regard to reason. As long as belief, or in Locke’s case the certainty of sensitive knowledge, is not something separate from the formation of the belief (or perception of agreement, for Locke), then the skeptic must drive her wedge between the belief and a reflective challenge to it.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'and in reflection I cannot generate a reason why I should not accept it. The\\n', 'perception of my own real existence as well as of identity and diversity or of any\\n', 'other intuitively perceived agreements is of the highest degree of certainty because it\\n', 'withstands a second-order normative challenge.\\n', '\\n', 'Our experience of sensitive knowledge, however, is much different. When we\\n', 'reflect on our sensitive knowledge, our perceptual situation changes. No longer are\\n', 'we perceiving an occurrent idea of sensation, and thus no longer are we perceiving an\\n', 'agreement constituting knowledge with the subjective force of the certainty therein.\\n', '\\n', 'With this shift in cognitive standpoint, there is also a shift in what we are aware of\\n', 'insofar as we perceive an agreement. What we are aware of now is not an idea as\\n', 'currently from sensation, but rather, perhaps, an idea as mental state. Therefore, once\\n', 'we step back from our initial certainty in sensitive knowledge and ask why we should\\n', 'accept what was just so very certain a moment ago, our own experience and\\n', 'observation provide a reason for doubt. After all, when we are not occurrently\\n', 'sensing, we can consider that we might be in a perpetual dream or, equivalently,\\n', 'the victims of an evil demon.108 Sensitive knowledge, therefore, lacks full epistemic\\n', 'warrant and so has a lesser degree of certainty.\\n', '\\n', 'Let me take a moment now to address a couple of questions that might arise. First,\\n', 'I have been asked whether this analysis of sensitive knowledge stands up to Locke’s\\n', 'claims concerning “habitual knowledge,” namely that sensitive knowledge is\\n', 'retained. It does. Habitual knowledge comes in two “degrees”: of such truths where\\n', 'we perceive the relation between ideas again, which is a case of intuitive knowledge,\\n', 'and of such truths where the mind “retains the Memory of the Conviction, without the\\n', 'Proofs” (IV.i.9). Although Locke’s discussion of the latter form of retained knowledge\\n', 'is concerned almost exclusively with demonstrative knowledge, he does at the very\\n', 'end assert, “But yet ’tis evident, the Author himself knows the Proposition to be true,\\n', 'remembering he once saw the connection of those Ideas [in a proof], as certainly as\\n', 'he knows such a Man wounded another, remembering that he saw him run through”\\n', '(IV.i.9). The objection would be that sensitive knowledge as interpreted above would\\n', 'not be retained in memory if it does not withstand a second-order consideration.\\n', '\\n', 'This is not the case, however, since Locke is talking about remembering the certainty\\n', 'with which we perceived the agreement, not perceiving the agreement again. In a case\\n', 'of retained sensitive knowledge, I can remember the certainty with which I initially\\n', 'perceived the agreement, but, nevertheless, I can take a second-order stance to that\\n', '108 My argument is not meant to preclude that we can be considering that we are the victims of an evil demon while we are occurrently sensing. In II.xix.3, Locke states that the mind can be directed towards ideas with various “degrees of Attention.” The mind can be so focused on some ideas “that it shuts out all other Thoughts, and takes no notice of the ordinary Impressions made on the Senses, which at another Season would produce very sensible Perceptions.” To ask how we are able to be occurrently sensing while we are entertaining the possibility of systematic deception is to ask Locke to provide details of how, more generally, ideas are bound together in the mind. But as was mentioned earlier, this is a problem neither peculiar to Locke, nor to sensitive knowledge, nor even to early modern theories of perception. See also Nagel (forthcoming).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'remembered sensitive knowledge to consider whether there is any room for doubt.\\n', '\\n', 'Then I would have to admit that it is possible that I am in a perpetual dream or\\n', 'deceived by an evil demon. As we have seen, that just is the difference in degree of\\n', 'certainty between sensitive knowledge and intuitive knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'Second, does my account put sensitive knowledge on a par with enthusiasm, since\\n', 'they meet the same psychological conditions of logical and temporal immediacy and\\n', 'the conviction of certainty? To see why they are not on par, think about intuitive\\n', 'knowledge, which is also logically and temporally immediate. Consider, for example,\\n', 'the intuitively known proposition “three is more than two.” It is one question\\n', 'whether that agreement has the highest degree of certainty. I have argued that if in\\n', 'reflection we cannot generate a doubt, then it does. It is an altogether different\\n', 'question whether God has directly revealed that truth to me or I have come to\\n', 'know it by way of Locke’s empiricist explanation (IV.xix.10). Locke says that the\\n', 'certainty of anything known by revelation is the degree of certainty we have that it\\n', 'actually is revelation, not the degree of certainty the perception of the agreement has\\n', 'on its own. Indeed, Locke is clear that “Faith can never convince us of any Thing, that\\n', 'contradicts our Knowledge” (IV.xviii.5). That is because our justification for faith is\\n', 'limited by our ability to have knowledge. So, to think that faith can outstrip\\n', 'knowledge is to “overturn all the Principles and Foundations of Knowledge [God]\\n', 'has given us; render all our Faculties useless; wholly destroy the most excellent Part of\\n', 'his Workmanship, our Understandings” (IV.xviii.5). Thus, if we can know some-\\n', 'thing by our own faculties, it does little to the glorification of God to claim that we\\n', 'know it by direct revelation and not by the use of those faculties. What, then, he asks,\\n', 'would be the point of giving us the faculties in the first place?\\n', '\\n', 'I suggest that a similar answer can be given with respect to why sensitive know-\\n', 'ledge is not equivalent to enthusiasm. The first thing to say is that the psychological\\n', 'conditions are not the same, for perceiving the agreement in an instance of sensitive\\n', 'knowledge includes the experience of the knowledge as having its source in sensation.\\n', '\\n', 'That is, even on the off chance that the source is an evil demon, I still have the\\n', 'experience of being affected through the senses. But again, if what I know by\\n', 'sensation can just as equally be claimed to be an instance of direct revelation, then\\n', 'why has God given us the faculty of sensation? I suggest that Locke is not so\\n', 'concerned with the objection, since he does not think knowledge, in any form, is\\n', 'over determined in this way. “It is hard,” he says, “to conceive how there can be a\\n', 'revelation to any one of what he knows already” (IV.xix.10). Furthermore, Locke’s\\n', 'main objection to enthusiasm is that it is the irrational acceptance of a belief. It is to\\n', 'place faith above reason: “He that believes, without having any Reason for believing,\\n', 'may be in love with his own Fancies; but neither seeks the Truth as he ought, nor pays\\n', 'the Obedience due his Maker, who would have him use those discerning Faculties he\\n', 'has given him, to keep him out of Mistake and Errour. . . . He that does otherwise,\\n', 'transgresses against his own Light, and misuses those Faculties, which were given\\n', 'him to no other end, but to search and follow the clearer Evidence, and greater\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'Probability” (IV.xvii.24). Sensitive knowledge is not the same as enthusiasm, since\\n', 'our experience that we are sensing does indeed give us a reason (even in reflection) to\\n', 'think that our ideas are the result of really existing things affecting our senses, albeit\\n', 'not a reason that withstands all doubt. Indeed, in describing what is meant by\\n', '“enthusiasm,” Locke says, “For strong conceit, like a new principle, carries all easily\\n', 'with it, when got above common sense, and freed from all restraint of reason and\\n', 'check of reflection, it is heightened into a divine authority, in concurrence with our\\n', 'own temper and inclination” (IV.xix.7). Thus, my interpretation has not put sensitive\\n', 'knowledge on par with enthusiasm.\\n', '\\n', 'Returning now to the role of psychological and normative conditions in establish-\\n', 'ing epistemic warrant and so degrees of certainty of knowledge, we can look again to\\n', 'Locke’s aim in the Essay. That task is to discover the limits of human understanding,\\n', 'that is, to show what we are justified in asserting, given the resources we have. Thus, he\\n', 'sees only intuitive knowledge as meeting the highest standard for certainty. Perhaps\\n', 'one reason Locke does not require a more rigid standard for knowledge is that he is\\n', 'not willing to seek justification for any source of knowledge—including the senses—\\n', 'outside of what human understanding can deliver on its own. In his introduction to\\n', 'the nature of the investigation undertaken in the Essay, Locke contrasts his conclu-\\n', 'sions with those of the skeptic:\\n', 'Thus Men, extending their Enquiries beyond their Capacities, and letting their Thoughts\\n', 'wander into those depths, where they can find no sure Footing; ’tis no Wonder, that they\\n', 'raise Questions, and multiply Disputes, which never coming into any clear Resolution, are\\n', 'proper only to continue and increase their Doubts, and to confirm them at last in perfect\\n', 'Scepticism. Whereas were the Capacities of our Understandings well considered, the Extent of\\n', 'our Knowledge once discovered, and the Horizon found, which sets the Bounds between the\\n', 'enlightened and dark Parts of Things; between what is and what is not comprehensible by us,\\n', 'Men would perhaps with less scruple acquiesce in the avow’d ignorance of the one, and imploy\\n', 'their Thoughts and Discourse, with more Advantage and Satisfaction in the other.\\n', '\\n', '(I.i.7)\\n', 'If we have reached the limits of justification, then it makes better sense to say that we\\n', 'have knowledge with at least some degree of certainty, rather than no knowledge at\\n', 'all, especially if Locke’s main task was to ground moral and pragmatic concerns\\n', 'rather than to pursue a “Universal, or perfect Comprehension of whatsoever is.”\\n', 'But if Locke is willing to rest with what our perceptual faculties can deliver of the\\n', 'external world on their own, and even call it knowledge, then why include a slew of\\n', 'probabilistic arguments in defense of it? I suggest that as long as we do not\\n', 'reflectively challenge the psychological experience of certainty in having sensitive\\n', 'knowledge, the probabilistic arguments do not come into play. Once, however, we\\n', 'trade psychological certainty in sensitive knowledge for a new standard by asking the\\n', 'traditional skeptical question “whether we can thence certainly infer the existence\\n', 'of anything without us” (IV.ii.14, my emphasis), we find ourselves in need of\\n', 'additional reasons to shore up the initial deliverances of our perceptual faculty. We\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'are asking whether our knowledge meets a further normative condition. Hence, we\\n', 'need additional justification.\\n', '\\n', 'We see Locke making this shift from the initial certainty of sensitive knowledge to\\n', 'the need for further warrant when he introduces the probabilistic arguments in\\n', 'IV.xi.3. He begins by affirming that we cannot doubt what is present to our senses:\\n', '“I think no body can, in earnest, be so skeptical, as to be uncertain of the Existence of\\n', 'those Things which he sees and feels” (IV.xi.3). This is a clear statement that sensitive\\n', 'knowledge enjoys certainty and that our sensitive knowledge can be no more certain\\n', 'to us when we are perceiving occurrent real and adequate ideas of sensation.\\n', '\\n', 'Nevertheless, Locke follows by offering additional justification should we reflect or\\n', 'evaluate the certainty of our sensitive knowledge: “besides the assurance we have\\n', 'from our Senses themselves, that they do not err in the Information they give us, of\\n', 'the Existence of Things without us, when they are affected by them, we are farther\\n', 'confirmed in this assurance, by other concurrent Reasons” (IV.xi.3). For example,\\n', 'those arguments include pointing to our ability to be affected by the senses (IV.xi.4),\\n', 'the passivity of the senses (IV.xi.5), the fact that a sense experience is often accom-\\n', 'panied by a pain, while a memory of the very same experience is not (IV.xi.6), and the\\n', 'fact that we have common agreement concerning our sense experiences (IV.xi.7).\\n', '\\n', 'Each of these probabilistic arguments is an attempt after the fact to meet the skeptical\\n', 'doubt. Each argument attempts to answer the question whether we ought to accept\\n', 'what we cannot but admit while we are perceiving ideas as the result of being\\n', 'occurrently affected through the senses.\\n', '\\n', 'The probabilistic arguments employed by Locke, therefore, are not addressed to\\n', 'the perception of the agreement of real existence (with respect to particular finite\\n', 'beings) and the certainty I experience in the moment of sensing, but to a second-\\n', 'order reflective challenge to the sufficiency of those conditions for the highest form of\\n', 'knowledge. Thus, it makes sense to interpret Locke as seeing the difference between\\n', 'the degrees of certainty of knowledge as the difference in the ability to withstand a\\n', 'challenge of this kind. My suggestion, therefore, is that these arguments address\\n', 'different tasks: grounding sensitive knowledge in psychological conditions due to the\\n', 'nature and experience of our own thinking and seeking to ground it in a second-\\n', 'order normative perspective we take to our own thinking and experience. The\\n', 'difference between intuitive and sensitive knowledge is not, in other words, that\\n', 'one is knowledge and the other really is not; it is that intuitive knowledge meets\\n', 'second-order normative as well as psychological conditions for certainty while\\n', 'sensitive knowledge meets only the psychological conditions. [Remember that neces-\\n', 'sary and sufficient for knowledge (in general) is the perception of an agreement or\\n', 'disagreement of ideas (with the subjective force of certainty attending any perception\\n', 'of agreement).] The additional epistemic condition of withstanding a reflective\\n', 'challenge determines the degree of certainty from a second-order normative per-\\n', 'spective and so the differences in the degrees of certainty of knowledge. Locke’s\\n', 'theory of the degrees of certainty of knowledge requires that different epistemic\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'conditions be met for each degree. And if we are confined to only what our\\n', 'perceptual faculties can deliver, then there is nothing wrong with appealing to\\n', 'probabilistic reasons to try to fend off the Cartesian skeptical worry. We can see\\n', 'Locke’s division of knowledge into three degrees of certainty as reflecting that worry,\\n', 'namely the demand for further normative justification for what we know and that\\n', 'any reasons available from a higher-order point of view should be taken into account.\\n', '\\n', 'Therefore, it makes sense to employ other reasons, including probabilistic argu-\\n', 'ments, to buttress sensitive knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'A question might arise whether the force of the probabilistic arguments is so\\n', 'weakened that they serve no real purpose in Locke’s theory, which would be a reason\\n', 'to favor interpretations that see sensitive knowledge as a form of judgment. I suggest\\n', 'that although they are now in the service of buttressing knowledge, the probabilistic\\n', 'arguments have the same relevance as they have in other interpretations. The reason\\n', 'is that they answer the same question, namely the second-order question whether on\\n', 'the basis of our ideas of sensation we should infer that there exist external things.\\n', '\\n', 'From that cognitive standpoint, when we ask that question, the probabilistic argu-\\n', 'ments are indeed important to consider.\\n', '\\n', 'This brings us back to the question why Locke seems so cavalierly unconcerned\\n', 'with the skeptical problem as traditionally put forward. Here we find the third\\n', 'analogous feature. To repeat the IV.xi.3 passage cited above, Locke clearly states\\n', 'his view that no one can “in earnest, be so skeptical, as to be uncertain of the\\n', 'Existence of those Things which he sees and feels.” Notice Locke’s claim that we\\n', 'cannot “in earnest” take a skeptical attitude to sensitive knowledge. Locke speaks of\\n', 'the same (although even greater) difficulty in assuming a skeptical attitude to\\n', 'intuitive knowledge in IV.ii.1. There Locke states that to demand a greater certainty\\n', 'than what we experience in intuitive knowledge “shews only that he has a Mind to be\\n', 'a Sceptick, without being able to be so” (my emphasis). To take the skeptic’s point of\\n', 'view with respect to intuitive knowledge is practically impossible. It seems that we are\\n', 'never able to get ourselves into a perceptual situation in which we can in good faith\\n', 'generate a reason not to accept what we know.\\n', '\\n', 'Although we can generate a reason to doubt our sensitive knowledge, and thus a\\n', 'skeptical attitude is possible, it cannot be held “in earnest,” for the force of the doubt\\n', 'cannot be maintained. I can step back to question reflectively whether I should accept\\n', 'what is psychologically unavoidable, in which case I might realize that all could be a\\n', 'dream. But as soon as I turn my attention back to the things affecting my senses—to\\n', 'my occurrent experiences, I will once again be in a cognitive situation psychologically\\n', 'indistinguishable from an instance of intuitive knowledge. Each time we regain the\\n', 'cognitive situation in which we have sensitive knowledge, we perceive the agreement\\n', 'and thus re-experience the psychological force of the certainty therein.109 Just as my\\n', '109 It is important to emphasize that in “turning my attention back to the things affecting my senses”\\n', 'I will have a new (occurrent) sense experience. Locke is clear that were I to return to a previous instance of\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'continued experience of the certainty of my intuitive knowledge makes me “incap-\\n', 'able” of a skeptical attitude, my continued experience of the certainty of my sensitive\\n', 'knowledge—albeit with intermittent breaks for reflective skeptical doubt—renders\\n', 'me “incapable” of a skeptical attitude. Skepticism can be neither maintained in\\n', 'experience nor solved from within the limits of our own understanding.110 This is,\\n', 'I suggest, Locke’s reply to the skeptic as well as the reason why he seems not to treat\\n', 'the skeptical challenge as seriously as some might think he should.\\n', '\\n', 'One might still object that Locke cannot allow psychological conditions to play\\n', 'such a dominant role in his theory of knowledge, for then we cannot account for the\\n', 'distinction Locke wants to draw between intuitive and demonstrative knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'Although each step in a demonstrative proof reduces to an intuitively perceived\\n', 'agreement, Locke is clear that demonstrative knowledge is still less certain—\\n', 'normatively less certain. The account I have provided, however, is fully consistent\\n', 'with Locke’s understanding of demonstrative knowledge. Consider this passage:\\n', 'By which it is plain, that every step in Reasoning, that produces Knowledge, has intuitive\\n', 'Certainty; which when the Mind perceives, there is no more required, but to remember it to\\n', 'make the Agreement or Disagreement of the Ideas, concerning which we enquire, visible and\\n', 'certain. So that to make any thing a Demonstration, it is necessary to perceive the Agreement of\\n', 'the intervening Ideas, whereby the Agreement or Disagreement of the two Ideas under\\n', 'Examination (whereof the one is always the first, and the other the last in the Account) is\\n', 'found. This intuitive Perception of the Agreement or Disagreement of the intermediate Ideas,\\n', 'in each Step and Progression of the Demonstration, must also be carried exactly in the Mind,\\n', 'and a Man must be sure that no part is left out; which because in long Deductions, and the use\\n', 'of many Proofs, the Memory does not always so readily and exactly retain: therefore it comes\\n', 'to pass, that this is more imperfect than intuitive Knowledge, and Men often embrace\\n', 'Falshoods for Demonstrations.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ii.7)\\n', 'The perception of the agreement between the original ideas in a case of demonstrative\\n', 'knowledge is psychologically unavoidable just as it is in intuitive and sensitive\\n', 'knowledge.

An idea is\\n', '“distinct,” for Locke, when it is “sufficiently distinguishable from another” (II.xxix.5).\\n', '\\n', 'A complex idea, which is most suitable for our purposes, is “confused” (the opposite of\\n', 'distinct) when “it is made up of too small a number of simple Ideas, whereby the\\n', 'differences, that make it deserve a different Name, are left out” (II.xxix.7). So, clarity\\n', 'and distinctness with respect to individual ideas are fully consistent with the case above\\n', 'in which Locke describes having (or not having) enough in the mind to perceive an\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'agreement of ideas. Furthermore, it is consistent with Locke’s account of retained (or\\n', '“habitual”) demonstrative knowledge, for that does not require that we are able to\\n', 'reconstruct the proof. Rather, we need only remember the certainty with which we once\\n', 'perceived the agreement and that there is an “immutability of the same relations\\n', 'between the same immutable things” (IV.i.9). In sum, then, the passage above from\\n', 'IV.ii.6 presents no problem for my interpretation.\\n', '\\n', 'If I can be permitted a brief digression, Descartes too, in the Rules for the Direction\\n', 'of the Mind, considered demonstrative knowledge as more vulnerable to mistake\\n', 'because of its reliance on memory. In “Rule Eleven,” Descartes distinguishes between\\n', 'a deduction that “involves a kind of movement of our mind” and one that “no longer\\n', 'signifies a movement but rather the completion of a movement”:\\n', 'That is why we are supposing that deduction is made through intuition when it is simple and\\n', 'transparent, but not when it is complex and involved. When the latter is the case, we call it\\n', '“enumeration” or “induction”, since the intellect cannot simultaneously grasp it as a whole,\\n', 'and its certainty in a sense depends on memory, which must retain the judgments we have\\n', 'made on the individual parts of the enumeration if we are to derive a single conclusion from\\n', 'them taken as a whole.\\n', '\\n', '(CSM I: 37; AT X: 408)\\n', 'Descartes adds only a few lines later:\\n', 'As we have said, conclusions which embrace more than we can grasp in a single intuition\\n', 'depend for their certainty on memory, and since memory is weak and unstable, it must be\\n', 'refreshed and strengthened through this continued and repeated movement of thought. Say,\\n', 'for instance in virtue of several operations, I have discovered the relation between the first and\\n', 'the second magnitude of a series, then the relation between the second and the third and the\\n', 'fourth, and lastly the fourth and the fifth: that does not necessarily enable me to see what the\\n', 'relation is between the first and the fifth, and I cannot deduce it from the relations I already\\n', 'know unless I remember all of them. That is why it is necessary that I run over them again and\\n', 'again in my mind until I can pass from the first to the last so quickly that memory is left with\\n', 'practically no role to play, and I seem to be intuiting the whole thing at once.\\n', '\\n', '(CSM I: 38; AT X: 408–9).\\n', '\\n', 'Descartes’s point here, not unlike Locke’s, is that although deduction itself is a mental\\n', 'faculty that leads to certainty, the less of a role memory has to play in constructing\\n', 'the proof, namely the more able we are to perceive the whole proof at once, the\\n', 'greater is our justification for certainty. Similarly, according to Locke, in long and\\n', 'complex proofs there is always the chance that I have forgotten a step, and so even if\\n', 'the original ideas actually agree, I have not perceived them to agree. And it is the\\n', 'perception of the agreement (the justification) that qualifies it as knowledge—not\\n', 'merely the agreement (the truth) itself.\\n', '\\n', 'One might also object that on this analysis of Locke there is no reason why\\n', 'demonstrative knowledge should be more certain than sensitive knowledge: In both\\n', 'cases, upon reflection, we can generate a reason to doubt what we cannot but accept\\n', 'when we perceive the agreement. All three degrees of knowledge have the same\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'psychological certainty when the agreement is perceived. So, what is the difference in\\n', 'normative warrant between demonstrative and sensitive knowledge such that the\\n', 'former has a higher degree of certainty than the latter? Although Locke does not directly\\n', 'address this objection, he could easily have said something like this: When I incur doubt\\n', 'with respect to my sensitive knowledge it is due to a wholesale failure with respect to my\\n', 'ability to distinguish the causes of my ideas. That is, I can experience my ideas as\\n', 'originating in the senses and yet be entirely mistaken about their causes. I realize on\\n', 'reflection that I am incapable of knowing whether my psychological experience is the\\n', 'result of external objects or whether it is actually the result of an evil demon or of\\n', 'electrodes attached to my brain. Therefore, the doubt I experience when I reflect upon\\n', 'my sensitive knowledge can never be inferentially satisfied. But this does not mean that\\n', 'Locke has not secured any knowledge gained through the senses. Indeed, were all our\\n', 'knowledge of external objects secured by inference, we would not be able to isolate the\\n', 'reflective doubt of the epistemologist from the impossibility of that doubt when having\\n', 'the psychological experience of being presently affected through the senses.\\n', '\\n', 'There is some demonstrative knowledge, however, for which I cannot generate a\\n', 'doubt, because the proofs are simple and the intervening ideas are never forgotten. For\\n', 'example, perhaps someone has taught the Essay enough times that she will never forget\\n', 'the intervening idea in knowing demonstratively that “the angles of a triangle are equal\\n', 'to two right angles.” When she steps back to reflect on that knowledge, she cannot\\n', 'generate a doubt. Because some demonstrative knowledge (but of course not all) resists\\n', 'reflective doubt, I do not reach a point at which I can raise a wholesale doubt as to the\\n', 'normative status of my cognitive position.

Rather, we have the ability to step back and willfully\\n', 'take a survey of what we perceive in order “to observe accurately all that is visible in\\n', 'it.” Here Locke is acknowledging both the unavoidability of our knowledge and what\\n', 'more is revealed about our knowledge when we consider it from a higher order\\n', 'perspective.\\n', '\\n', '3.III.5 Conclusion\\n', 'This concludes my discussion of Locke’s theory of knowledge and the role consciousness\\n', 'plays in it. I have focused on how we have knowledge of our own ideas, knowledge of\\n', 'ourselves, and knowledge of things external to us, because along with Locke I see these\\n', 'forms of knowledge as “peculiar” or, at least, not as clearly cases of the perception of an\\n', 'agreement of ideas—even though they are. They are cases of knowing particular truths\\n', 'that do not fit squarely under the definition of knowledge as a agreement of ideas in the\\n', 'sense in which we normally think of such agreements as employing general or abstract\\n', 'ideas, and leading to general knowledge. Moreover, although all perceptions of ideas are\\n', 'complex mental states with constituent elements (an idea perceived, an idea of existence,\\n', 'and consciousness), the agreements in these three forms of knowledge depend on just\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'these three constituents and what is implied in having them as a part of the perception of\\n', 'an idea. Realizing the complexity internal to perceptions of ideas allows us not only to\\n', 'make sense of, but also provide a coherent and structurally similar account of, all that\\n', 'Locke says about our intuitive knowledge of our own ideas and ourselves as well as about\\n', 'sensitive knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'It is now time to move on to the role of consciousness in Locke’s theory of personal\\n', 'identity. Here, too, we will see how consciousness as internal to a complex perceptual\\n', 'state allows Locke to establish a revolutionary theory of the diachronic identity of\\n', 'persons that is also sufficient for his moral and theological concerns. Furthermore,\\n', 'my interpretation can accommodate Locke’s commitments to the possibility of false\\n', 'memory and his apparent switching back and forth from a purely psychological\\n', 'account of consciousness as a state of awareness of ourselves to an account that seems\\n', 'also to include a metaphysical aspect to consciousness—as an ongoing self we are\\n', 'aware of in that mental state. What is more, the account avoids problems of\\n', 'circularity and transitivity at no cost.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '4\\n', 'Consciousness in Locke’s Theory\\n', 'of Personal Identity\\n', 'We see some very preliminary considerations of the role of consciousness in\\n', 'questions concerning personal identity in the first chapter of Book II of the Essay.\\n', '\\n', 'No doubt, here, Locke is responding to the Cartesian claim that the essence of the\\n', 'soul is to think, and so the soul must be always thinking: “I know it an Opinion,”\\n', 'Locke says, “that the Soul always thinks, and that it has the actual Perception of Ideas\\n', 'in it self constantly, as long as it exists; and that actual thinking is as inseparable from\\n', 'the Soul, as actual Extension is from the Body” (II.i.9). But then Locke, employing his\\n', 'method of taking an introspective look at our own thinking, counters the Cartesian\\n', 'view by admitting that there is nothing in our experience to back up this claim, and\\n', 'indeed dreamless sleep seems to justify the opposite.1 A better view perhaps, and\\n', 'more warranted by what we actually experience, according to Locke, is that thinking\\n', 'is not the essence of the soul but a power or activity of the soul.2 Even Locke’s\\n', 'concern with memory in these initial passages is in the service of establishing the\\n', 'plausibility (and the better hypothesis) that the soul has periods in which it does not\\n', 'think. Against the view that we might be always thinking and yet not remember it,\\n', 'Locke argues that that would be a very useless sort of thinking indeed. And it is highly\\n', 'implausible to imagine that memory regularly fails for all those hours in the night\\n', 'during which we are sleeping.3 In these arguments, we can see Locke as employing\\n', '1 Locke states, “But he, that would not deceive himself, ought to build his Hypothesis on matter of fact, and make it out by sensible experience, and not presume on matter of fact, because of his Hypothesis, that is, because he supposes it to be so; which way of proving amounts to this, That I must necessarily think all last night, because another supposes I always think, though I my self cannot perceive, that I always do so”\\n', '(II.i.10).\\n', '\\n', '2 “I confess my self, to have one of those dull Souls, that doth not perceive it self always to contemplate ideas, nor can conceive it any more necessary, for the Soul always to think, than for the Body always to move; the perception of Ideas being (as I conceive) to the Soul, what Motion is to the Body, not its Essence, but one of its Operations” (II.i.9).\\n', '\\n', '3 See II.i.15: “To think often, and never to retain it so much as one moment, is a very useless sort of thinking,” and also this passage, “Nature never makes excellent things, for mean or no uses: and it is hardly to be conceived, that our infinitely wise Creator, should make so admirable a Faculty, as the power of Thinking, that faculty which comes nearest the Excellency of his own incomprehensible Being, to be so idlely and uselessly employ’d at least ¼ part of its time here, as to think constantly, without remembering any of those Thoughts, without doing any good to it self or others, or being any way useful to any other part of Creation” (II.i.15).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'their shared acceptance of the “mental transparency thesis,” that all thinking is\\n', 'conscious, in order to combat one of Descartes’s most famous doctrines: his com-\\n', 'mitment to the essence of the soul as thinking and the emphasis on the nature of an\\n', 'immaterial substance as the necessary ground for our experience of ourselves as\\n', 'having continued psychological activity.\\n', '\\n', 'We see this in how Locke extends his analysis. In addition, he argues, maintaining\\n', 'that the soul always thinks, in combination with the facts of experience, leads to a\\n', 'number of implausible consequences. And here we start to see the beginning of Locke’s\\n', 'understanding of the role of consciousness in his thoughts on personal identity. For\\n', 'example, if the soul were always thinking, and I am conscious of all of my thinking, then\\n', 'my soul must be going elsewhere when I am sleeping. It is even possible that I share a\\n', 'soul with someone else: it inhabits my body when I am awake and so I am conscious of\\n', 'my thinking, but when I fall asleep, my soul must move on to continue thinking in\\n', 'another body. But then the crucial question is what constitutes the I, self, or person that is\\n', 'me when my soul (and its thinking) inhabits another body. Locke asks “Whether Castor\\n', 'and Pollux, thus, with only one Soul between them, which thinks and perceives in one,\\n', 'what the other is never conscious of, nor is concerned for, are not two distinct Persons,\\n', 'as Castor and Hercules; or as Socrates and Plato were?” (II.i.12). Notice here Locke’s\\n', 'dialectical move from Descartes’s (or anyone’s) reliance on the soul and its continued\\n', 'thinking to an appeal to consciousness for help in distinguishing different persons.\\n', '\\n', 'Even more interestingly, Locke emphasizes not just an awareness of any of our\\n', 'thoughts as ours, but more specifically the consciousness of pleasure and pain and its\\n', 'link to a concern for happiness as crucial to identifying a person: “For if we take\\n', 'wholly away all Consciousness of our Actions and Sensations especially of Pleasure\\n', 'and Pain, and the concernment that accompanies it, it will be hard to know wherein\\n', 'to place personal Identity” (II.i.11). Locke seems to be concluding that our awareness\\n', 'of our own pleasure and pain, which engenders a concern for ourselves insofar as we\\n', 'have experiences of that kind, is tied to consciousness and plays a role in personal\\n', 'identity. I think we can see Locke’s initial concerns with personal identity as not only\\n', 'pointing to the fallout of holding the view that thinking is the essence of the soul, but\\n', 'also considering what would constitute the diachronic identity of a person if not the\\n', 'continued existence of a soul.\\n', '\\n', 'Not until Locke added the II.xxvii chapter On Identity and Diversity to the second\\n', 'edition of the Essay, after the urging of William Molyneux, do we see a full account of\\n', 'issues of individuation and diachronic identity of different kinds of things, including\\n', 'persons, and the role of consciousness in establishing the latter.4 What was previously\\n', '(in the first edition) only a very cursory mention of consciousness and its link to\\n', 'personal identity is now (in the second edition) turned into a full-blown theory of\\n', 'personal identity in which consciousness, rather than substance (either corporeal or\\n', 'thinking), constitutes the criterion for the identity of persons. Indeed, Locke’s theory\\n', '4 Stuart (2013: 298).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'of personal identity, as we find it in II.xxvii of the second edition of the Essay, was\\n', 'philosophically groundbreaking for its attempt to establish a non-substantial identity\\n', 'condition, namely consciousness.5 Locke states, “For the same consciousness being\\n', 'preserv’d, whether in the same or different Substances, the personal Identity is\\n', 'preserv’d” (II.xxvii.13). There are two good reasons why Locke would want a theory\\n', 'of this kind, aside from the fact that the continuity of a thinking (or material)\\n', 'substance is empirically suspect. First, relying on a psychological rather than a\\n', 'substantial condition allows Locke to remain agnostic on the nature of thinking\\n', 'substance: whether or not it must be immaterial. Indeed, having a non-substantial\\n', 'identity condition is consistent with Locke’s claims to know very little at all about the\\n', 'nature of substance. Second, at least by Locke’s lights, the theory is compatible with his\\n', 'theological concerns. A psychological condition allows for some flexibility with regard\\n', 'to the theoretical particularities involved in Locke’s theological commitments to the\\n', 'immortality of the soul and the resurrection of the body.6 Moreover, both of these\\n', 'reasons are consistent with Locke’s overall task in the Essay of outlining the limits of\\n', 'human understanding. What is more, we can see an emphasis on a psychological\\n', 'condition as better in tune with his anti-essentialism and his moral theory, including\\n', 'his view that having certain psychological abilities (including intellectual abilities) is\\n', 'necessary to moral agency, rather than being a particular kind of substance.\\n', '\\n', 'But what exactly did Locke mean when he said that personal identity is preserved\\n', 'when the same consciousness is preserved? What does he mean by having “the same\\n', 'consciousness” (II.xxvii.13)? Let us take a look at some of the interpretive history.\\n', '\\n', 'Many have interpreted Locke to think that consciousness identifies a self both\\n', 'synchronically and diachronically by attributing thoughts and actions to a self.7 So,\\n', 'as far as we are conscious of our past thoughts and actions, we are the same person.8\\n', '5 See Thiel (1998) for a comprehensive discussion of his precursors and the revolutionary nature of Locke’s theory.\\n', '\\n', '6 Ayers (1991: II, 205) and Thiel (1998: 870–1) discuss these issues. See also McCann (1987: 68), who cites as another reason Locke’s desire to provide a theory that is compatible with Christian doctrine but does not also appeal to substantial forms. He says “If Locke can account for the identity of persons without calling upon any immaterial principles of unity—souls, substantial forms—then he will have snatched the best case away from the Scholastics.” I will have more to say about Locke’s theological commitments as we move on.\\n', '\\n', '7 I will follow the bulk of Locke scholarship by treating ‘self ’ and ‘person’ as synonymous. Note, however, that Locke does draw the following distinction: “Person, as I take it, is the name for this self. Wherever a Man finds, what he calls himself, there I think another may say is the same Person” (II.xxvii.26). I interpret the difference to be that ‘self ’ denotes that which we perceive from the subjective (first-personal) point of view, where as ‘person’ denotes the same thing as referred to from the objective (third personal) point of view.\\n', '\\n', 'What is being denoted in each case is the identity condition for persons. As will become clear, I am not arguing that Locke considered persons to be exhausted by their consciousness. For alternative views, see Thiel (1998: 891), who interprets ‘self ’ to refer either to the person or to the human being, and Yolton (2004: 23–4) for the view that ‘person’ designates a ‘moral self,’ while ‘self ’ designates a ‘secular self.’\\n', '8 Those attributing to Locke the view that the central issue concerns the subjective constitution of the self by means of consciousness of past and present thoughts and actions include Mackie (1976: 183), Behan (1979), Edwin Curley (1982: 310), Winkler (1998: 153f), Thiel (2011: 210), and LoLordo (2012: 70–4).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'Locke seems to confirm this interpretation when he refers to consciousness as that\\n', '“whereby I am my self to my self,” and then continues by saying,\\n', 'If there be any part of its Existence, which I cannot upon recollection join with that present\\n', 'consciousness, whereby I am now my self, it is in that part of its Existence no more my self, than\\n', 'any other immaterial Being.

As early as John Sergeant and Joseph Butler, Locke’s\\n', 'theory was accused of circularity, since knowing that one is identical to a past self, namely\\n', 'having a veridical memory of a past thought or action, presupposes that the criterion has\\n', 'already been met; there is already an identical self to know.10\\n', 'One way to address this problem, while still seeing personal identity as dependent on\\n', 'the attribution of past thoughts and actions to a self, is to see consciousness as not\\n', 'strictly identical to memory. As Mackie (1976: 178) first stated, rather, consciousness\\n', 'consists in the awareness of one’s thoughts and actions from the “inside.” So, in\\n', 'addition to any memories that are there, consciousness would include whatever I can\\n', 'attribute to myself in any moment—whatever I experience as mine. Thiel (2011: 210)\\n', 'puts it this way: “to Locke, whatever it is that I ascribe to myself through consciousness\\n', 'or memory is part of my personality, if not part of my self as a man or soul. Locke’s\\n', 'theory of personality could be vulnerable to the charge of circularity only if the\\n', 'distinction between person, man, and soul is rejected.” Such views have often been\\n', 'called “appropriation theories” of personal identity.

You can only appro-\\n', 'priate those past experiences that are available to you, and which past experiences are\\n', 'available to you depends on facts about what you remember.” Moreover, her view, she\\n', 'argues, does not collapse back into a memory theory, since there is “a causal connec-\\n', 'tion between memories and the sense experiences they present to us again.” Following\\n', 'Garrett (2003: 110ff), Locke’s account of memory includes a way of distinguishing a\\n', 'false from a genuine memory. LoLordo (2012: 73–4) explains it this way:\\n', 'Memory, for Locke, is not a matter of representing past ideas but of having those very same\\n', 'ideas again. The difference between eating an oyster and remembering the meal later is not that\\n', 'they involve different ideas: when you eat the oyster, you experience a certain group of ideas as\\n', 'ideas of sensation, and when you later remember the meal, you experience the same ideas as\\n', 'ideas of memory. . . . Thus, to remember a past action, your current memory experience must\\n', 'be caused by some past sensory experience of that action.\\n', '\\n', 'Using Garrett’s insight, LoLordo can ensure a causal connection between an original\\n', 'sense experience and a later appropriation of it. I think Garrett is right about\\n', 'memory, and I will make use of his view later in this chapter. For LoLordo to employ\\n', 'it, however, comes at too high a price. First, LoLordo’s view requires her to deny that\\n', 'consciousness transference, as Locke describes it in II.xxvii.13, results in false mem-\\n', 'ory. Indeed, on LoLordo’s account there is no possibility of false memory. Although\\n', 'others have made the same move, it conflicts with what Locke actually says in\\n', 'II.xxvii.13, when he specifically considers the possibility of false memory.13\\n', 'Second, there are several passages (II.x.5, II.x.10, II.i.15, IV.iv.2) in which Locke\\n', 'seems to say that the causal traces LoLordo relies on to guarantee the connection\\n', '13 See note 49 for a list of others who have denied Locke’s claim that false memory is possible, as well as for those who, like me, affirm and defend his claim that false memory is possible.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'between a past action (in memory) and a present appropriation of it are stored in the\\n', 'body.14 It follows that she would have to attribute to Locke the view that a con-\\n', 'sciousness must be resurrected with the same body.

LoLordo (2012: 94, n 56) acknowledges that\\n', 'Locke is not committed to the resurrection of the same body, but she does not\\n', 'consider those passages in which Locke attributes the causal traces in memory to the\\n', 'body. This is not to say that I do not agree with much of LoLordo’s view, for I do. But\\n', 'if, as I argue, we interpret Locke to include a metaphysical fact of consciousness, then\\n', 'we address the circularity threat as well as accommodate Locke’s commitment to\\n', 'divine rectification. And we do so without incurring either cost.\\n', '\\n', 'Another well-known problem facing Locke’s theory of personal identity, pointed\\n', 'to by both Reid and Berkeley, is its apparent failure to adhere to logical transitivity.15\\n', 'Reid’s explanation of the difficulty is most famous, so I will reiterate that one here:\\n', 'Suppose a brave officer to have been flogged when a boy at school, for robbing an orchard, to\\n', 'have taken a standard from the enemy in his first campaign, and to have been made a general\\n', 'in advanced life: Suppose also, which must be admitted to be possible, that when he took the\\n', 'standard, he was conscious of his having been flogged at school, and that when made a general\\n', 'he was conscious of his taking the standard, but had absolutely lost the consciousness of his\\n', 'flogging.\\n', '\\n', 'These things being supposed, it follows, from Mr. Locke’s doctrine, that he who was flogged\\n', 'at school is the same person who took the standard, and that he who took the standard is the\\n', 'same person who was made a general. Whence it follows, if there be any truth in logic, that the\\n', 'general is the same person with him who was flogged at school. But the general’s consciousness\\n', 'does not reach so far back as his flogging, therefore, according to Mr. Locke’s doctrine, he is not the same person who was flogged. Therefore, the general is, and at the same time is not the\\n', 'same with him who was flogged at school. (Reid 2002: 276)\\n', 'Many have tried to solve this problem for Locke, some by arguing that Locke does\\n', 'not mean to accept transitivity, others by arguing that his theory is consistent with it.\\n', '\\n', 'Thiel (2011: 213–20) argues quite persuasively that no effort so far succeeds—or if it\\n', 'succeeds, then it does so by attributing to Locke a theory that he does not really hold.\\n', '\\n', 'I will rehearse all of Thiel’s arguments here.

In a nutshell, a person (A) can remember a past self (B), and so be the same person as B. And B can remember a past self (C), and so be the same person as C. But A can fail to remember C, and so not be the same person as C. So A is the same person as B, and B is the same person as C, but A is not the same person as C.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'remember the flogged boy in principle, not actually.

That is,\\n', 'continuity between persons can be forged by memory links to various ancestor selves\\n', 'that remember the particular past self that a present self cannot remember. So, we\\n', 'have a continuity of consciousness without a complete continuity of memory. Even\\n', 'though Locke does not equate consciousness with memory, still this solution will not\\n', 'do. It is not sufficient for Locke’s understanding of moral responsibility and the role\\n', 'personal identity plays in it. Locke seems to think that I must be able to remember a\\n', 'specific past action in order to be held responsible for it: “For whatsoever any\\n', 'Substance has thought or done, which I cannot recollect, and by my consciousness\\n', 'make my own Thought or Action, it will no more belong to me, whether a part of\\n', 'me thought or did it, than if it had been thought or done by any other immaterial\\n', 'Being any where existing” (II.xxvii.24). This criticism can be extended to Winkler’s\\n', '(1998: 156), Garrett’s (2003: 103), and LoLordo’s (2012: 70n16) attempts to address\\n', 'the transitivity problem by arguing that in consciously appropriating any thought\\n', 'or action of a past self I automatically appropriate all the thoughts and actions of\\n', 'that self. For the same reasons, we can see why this does not work: attribution of\\n', 'moral responsibility seems to require that one actually remember the specific\\n', 'past action.16\\n', 'Finally, Yaffe’s (2007: 228) unique “susceptibility to punishment theory” argues\\n', 'that Locke reverses the “assumed order of priority of the metaphysical and the\\n', 'moral.” Facts about just punishment and reward ground the identity of a person,\\n', 'rather than the other way around, which avoids circularity for Locke. I note several\\n', 'objections to Yaffe’s interpretation later in the chapter. But even if we allow that he\\n', 'solves circularity, the interpretation does not seem to maintain transitivity. According\\n', 'to Yaffe, I am the same person as another if we are both punishable for the same\\n', 'action. But, unfortunately, because the relation of just punishment is not transitive,\\n', 'neither is the personal identity relation.17\\n', 'The general problem seems to be that Locke needs an objective criterion for the\\n', 'continued existence of the person in order to avoid circularity, be sufficient for divine\\n', 'rectification, and maintain logical transitivity.

To be clear, however, even though\\n', 'Locke’s contribution to contemporary accounts of personal identity is substantial,\\n', 'I am not also arguing that once Locke is rescued from incoherence, we should find his\\n', 'theory of personal identity as it stands on its own a convincing one.\\n', '\\n', 'The clue to my interpretation is that Locke’s conception of consciousness involves\\n', 'an ambiguity. In the II.xxvii. chapter devoted to personal identity, Locke seems to see\\n', 'consciousness as (1) a mental state inseparable from an act of perception by means of\\n', 'which we are aware of ourselves as perceiving, and (2) the ongoing self we are aware\\n', 'of in these conscious states.20 The first sense of consciousness, the one employed in his\\n', 'philosophical psychology and in his theory of knowledge, is a momentary psycho-\\n', 'logical state. It is the one that provokes the objections already mentioned. This sense\\n', 'of consciousness allows for a momentary subjective experience that the self presently\\n', 'perceiving is the same as the self that remembers having once had a past thought or\\n', 'action. ‘Subjective,’ here, is meant to describe something psychological, which is\\n', 'epistemically available only from a first-personal point of view. The second sense of\\n', 'consciousness, which is needed to answer the objections, is the objective fact of an\\n', 'ongoing consciousness. ‘Objective’ is meant to describe something that is epistemic-\\n', 'ally available from a third-personal (maybe only God’s) point of view. The ongoing\\n', 'self that I am aware of in being conscious of past and present thoughts and actions\\n', 'seems also to have an objective continued temporal existence through any gaps in my\\n', 'successive, subjective states of awareness of myself.21 Disambiguating these two\\n', 'senses of consciousness allows for a metaphysical fact, what I am also calling an\\n', '‘objective fact,’ of my diachronic existence. Thus, there is no problem of circularity or\\n', 'transitivity, and there is a metaphysical ground for Locke’s theory of divine rectifi-\\n', 'cation.

Mackie (1976: 178) attributes to Locke the use of ‘consciousness’ as both a “a concrete noun” and an “abstract verbal noun” in the sense that there can be “distinct incommunicable consciousnesses” (II.xxvii.23) as well as states of “being conscious.” In addition, in those conscious states we have some awareness of an I or of “perceiving ideas from the inside.”\\n', 'Nevertheless, he cannot find a way to explain how there can be an objective fact of an ongoing\\n', 'consciousness.

The only other exception I have found, also mentioned earlier, is Yaffe (2007: 226), who argues that we should attribute to Locke “the susceptibility-to-punishment theory of personal identity.” First, consciousness should be understood as the awareness of pleasure and pain. Second, x and y have the same consciousness “just in case the earlier’s actions are a potential source of pleasure or pain for the later.”\\n', 'Third, to avoid the objection that someone else’s action might be a source of my future pain Yaffe includes the element of desert. So, whether I am the same person now as I was in the past is determined by the fact that I am susceptible to punishment now for what a past person did. Yaffe (2007: 228–9) then argues that Locke replaces the metaphysical fact of personal identity with the moral fact of just desert: “the metaphysical facts—the facts about who is the same person as whom—just are the moral facts; they are facts about who is appropriately punished or rewarded for whose past acts.” Although I think Yaffe’s interpretation cleverly finds an objective criterion on which to base personal identity, it is not clear that Locke would endorse the priority of the moral fact over the metaphysical fact. Although Locke does say that “almost all”\\n', 'our perceptions of ideas are accompanied by perceptions of ideas of pleasure and pain, not all our thoughts and actions are moral; that is, they do not all involve being compared to laws and deserving of reward or punishment. Therefore, the self does not continue to exist between times of nonmoral actions—or no\\n', 'actions at all. And although persons must be “capable of laws” (II.xxvii.26), they need not always be engaging in moral action to be persons.\\n', '\\n', '25 It might be worthwhile to note that Locke saw his use of ‘mode’ as departing from the traditional sense: “And if in this [“the Ideas signified by the Words Triangle, Gratitude, Murther, etc.”] I use the word Mode, in somewhat a different sence from its ordinary signification, I beg pardon; it being unavoidable in Discourses, differing from the ordinary received Notions, either to make new Words, or to use old Words in somewhat a new signification” (II.xii.4).

According to Locke, the duration designated by a single perception of an\\n', 'idea is an “instant.” He says, “Such a part of Duration as this, wherein we perceive no\\n', 'Succession, is that which we may call an Instant; and is that which takes up the time of\\n', 'only one Idea in our Minds, without the Succession of another, wherein therefore we\\n', 'perceive no Succession at all” (II.xiv.10). Furthermore, Locke asserts that ‘duration’ is\\n', 'a synonym for ‘continued existence’: “we call the Existence, or the Continuation of\\n', 'the Existence of our selves, or anything else, Commensurate to the succession of any\\n', 'Ideas in our Minds, the Duration of our selves, or any such other thing co-existing\\n', 'with our Thinking” (II.xiv.3). And even though we can have only a momentary idea\\n', 'of our own duration or of the duration of any other thing, Locke seems to be saying\\n', 'that things endure through our successive perceptions of ideas of them. We get an\\n', 'idea of the length of that duration by using the ideas we have as marks for\\n', 'measurement. As Locke says, “Duration in it self is to be considered, as going on\\n', 'in one constant, equal, uniform Course: but none of the measures of it, which we\\n', 'make use of, can be known to do so” (II.xiv.21). Furthermore, God can know the\\n', 'continued existence of things as they persist through those ideas by which we\\n', 'measure them. Locke tells us that “God’s infinite Duration being accompanied with\\n', 'infinite Knowledge, and infinite Power, he sees all things past and to come; and they\\n', 'are no more distant from his Knowledge, no farther removed from his sight, than the\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'present” (II.xv.12). So, even though we cannot perceive the actual duration of things\\n', 'through the gaps in our perceptions of ideas, God can.\\n', '\\n', 'Also clear from II.xxvii.25 is that Locke understands consciousness as something\\n', 'that has “a continued duration more than one instant.” This confirms that Locke\\n', 'thinks consciousness has an ongoing existence through each instant in which we are\\n', 'conscious of ourselves as perceiving ideas. So, duration is the ongoing temporal\\n', 'existence of any thing as measured by a single perception of an idea, as measured\\n', 'between two immediately successive ideas, or even as measured between any gaps in\\n', 'my awareness of myself as thinking—say between the last idea I had prior to falling\\n', 'into a dreamless sleep and the first idea I had upon waking. And even though there\\n', 'are gaps in my awareness of my own continued existence, the full extent of my\\n', 'duration is known by God. Therefore, in II.xxvii.25 we are told, first, that conscious-\\n', 'ness is something that endures through each momentary instance of a conscious state\\n', 'of awareness of itself, and second, the way in which it endures is not to be explained\\n', 'by appeal to the traditional underlying metaphysics of substances and their modes.\\n', '\\n', 'More textual support that consciousness is something that endures through my\\n', 'momentary conscious states of myself is found in II.xxvii.10:\\n', 'For as far as any intelligent Being can repeat the Idea of any past Action with the same\\n', 'consciousness it had of it at first, and with the same consciousness it has of any present Action;\\n', 'so far is it the same personal Self.

Furthermore, it is the ongoing\\n', 'consciousness that “unites” successive perceptions of ideas: “yet ’tis plain consciousness,”\\n', 'Locke says, “as far as ever it can be extended, should it be to Ages past, unites Existences,\\n', 'and Actions, very remote in time, into the same person, as well as it does the Existence\\n', 'and the Actions of the immediately preceding moment” (II.xxvii.16). Whether the\\n', 'perception of an idea was in the distant past or whether it immediately precedes the\\n', 'present one, Locke seems to be saying that the same ongoing consciousness persists\\n', 'through and links together those momentary successive “Existences and Actions.”\\n', 'We see the same sort of thinking when Locke links consciousness to accountability\\n', 'and concern:\\n', 'This personality extends it self beyond present Existence to what is past, only by consciousness,\\n', 'whereby it becomes concerned and accountable, owns and imputes to it self past Actions, just\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'upon the same ground, and for the same reason, that it does the present.

Unless consciousness\\n', 'actually is the same continuing thing, there is nothing to consider accountable now for\\n', 'what might have been done in the past and nothing to consider as moving toward the\\n', 'future to be concerned for.26 Therefore, Locke must be thinking that our account-\\n', 'ability for the past and concern for the pleasures and pains we anticipate perceiving\\n', 'depends on the continued existence of the self we experience when we are conscious\\n', 'we are perceiving ideas.27 How, though, should we understand the metaphysics of a\\n', 'continuing consciousness without appealing to substance?\\n', '\\n', 'Perhaps Locke’s analogy between consciousness and the continued existence of\\n', 'other things is helpful here. In II.xxvii.1–8, Locke argues that a particular thing is\\n', 'individuated when at a particular place and time there begins to exist the condition\\n', 'that makes it the kind of thing it is and that excludes all other things of the same kind\\n', 'from occupying the same time and place.28 What identifies it through time is the\\n', 'continued existence of that condition. A particular living thing, say, a plant, animal,\\n', 'or human being, is individuated when its life begins to exist, and it continues to exist\\n', 'as the same animal as long as its life continues.29 Now Locke is clear in II.xxvii.10 that\\n', 'he intends his analysis of the individuation and identity of animals to be in some way\\n', 'analogous to the individuation and identity of persons:\\n', '26 My experience of a future self and the link between consciousness and a concern for my own\\n', 'happiness will be important to the discussion of the role of consciousness in Locke’s account of freedom and moral motivation, the topic of chapter five.\\n', '\\n', '27 We see the same priority of consciousness to happiness and misery and thus to concern in Cudworth, who argues that consciousness allows the self to be present to itself, which makes states of happiness and misery possible. Moreover, Cudworth (1678: 159) holds that this ‘Duplication’ of the self as subject and object via consciousness makes a being “to perceive it self to Do or Suffer, and to have a Fruition or Enjoyment of it self.” Consciousness as a fundamental form of self-reference allows for these other kinds of experiences of ourselves. See, again, Thiel (1991, 2011), Lähteenmäki (2010), and Pécharman (2014).\\n', '\\n', '28 This is often referred to as Locke’s “place-time-kind principle.” See Gordon-Roth (2015a) for a recent investigation into the various ways in which the principle is interpreted in the literature.\\n', '\\n', '29 See II.xxvii.4–6.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The Question being what makes the same Person, and not whether it be the same identical\\n', 'Substance, which always thinks in the same Person, which in this case matters not at all.\\n', '\\n', 'Different Substances by the same consciousness (where they do partake in it) being united into\\n', 'one Person; as well as different Bodies, by the same Life are united into one Animal, whose\\n', 'Identity is preserved, in that change of Substances, by the Unity of one continued Life.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxvii.10)\\n', 'It is reasonable to conclude that a person is individuated when consciousness begins\\n', 'to exist, and that the identity of the person corresponds to the continued existence of\\n', 'that particular consciousness.30 So, Locke must be thinking that consciousness has a\\n', 'continued existence.\\n', '\\n', 'Furthermore, the continued existence of consciousness cannot be merely the\\n', 'awareness of past thoughts and actions. Locke defines a person as “a thinking\\n', 'intelligent Being, that has reason and reflection, and can consider it self as it self,\\n', 'the same thinking thing in different times and places, which it does only by that\\n', 'consciousness” (II.xxvii.9). Since thinking is a succession of momentary ideas, each\\n', 'individual perception of an idea has no continued existence of its own.31 Thus, the\\n', 'only way a person can be the same from thought to thought is if consciousness has a\\n', 'continued existence from thought to thought. To employ the model of consciousness\\n', 'and its relation to perception from chapter two, the analogy would be that just as\\n', 'consciousness as a state of awareness of myself is a constituent of an act of thinking,\\n', 'yet something psychologically different from an act of thinking, consciousness as the\\n', 'ongoing self bears some sort of relation to the train of successive perceptions of ideas,\\n', 'yet is something metaphysically different from them. To use Locke’s words, just as\\n', 'the “Identity of the same Man consists . . . in nothing but a participation of the same\\n', 'continued Life, by constantly fleeting Particles of Matter, in a succession vitally\\n', 'united to the same organized Body” (II.xxvii.6, my emphasis in bold), the identity\\n', 'of the same person consists in nothing but a participation of the same continued\\n', 'consciousness, by constantly fleeting perceptions of ideas. Although the analogy is\\n', 'not strict in that Locke seems to think that life just is the organized particles of matter,\\n', 'while consciousness is something more than organized perceptions of ideas,32 the\\n', '30 See II.xxvii.9.\\n', '\\n', '31 Locke says, “Only as to things whose Existence is in succession, such as are the Actions of finite Beings, v.g. Motion and Thought, both which consist in a continued train of Succession, concerning their Diversity there can be no question: Because each perishing the moment it begins, they cannot exist in different times, or in different places, as permanent Beings can at different times exist in distant places; and therefore no motion of thought considered as at different times can be the same, each part thereof having a different beginning of Existence” (II.xxvii.2).\\n', '\\n', '32 I am hedging on whether the analogy is strict because I think what Locke says about the relation of the organized particles of matter to the life of an animal can be taken both ways. He says, “That in an Animal the fitness of the Organization, and the Motion wherein Life consists, begin together, the Motion coming from within” (II.xxvii.5). That “the Motion wherein Life consists” and “the fitness of the\\n', 'Organization” “begin together” can mean that they are the same thing or it could mean that the life is something different and emergent from the organization of the particles.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'point is that both life and consciousness are something metaphysically distinct from\\n', 'the fleeting things in which they participate.33\\n', 'The problem is that we still do not know anything about the metaphysics of a\\n', 'continuing consciousness. Notice, though, that neither (for Locke) do we know any-\\n', 'thing about the metaphysics of a continuing life. All we know is that plants, animals, and\\n', 'human beings continue living as the same things, despite their constant change of\\n', 'substance. Locke explains that in plants “there is an Organization of those parts, as is fit\\n', 'to receive, and distribute nourishment,” such that it continues as that plant. The\\n', 'organization “is that individual Life, which existing constantly from that moment\\n', 'both forwards and backwards in the same continuity of insensibly succeeding Parts”\\n', '(II.xxvii.4). In the next two sections, Locke confirms that “The Case is not so much\\n', 'different in Brutes” (II.xxvii.5) or in human beings (II.xxvii.6). The important point is\\n', 'that we do not need a full account of the “life” of an animal in order to know that it has\\n', '(there is) one and that it is something distinct from the fleeting particles of matter.\\n', '\\n', 'Indeed, Locke thinks a full account of what life consists in is beyond our understanding:\\n', '“We see Animals are generated, nourished, and move. . . . These and like Effects we see\\n', 'and know: but the causes that operate, and the manner they are produced in, we can\\n', 'only guess, and probably conjecture” (IV.xvi.12). I suggest that when Locke tells us that\\n', 'the continued existence of consciousness is analogous to the life of animals, he is saying\\n', 'just this sort of thing. We do not need a full account of consciousness in order to know\\n', 'that we have (there is) one and that it is distinct from our fleeting perceptions of ideas.\\n', '\\n', 'Locke acknowledges that not everything we know to exist has a tidy metaphysical\\n', 'explanation.

Indeed, Locke’s interlocutors desiring more explanation\\n', 'of how ideas—something else not neatly categorized—fit the substance/mode ontol-\\n', 'ogy were met with responses like the following:\\n', 'Supposing ideas real spiritual things ever so much, if they are neither substances nor modes, let\\n', 'them be what they will, I am no more instructed in their nature, than when I am told they are\\n', 'perceptions, such as I find them.

Uzgalis (1990: 292–3) relies on the analogy between consciousness and the life of an animal to conclude “immaterial substance is the cause of consciousness.” Uzgalis also argues that even though “immaterial substance has a causal role in\\n', 'producing consciousness, . . .

That is, what about Locke’s emphasis on\\n', 'occurrent mental states (memory, or what I can attribute to myself) as necessary for\\n', 'personal identity? Locke argues that substance cannot be the criterion, since being\\n', 'conscious of one’s past actions (having occurrent mental states) is what generates\\n', 'concern, moral responsibility, and a sense of oneself through time. Therefore, when it\\n', '41 Although I find much of Downing’s view compelling, this is the extent to which my view is\\n', 'committed to it.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'comes to personal identity, it seems that Locke is really interested in a psychological, not\\n', 'a metaphysical criterion. Second, what is the relation between consciousness and those\\n', 'occurrent mental states (memory)? These two questions are related in that those\\n', 'passages arguing that personal identity does not consist in substance are mostly the\\n', 'same passages in which Locke refers to “consciousness” as “consciousness of past\\n', 'actions,” namely occurrent (or remembered) mental states. Although this is textual\\n', 'evidence that Locke sees the criterion of personal identity as only psychological, I will\\n', 'argue that Locke’s considered view of the relation between consciousness and memory\\n', 'cuts against this reading by requiring an actual consciousness/mind/body composite to\\n', 'generate those mental states required for a first-personal concern for oneself and one’s\\n', 'actions. The importance of our psychological states for our experience of our own\\n', 'identity, therefore, does not preclude that Locke’s theory also includes a metaphysical\\n', 'criterion.\\n', '\\n', 'As for the first question, why would Locke allow a metaphysical criterion, a\\n', 'continuing consciousness, as an objective criterion for personal identity when he\\n', 'argues so vehemently against the view that substance can play the same role? I have\\n', 'four responses. First, I suggest that Locke is not against a metaphysical criterion, but\\n', 'only against allowing substance to serve as that criterion. As we know, Locke is\\n', 'agnostic as to the ultimate metaphysical nature of the world, and what we can know\\n', 'of it is only through our experience, namely through the ideas we have. Moreover,\\n', 'Locke is interested in the spatio temporal identity of things, which suggests that he is\\n', 'interested in actual things as they persist through time. Indeed, the first eight sections\\n', 'of II.xxvii are devoted to an analysis of what we should consider when we ask about\\n', 'the spatio temporal identity conditions of different kinds of things. In II.xxvii.8,\\n', 'Locke makes the point that old definitions of ‘human being’ should not rule our\\n', 'considerations, because the traditional idea (‘rational animal’) is ill equipped to\\n', 'capture what we really think human beings are. Locke’s repeating Prince Maurice’s\\n', 'story of the rational parrot that we would not call a man (because it does not have the\\n', 'right body shape) is evidence that Locke wants to reconsider identity conditions,\\n', 'including personal identity conditions, unhindered by traditional ideas.\\n', '\\n', 'Second, Locke thinks, at least in principle, that bodies, minds, and consciousnesses\\n', 'can be separated. But though Locke’s thought experiments (about the separation and\\n', 'transfer of bodies, minds, and consciousnesses) are meant to drive our thinking\\n', 'about what constitutes personal identity, I take them to represent mere possibilities.42\\n', 'So, even though it is possible that whatever configuration of real constitutions\\n', 'responsible for my conscious states can exist on its own, it will not be found without\\n', 'those configurations responsible for my mind (thinking) and my body.43 Locke\\n', '42 For more on the nature of Locke’s thought experiments, see Soles and Bradfield (2001).\\n', '\\n', '43 See II.i.20, where Locke says, “I see no reason therefore to believe, that the Soul thinks before the Senses have furnish’d it with Ideas to think on.” I take this to mean that both the body (sense organs) and the mind are necessary for thinking.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'thinks we are mind/body composites (human beings) regardless of what minds or\\n', 'bodies turn out to be. I am arguing that what he really thinks is that we are\\n', 'consciousness/mind/body composites (persons), where each component is onto-\\n', 'logically distinct regardless of what the underlying real constitutions turn out to\\n', 'be.44 Therefore, that there is a metaphysical fact of consciousness does not mean that\\n', 'it should be seen as reducible to worn-out notions of thinking or bodily substance.\\n', '\\n', 'An ontological scenario something like this is consistent with Locke’s claims\\n', 'about the relationships between our mental states. Locke tells us that we are con-\\n', 'scious of all of our thinking (II.i.19) and that consciousness “is inseparable from\\n', 'thinking” (II.xxvii.9). But he also claims that we have periods of dreamless sleep in\\n', 'which there is no thinking and therefore also no consciousness that we are thinking.\\n', '\\n', 'I have argued that consciousness in one sense is a state of awareness that I am\\n', 'thinking. Without consciousness, there is no experience of an I thinking. As has been\\n', 'noted in the literature, and as I argued in chapter two, seeing Locke to understand\\n', 'consciousness as identical to thinking—either first-order perception or second-order\\n', 'reflection—conflicts with other important commitments. We can, however, see\\n', 'consciousness as a self-conscious reflexive perception internal to (yet not identical\\n', 'to) any act of perception. This relation between our mental states is fully consistent\\n', 'with the claim that metaphysically we are created as body/mind/consciousness\\n', 'composites—or as single beings in which these parts are somehow united and act\\n', 'together. Likewise, the mental state that is consciousness is not identical to the mental\\n', 'state that is the perception of an idea; yet they are somehow united and work\\n', 'together. So, regardless of whatever mind/body composite my consciousness is\\n', 'annexed to, I will experience those thoughts as my own.

Chappell (1989: 78ff) argues for a similar view. Quite a lot of literature exists on the ontology of persons in Locke.

So, goes the worry, Locke seems to be thinking\\n', 'that consciousness is equivalent to our occurrent mental states.\\n', '\\n', 'We find something similar in Locke’s example of the prince and the cobbler:\\n', 'Should the Soul of the Prince, carrying with it the consciousness of the Prince’s past Life, enter\\n', 'and inform the Body of the Cobler as soon as deserted by his own Soul, every one sees, he\\n', 'would be the same person with the Prince, accountable only for the Prince’s actions. . . . But\\n', 'he would be the same Cobler to every one besides himself.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxvii.15)\\n', 'Since the consciousness that determines the prince’s identity is the “consciousness of\\n', 'the Prince’s past Life,” Locke seems to be saying that the prince’s memories are what is\\n', 'important about the prince’s consciousness rather than that the prince’s conscious-\\n', 'ness is something distinct from those occurrent thoughts. But notice also that in both\\n', 'cases Locke is emphasizing the first-personal point of view. In the case of Nestor and\\n', 'Thersites, I cannot identify myself with another if I cannot from my own point of view\\n', 'appropriate to myself what he did. In the last line of the passage about prince and the\\n', 'cobbler, Locke emphasizes that the prince recognizes the experience of his own mental\\n', 'states as his own, even though from the outside he is still the same cobbler to everyone\\n', 'else. The interpretation I am advocating does not deny that Locke uses ‘consciousness’\\n', 'ambiguously to refer both to an occurrent mental state of awareness of ourselves and\\n', 'to the ongoing self I am conscious of in that mental state. In some passages, the state of\\n', 'awareness is emphasized, while in others the ongoing self is emphasized.48\\n', 'A passage in which we see the ambiguity clearly, yet Locke emphasizes the meta-\\n', 'physical (objective or third-personal) reading of consciousness, comes in II.xxvii.13.\\n', '\\n', 'Here, Locke argues that were a consciousness transferred from one thinking substance\\n', 'to another, there would be a problem of false memory.

Again, I would argue that in these cases Locke is focusing on the first-personal awareness of ourselves.\\n', '\\n', '49 For example, Mackie (1976: 184–5) argues that Locke’s claims about false memory as the result of consciousness transference are inconsistent with the claim that consciousness retains memory, as we seem to find it in the example of the prince and the cobbler. For another view that this passage reveals an inconsistency in Locke’s theory, see Flew (1968). As mentioned earlier, a consequence of LoLordo’s (2012) view is that false memory is impossible. Those attempting to defend the consistency of this passage with the rest of Locke’s theory include Helm (1979), Alston and Bennett (1988), Garrett (2003), and Weinberg (2012).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'another cannot possibly have it, will be hard for us to determine, till we know what kind of\\n', 'Action it is, that cannot be done without a reflex Act of Perception accompanying it, and how\\n', 'perform’d by thinking Substances, who cannot think without being conscious of it. But that\\n', 'which we call the same consciousness, not being the same individual Act, why one intellectual\\n', 'Substance may not have represented to it, as done by it self, what it never did, and was perhaps\\n', 'done by some other Agent, why I say such a representation may not possibly be without Matter\\n', 'of Fact, as well as several representations in Dreams are, which yet, whilst dreaming, we take\\n', 'for true, will be difficult to conclude from the Nature of things.

Thus,\\n', 'when consciousness is transferred from one thinking substance (“Agent”) to another,\\n', 'the memories of the actions are transferred too. So when I occupy the new substance,\\n', 'that substance is now responsible for all those actions that I, as the transferred\\n', 'consciousness, either truly or falsely remember having done.

So that\\n', 'the new substance is punished by virtue of the transferred consciousness should not\\n', 'be problematic. There would be no reason for Locke to think, as he seems to, that\\n', 'God’s intervention is needed to save us from this possibility.\\n', '\\n', 'Moreover, this reading does not seem to be consistent with Locke’s view that\\n', 'consciousness transference results in the problem of false memory at all.

Therefore, reading conscious-\\n', 'ness as metaphysically distinct from memory makes sense of the problem of false\\n', 'memory. So although these passages emphasize the importance of the first-personal\\n', 'aspect of consciousness for generating concern for my past and future self, they do\\n', 'not preclude that Locke also sees consciousness as something metaphysical.50\\n', '50 This is not to deny that there is a textual tension, but only to show, first, that not all cases in which Locke argues that consciousness should not be identified with substance are also cases that lend to the view that consciousness consists in occurrent thought. Second, it should also increase the plausibility that Locke’s textual references to consciousness as something distinct and having metaphysical duration are meant seriously. Finally, if we take those references at face value, then we can rescue Locke’s theory from all three problems and without creating tensions elsewhere.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Indeed, Locke’s own account of memory seems to include a metaphysical differ-\\n', 'ence between consciousness, memory, and the power of the mind to revive ideas that\\n', 'is suggestive of a mind/body/consciousness composite in which there are distinct\\n', 'powers working together to result in an experience of remembering. This brings us to\\n', 'the second question: What is the relation of consciousness to memory? In Locke’s II.x\\n', 'account of memory, we find strong evidence that consciousness, although essential to\\n', 'experiencing an occurrent idea as a memory, is not identical to memory. In the\\n', 'following passage, Locke provides some explanation for how we should think of\\n', 'memory and the role of consciousness in having memories:\\n', 'For the narrow mind of Man, not being capable of having many Ideas under View and\\n', 'Consideration at once, it was necessary to have a Repository, to lay up those Ideas, which at\\n', 'another time it might have use of. But our Ideas being nothing, but actual Perceptions in the\\n', 'Mind, which cease to be any thing, when there is no perception of them, this laying up of our\\n', 'Ideas in the Repository of Memory, signifies no more but this, that the Mind has a Power, in\\n', 'many cases, to revive Perceptions, which it has once had, with this additional Perception\\n', 'annexed to them, that it has had them before. And in this Sense it is, that our Ideas are said to\\n', 'be in our Memories, when indeed, they are actually no where, but only there is an ability in the\\n', 'Mind, when it will, to revive them again; and as it were paint them anew on it self, though some\\n', 'with more, some with less difficulty; some more lively, others more obscurely. (II.x.2)\\n', 'First, we should see memory as a kind of “Store-house” or “Repository” for ideas that\\n', 'the mind can no longer have in view. But having memories in a repository is not to be\\n', 'confused with having a collection of ideas as normally experienced, say, as images of\\n', 'red and yellow, that can be plucked out as is and reintroduced into the mind. Rather,\\n', 'Locke explains that memories cease to be ideas—in fact they “cease to be any\\n', 'thing”—when they are not the objects of acts of perception. The “laying up of our\\n', 'Ideas in the Repository of Memory,” says Locke, “signifies no more but this, that the\\n', 'Mind has a Power, in many cases, to revive Perceptions” that it has had before. Locke\\n', 'seems to be saying that an instance of remembering is the revival of something that\\n', 'when revived is perceived as an idea, but is not an idea prior to the revival. This is\\n', 'why Locke says that our ideas are “actually no where” before they are revived.\\n', '\\n', 'Nevertheless, there has to be some more to this story, for surely Locke is not saying\\n', 'that the revived idea is uncaused. I suggest that there are two parts to the story. First,\\n', 'there is the question what it is to perceive an idea “from memory” as opposed to\\n', '“from sensation” or as the result of another mental operation. Second, there is the\\n', 'question what a memory consists in prior to being revived.\\n', '\\n', 'Let’s consider the first question. For Locke, the power of the understanding\\n', 'comprises all the powers associated with perception, or thinking (II.vi.2). Having\\n', 'an idea in the mind just is the exercise of the mind’s power of perception in the form\\n', 'of a particular mental operation, say, sensing, reflecting, contemplating, or reviving,\\n', 'as it is directed toward an idea. In the case of sensation, there is an impression in the\\n', 'senses and a power of the mind to perceive, which results in the perception of an idea\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'of sensation (II.i.24). In the case of having a memory, there is something stored away\\n', 'and a power of the mind to revive (perceive) it, which results in the perception of an\\n', 'idea from memory. In the previous passage from II.x.2, Locke explains that when the\\n', 'mind exercises the power of revival, the ideas perceived come with “this additional\\n', 'Perception annexed to them, that it has had them before.” To repeat some of what\\n', 'was discussed in part II of chapter three, the “additional Perception,” Locke confirms,\\n', 'is due to consciousness:\\n', 'For to remember is to perceive anything with memory, or with a consciousness, that it was\\n', 'known or perceived before: without this, whatever Idea comes into the mind is new, and not\\n', 'remembered: This consciousness of its having been in the mind before, being that, which\\n', 'distinguishes Remembring from all other ways of thinking.\\n', '\\n', '(I.iv.20)\\n', 'These passages seem to indicate that the psychological experience of remembering is\\n', 'due to the consciousness, or awareness, of the way of perceiving when an idea is\\n', 'revived in the mind. Consciousness provides for my experience of my own\\n', 'thinking—that the idea is the result of a reviving instead of, say, an occurrent sensing\\n', 'or a reflecting.\\n', '\\n', 'Locke, as I argued in parts II and III of chapter three, employs consciousness in the\\n', 'same way in his IV.ii.14 account of sensitive knowledge. When I perceive an idea of\\n', 'an external object by way of sensation, I am conscious that it is from sensation. At the\\n', 'risk of repeating this passage yet again, Locke says:\\n', 'But yet here, I think, we are provided with an Evidence, that puts us past doubting: For I ask\\n', 'any one, Whether he be not invincibly conscious to himself of a different Perception, when he\\n', 'looks on the Sun by day, and thinks on it by night. . . . We as plainly find the difference there is between an Idea revived in our Minds by our own Memory, and actually coming into our\\n', 'Minds by our own Senses.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ii.14)\\n', 'The conscious experience of our ideas allows us to identify their perceptual source.\\n', '\\n', 'Therefore, consciousness should neither be confused with memory itself (the “reposi-\\n', 'tory”) nor with the perceptual act or power of revival.\\n', '\\n', 'What is more, defects of memory, for Locke, are defects in thinking, that is, defects\\n', 'involved in reviving ideas, not defects in the consciousness that the ideas revived are\\n', 'from memory. Locke describes the two defects of memory as “ignorance,” when the\\n', 'mind “loses the Idea” completely, and “stupidity,” when the mind acts so slowly that\\n', 'the ideas are not revived “when need and occasion calls for them” (II.x.8). In either\\n', 'case, forgetfulness has nothing to do with consciousness. True, to have the experience\\n', 'that I am remembering or that I am the same self now that I was in the past requires\\n', 'that I be able to revive an idea. But this does not mean that what is involved\\n', 'in reviving an idea should be identified with the consciousness that I have had that\\n', 'idea before.\\n', '\\n', 'What, then, is the metaphysical explanation for memory? How can Locke say that\\n', 'ideas are “no thing” prior to being objects of acts of perception? I suggest that Locke\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'says this because we have no conscious experience of whatever precedes an idea. And,\\n', 'although, for Locke, all thinking is conscious, the ideas must be revived before what is\\n', 'in the mind counts as thinking—since thinking just is having ideas. So it is not\\n', 'inconsistent with Locke’s view that there is something prior to thinking that might\\n', 'result in thinking that is not conscious, that is, not yet a mental item of experience.\\n', '\\n', 'We get some indication of what this something might be for Locke at the end of\\n', 'II.x. Here Locke argues that not only humans but other animals, too, have this\\n', '“faculty of laying up, and retaining the Ideas, that are brought into the mind”\\n', '(II.x.10). Not only do sounds “mechanically cause a certain motion of the animal\\n', 'Spirits, in the Brains of those Birds, whilst the tune is actually playing,” which then\\n', 'results in particular motions of the wings or body, but also birds are able to recall a\\n', 'sequence of notes when they are no longer directly affected through their senses or\\n', 'when the imitation is necessary for preservation. What explains memory in the case\\n', 'of other animals? Locke says:\\n', 'But which is more, it cannot with any appearance of Reason, be supposed (much less proved)\\n', 'that Birds, without Sense and Memory, can approach their Notes, nearer and nearer by\\n', 'degrees, to a Tune play’d yesterday; which if they have no Idea of in their Memory, is now\\n', 'no-where, nor can be a Pattern for them to imitate, or which any repeated Essays can bring\\n', 'them nearer to. Since there is no reason why the sound of a Pipe should leave traces in their\\n', 'Brains, which not at first, but by their after-endeavors, should produce the like Sounds; and\\n', 'why the Sounds they make themselves, should not make traces which they should follow, as\\n', 'well as those of the Pipe, is impossible to conceive.\\n', '\\n', '(II.x.10)\\n', 'Although a little difficult to follow, Locke is suggesting that the ability birds have to\\n', 'repeat a pattern or imitate a tune is due to the ability to record what they have\\n', 'experienced as traces in the brain, which “by their after-endeavours” result in a later\\n', 'production of those sounds.51 It is quite plausible to think that the case is similar in\\n', 'human beings.

In either case, though, for Locke, there is unity of consciousness, since the technical sense of reflection takes another act of perception (a mental operation) as its object. As I will discuss in more detail in chapter five, whenever there are simultaneous perceptions of ideas (or acts of perception), there will be an experience of unity of consciousness.\\n', '\\n', '57 See, again, chapter three, section 3.II.4, and section 4.2 of this chapter for Locke’s account of memory and particularly the phenomenology of memory. And as mentioned in section 2.5, I give a promissory note to provide ample textual evidence establishing an experience of the unity of consciousness in various perceptual situations.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'diachronic self. When I am conscious I am remembering, I have a momentary\\n', 'psychological state in which I experience myself as extending into the past. So,\\n', 'even though the self that I am conscious of as remembering past actions is the\\n', 'objectively existing synchronic self, I experience myself as existing diachronically.\\n', '\\n', 'Second, how should we treat the self-knowledge we claim by virtue of our\\n', 'psychological experience in terms of what is epistemically justified? Drawing a\\n', 'comparison between Locke and Descartes and their different requirements for\\n', 'what counts as knowledge of the synchronic and diachronic existence of the self is\\n', 'helpful here. Descartes establishes the synchronic existence of the self through the\\n', 'cogito argument: “So after considering everything very thoroughly, I must finally\\n', 'conclude that this proposition, I am, I exist, is necessarily true whenever it is put\\n', 'forward by me or conceived in my mind” (CSM II: 16; AT VII: 25). Now it is not in\\n', 'the least controversial to attribute to Descartes the view that we also continue to exist\\n', 'through time.58 But Descartes struggles with establishing the fact of the diachronic-\\n', 'ally existing self. In the “Synopsis” to the Meditations, Descartes admits that in order\\n', 'to establish the continuity of the soul, and thus its immortality, he would have to give\\n', '“an account of the whole of physics” (CSM II: 10; AT VII: 14). For to know that\\n', 'substances continue to exist depends on knowing that “absolutely all substances,\\n', 'which must be created by God in order to exist, are by their nature incorruptible and\\n', 'cannot ever cease to exist unless they are reduced to nothingness by God’s denying\\n', 'his concurrence to them” (CSM II: 10; AT VII: 14). Establishing the fact of our\\n', 'diachronic existence requires both that we establish the fact that we are incorruptible\\n', 'substances, which requires a full account of physics, and that God does not deny his\\n', 'concurrent activity such that we cease to exist.\\n', '\\n', 'Descartes, as we know, has a very high standard for knowledge. This is one place\\n', 'where Locke’s epistemology departs from Descartes’s.59 As we saw in part III of\\n', 'chapter three, Locke has different epistemic standards. Knowledge comes in different\\n', 'degrees depending on the way in which we perceive agreements and then to what\\n', 'extent we are rationally justified in accepting what is presented to us in virtue of our\\n', 'perceptual situations. Intuitive and sensitive knowledge present similar perceptual\\n', 'situations: There is an immediate experience of certainty just in virtue of the percep-\\n', 'tion of the agreement.60 Nevertheless, Locke maintains that intuitive and sensitive\\n', '58 For example, see Wilson (1978: 66) and McCann (1986: 461). Despite Descartes’s own lack of\\n', 'philosophical justification for the continued existence of the self, McCann suggests a way in which Descartes could have made that case. McCann’s argument goes roughly like this: The diachronic identity of anything is determined by what persists through change. For Descartes, substances are conceived\\n', 'through their primary attribute, which in the case of material substances is extension. From the Second Meditation example of the wax, what persists through changes in corporeal substance is extension. Since what persists through changes in thinking substances is thinking, namely the principle attribute, we can draw the analogy that just as extension provides material continuity through time, thinking (as memory) provides psychological continuity through time.\\n', '\\n', '59 Another place is Descartes’s understanding of all knowledge as requiring an act of the will.\\n', '\\n', '60 Because the important parallels are concerned with the immediately perceived agreements (non-\\n', 'inferential knowledge), demonstrative knowledge is not relevant to the argument.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'knowledge carry different degrees of certainty. The difference in the degree is\\n', 'whether there is room for doubt when I step back to consider whether I ought to\\n', 'accept what is so very certain to me. Do I have any reasons to doubt what is presented\\n', 'to me as psychologically unavoidable? As we saw, intuitive knowledge allows no\\n', 'room for doubt, while sensitive knowledge does. But even though I can generate\\n', 'doubt with respect to my sensitive knowledge, for Locke, it still counts as knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'The difference, then, between sensitive and intuitive knowledge is a difference in\\n', 'normative warrant. I cannot generate reasons why I should not accept my intuitive\\n', 'knowledge. Each and every time I am conscious I am perceiving an idea of white and\\n', 'an idea of black I know immediately just in virtue of perceiving those ideas that\\n', '“white is not black.” Likewise, whenever I perceive any idea I am conscious that\\n', 'I exist. The fact of my existence is presented to me as psychologically unavoidable:\\n', '“I exist” is given to me as the result of the complexity of any perception of an idea.\\n', '\\n', 'Any attempt to generate a doubt merely reinforces my knowledge, since in any act of\\n', 'thinking I will know the fact of my existence all over again. Similarly, I have sensitive\\n', 'knowledge as the result of the complexity of the perception of an occurrent idea of\\n', 'sensation. My knowledge that there really and actually exists something external to\\n', 'me is immediate and psychologically unavoidable. But, unlike my experience in\\n', 'having intuitive knowledge, when I step back from my sensitive knowledge and ask\\n', 'whether I should accept what is so very certain to me, there is room for doubt. After\\n', 'all, it is possible that all is a dream or that I am the victim of the machinations of an\\n', 'evil demon.\\n', '\\n', 'My knowledge of my diachronic existence can be seen as analogous to sensitive\\n', 'knowledge. In my experience of my own thinking I do not differentiate between the\\n', 'synchronic and the diachronic self. I have an immediate and psychologically\\n', 'unavoidable experience of the unity of consciousness—my own continued\\n', 'existence—in virtue of the complexity of my mental states: for example, in the\\n', 'complex perceptual state that is reflecting on a memory. Like both intuitive and\\n', 'sensitive knowledge, “I continue to exist,” or “I am the same self now as I was then” is\\n', 'given to me as internal to this complex mental state. In virtue of my perceptual\\n', 'situation, I have the immediate certainty that I continue to exist. But like sensitive\\n', 'knowledge, when I step back and question what is so very certain to me in virtue of\\n', 'my psychological experience, there is room for doubt. Just as it is possible—though\\n', 'highly unlikely—that all is a dream or that I am the victim of an evil demon, it is\\n', 'possible—though highly unlikely—that I do not continue to exist through my gaps in\\n', 'memory or even between those discrete instances in which I am conscious of myself\\n', 'as perceiving successive ideas.61\\n', 'Although Locke did not say this, it is consistent with his view of knowledge to have\\n', 'said something like the following: the experience I have of my diachronic existence\\n', '61 We will see in the next chapter that we experience unity of consciousness in cases of perceiving a succession of ideas that do not involve memories—something like an experience of an “extended present.”\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'counts as knowledge, but it is more like sensitive knowledge, since it does not meet\\n', 'the higher epistemic standard for other forms of knowledge. Just as sensitive know-\\n', 'ledge is a lesser form of knowledge falling somewhere between demonstrative\\n', 'knowledge and probability, the knowledge we have of the diachronic self would fall\\n', 'somewhere in that range too. Yet, like sensitive knowledge, I can generate a doubt.\\n', '\\n', 'Unfortunately, Locke does not specifically point to any parallels between our know-\\n', 'ledge of personal identity and his Book IV analysis of knowledge. It could be that\\n', 'because the personal identity chapter was a later addition to the second edition of the\\n', 'Essay, Locke did not take the time to return to Book IV to note explicitly the parallels\\n', 'that are there implicitly. Nevertheless, given the interpretation of Locke’s theory of\\n', 'knowledge as argued for in the last chapter, these parallels can be elicited.\\n', '\\n', 'Interestingly, too, Kant, in the third paralogism, makes a parallel point with\\n', 'respect to the difference between the inevitability of our cognitive experience and\\n', 'what is epistemically justified from an external point of view. In order to cognize the\\n', 'identity of something, I attend to what persists against the background of what\\n', 'changes. In cognizing my own identity I attend to the persistence of the I against\\n', 'the background of “successive determinations” of the I, namely through the time of\\n', 'the successive instances of the I as thinking. Since time is the form of inner sense, the\\n', 'experience of my own thinking is necessarily of myself as unified in time. Kant states,\\n', '“The identity of the person is therefore inevitably to be encountered in my own\\n', 'consciousness.”62 Even so, for Kant, we cannot from the inevitability of our own\\n', 'cognitive experience draw the further conclusion that we are something persisting\\n', 'through time:\\n', 'For we cannot judge even from our own consciousness whether as soul we are persisting or not,\\n', 'because we ascribe to our identical Self only that of which we are conscious; and so we must\\n', 'necessarily judge that we are the very same in the whole of the time of which we are conscious.\\n', '\\n', 'But from the standpoint of someone else we cannot declare this to be valid because, since in the\\n', 'soul we encounter no persisting appearance other than the representation “I,” which accom-\\n', 'panies and connects all of them, we can never make out whether this I (a mere thought) does\\n', 'not flow as well as all the other thoughts that are linked to one another through it.63\\n', 'I cite these passages from Kant only to show that drawing the distinction between\\n', 'what is so very certain to us from the point of view of our own cognitive experience,\\n', 'yet at the same time is epistemically unjustifiable from an external point of view, has\\n', 'very much to do with the limits of human understanding. Although the difference\\n', 'between Kant’s and Locke’s philosophical treatment and appreciation of these limits\\n', 'is vast, Locke’s acceptance of the inevitability of what is presented to us in conscious-\\n', 'ness plays a large role in his philosophy.\\n', '\\n', 'I propose that having to admit that we do not know the metaphysical fact of our\\n', 'own diachronic existence beyond the degree of certainty given in our psychological\\n', '62 Kant (1998: 423).\\n', '\\n', '63 Kant (1998: 424).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'experience of it, therefore, is not such a heavy burden for Locke’s theory to bear. After\\n', 'all, Locke is concerned to discover the limits of human understanding, given the\\n', '“Historical, plain Method” of looking to facts of our own experience. The analysis of\\n', 'what constitutes personal identity is just one example where Locke comes up against\\n', 'those limitations. Another example, as previously argued, is in the analysis of\\n', 'sensitive knowledge. Nevertheless, our cognitive limitations with respect to what\\n', 'the senses determine for us have no real impact on our lives, for those limitations do\\n', 'not affect our happiness and misery:\\n', 'But yet if he be resolved to appear so sceptical, as to maintain, that what I call being actually in the Fire, is nothing but a Dream; and that we cannot thereby certainly know, that any such\\n', 'thing as Fire actually exists without us: I answer, That we certainly finding that Pleasure or Pain follows upon the application of certain Objects to us, whose Existence we perceive, or dream\\n', 'that we perceive, by our Senses, this certainty is as great as our Happiness, or Misery, beyond\\n', 'which, we have no concernment to know, or to be. So that, I think, we may add to the two\\n', 'former sorts of Knowledge, this also, of the existence of particular external Objects, by that\\n', 'perception and Consciousness, we have of the actual entrance of Ideas from them.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ii.14)\\n', 'Although I do not have full epistemic warrant that there really is a fire in front of me\\n', 'when I perceive an idea of the heat on my hand, I have no concern for the lessened\\n', 'degree of my knowledge, since I will have the same experience of pain regardless of\\n', 'whether the fire actually exists or I am merely a part of a perpetual dream. Therefore,\\n', 'that my sensitive knowledge does not achieve the higher standards of other forms of\\n', 'knowledge has no real impact on what is most important to me.\\n', '\\n', 'Interestingly enough, Locke has the same sort of reply to what we might call the\\n', 'skeptical concern with respect to personal identity. Although the argument is not\\n', 'structurally the same, the point is the same: We need not have full epistemic warrant\\n', 'concerning the metaphysical fact of our or someone else’s diachronic existence in\\n', 'order to have knowledge sufficient for our concerns. With respect to personal\\n', 'identity, the skeptical concern gains importance in issues of moral responsibility.\\n', '\\n', 'Whether or not I am the same person from time to time is crucial for determinations\\n', 'of just reward and punishment. Moreover, as I have argued, Locke thinks there is a\\n', 'metaphysical fact of our continued existence. Thus he says,\\n', 'But is not a man Drunk and Sober the same Person, why else is he punish’d for the Fact he\\n', 'commits when Drunk, though he be never afterwards conscious of it? Just as the same Person,\\n', 'as a Man that walks, and does other things in his sleep, is the same Person, and is answerable\\n', 'for any mischief he shall do in it.\\n', '\\n', 'In spite of the drunkard’s inability to remember that he was the one who committed\\n', 'the crime, he is still answerable for it. For punishment is assigned to the person,\\n', 'insofar as he continues to exist through the succession of momentary thoughts and\\n', 'actions. Though the drunkard and the sleepwalker experience gaps in their awareness\\n', 'of themselves as perceiving ideas, nevertheless, there is a fact of their ongoing\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'existence through those gaps. And even though we do not have full epistemic warrant\\n', 'that they are the same person, the degree to which the evidence points in that\\n', 'direction far outweighs the very unlikely possibility that there are gaps in their\\n', 'existences corresponding to their inability to remember their actions. Therefore,\\n', 'Locke continues that\\n', 'Humane Laws punish both [the drunkard and the sleepwalker] with a Justice suitable to their\\n', 'way of Knowledge: Because in these cases, they cannot distinguish certainly what is real, what\\n', 'counterfeit; and so the ignorance in Drunkenness or Sleep is not admitted as a plea. For though\\n', 'punishment be annexed to personality, and personality to consciousness, and the Drunkard\\n', 'perhaps be not conscious of what he did; yet Human Judicatures justly punish him; because the\\n', 'Fact is proved against him, but want of consciousness cannot be proved for him. But in the\\n', 'great Day, wherein the Secrets of all Hearts are laid open, it may be reasonable to think, no one\\n', 'shall be made to answer for what he knows nothing of.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxvii.22)\\n', 'We have to live our lives in terms of our cognitive limitations, and courts of law, says\\n', 'Locke, punish in a way suitable to those limitations. Though courts of law cannot\\n', 'from an external point of view “distinguish certainly what is real, what counterfeit”\\n', 'with respect to the metaphysical fact of the drunkard’s continued existence, prosecu-\\n', 'tors are capable of generating a barrage of reasons pointing to that fact. Indeed, Locke\\n', 'asserts that in some matters of fact, especially those that are of great concern to us,\\n', 'the “Probabilities rise so near to certainty . . . we make little or no difference between\\n', 'them and certain knowledge” (IV.xvi.6). So, the drunkard’s plea that he cannot\\n', 'remember the crime cannot be given much evidential weight in light of all the other\\n', 'reasons pointing to the fact that he committed the crime.\\n', '\\n', 'But notice that Locke does account for the case in which the drunkard’s or the\\n', 'sleepwalker’s gap in consciousness truly coincides with a gap in his continued\\n', 'existence. It is a very remote possibility, but a possibility nonetheless—much like\\n', 'the possibility that all is a dream or that I am the victim of an evil demon. But Locke\\n', 'has a solution to this too. In the extraordinarily unlikely event that the drunkard’s\\n', 'lack of memory actually does correspond to a gap in his continued existence, God\\n', 'will ensure his just deserts. Once all of one’s continued existence is accounted for in\\n', 'the day of reckoning, “no one shall be made to answer for what he knows nothing of.”\\n', 'Locke’s example of the drunkard confronts us with the limits of our knowledge. Why\\n', 'Locke thinks such limitations need not concern us is that God makes sure we are\\n', 'sufficiently supplied with what we need.\\n', '\\n', 'God, therefore, rectifies the limits of our understanding by punishment suitable to\\n', 'God’s way of knowledge. Even though my knowledge of the metaphysical fact of my\\n', 'diachronic existence is incomplete, and hence I do not know all that I have done, God\\n', 'does. Locke assures us that “conformable” to the fact that we are not “created\\n', 'miserable”:\\n', 'At the Great Day, when every one shall receive according to his doings, the secrets of all hearts\\n', 'shall be laid open. The sentence shall be justified by the consciousness all Persons shall have,\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'that they themselves in what Bodies soever they appear, or what Substances soever that\\n', 'consciousness adheres to, are the same, that committed those Actions, and deserve that\\n', 'Punishment for them.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxvii.26)\\n', 'To be created miserable would be to have no control over my own happiness or\\n', 'misery, namely to be eternally damned for that which I bear no responsibility.

Therefore, our cognitive limitations with respect to\\n', 'having full knowledge of our own diachronic identity do not affect what is most\\n', 'important to us, namely our eternal happiness and misery.\\n', '\\n', '4.4 Conclusion\\n', 'Traditionally, Locke is considered to have a psychological account of personal\\n', 'identity that relies on consciousness as the criterion. The criticisms it has faced are\\n', 'numerous. If the psychological theory is taken also as a metaphysical theory, then\\n', 'there is a problem of circularity. If Locke is interpreted to have an appropriation\\n', 'theory, in which the first-personal attribution to ourselves of occurrent mental states\\n', 'is sufficient for personal identity, then the theory fails transitivity or it is ill equipped\\n', 'to meet the demands of Locke’s commitment to divine rectification. Consciousness\\n', 'must be something persisting metaphysically for there to be sufficient connectivity\\n', 'through memory between past and present selves for transitivity to hold and for there\\n', 'to be something for God to look to in determining those actions for which we can be\\n', 'justly punished or rewarded. Those who bolster a reliance on appropriation with a\\n', 'causal relation between an idea originally perceived and an idea revived from\\n', 'memory may provide enough for divine rectification, but they saddle Locke with\\n', 'an inconsistency when it comes to his claims about consciousness transference and\\n', 'false memory. And those interpretations do not resolve the problem of transitivity.\\n', '\\n', 'Moreover, Locke is adamant that the objective metaphysical criterion, what has\\n', 'ongoing continuity, is not substance, nor did he give a nod to the “probable Opinion”\\n', 'that it might be a mode. I have argued, rather, that Locke remains agnostic about the\\n', 'metaphysics of an enduring consciousness except that it is consistent with a broader\\n', 'metaphysics of real constitutions and power. Consistent with this view, I have argued\\n', 'that Locke sees persons as mind/body/consciousness composites in which all three\\n', 'components are configurations of real constitutions that are somehow united. In\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'addition, I have argued that Locke’s metaphysical account of memory as consisting in\\n', 'causal traces in the brain helps to support the interpretation that we are mind/body/\\n', 'consciousness composites, and that although occurrent mental states are necessary to\\n', 'experience and identify myself as the same self, it is the ongoing consciousness that\\n', 'does the work from a third-personal point of view. Thus, I have succeeded in solving\\n', 'all three of the problems traditionally associated with Locke’s theory of personal\\n', 'identity, and I have done it without causing tensions elsewhere in Locke’s philosophy.\\n', '\\n', 'Finally, I have argued that Locke uses ‘consciousness’ ambiguously both to mean a\\n', 'state of awareness of myself as thinking and as the ongoing self I am aware of in that\\n', 'conscious state. Where the metaphysical fact of my ongoing self is revealed to me as a\\n', 'phenomenological experience of a diachronic self, the metaphysical fact (known only\\n', 'to God) is beyond my ken. Analogously to both the epistemic achievements and\\n', 'limitations of sensitive knowledge, I have the utmost psychological certainty that\\n', 'I exist in every moment, but that knowledge does not stand up to a second-order\\n', 'normative challenge.\\n', '\\n', 'Having shown the role consciousness plays in Locke’s account of personal identity,\\n', 'I now want to turn to the role it plays in his account of moral agency and more\\n', 'specifically in his account of freedom and moral motivation. First, that we are able to\\n', 'exercise moral agency is tied to the fact that we are the kind of self-conscious beings we\\n', 'are, namely beings with an intellectual nature conscious of pleasure and pain, and so\\n', 'concerned for our own true happiness. In addition, as we have seen only briefly,\\n', 'consciousness as intrinsic to every perception of an idea allows that we can experience\\n', 'unity of consciousness, that is, experience ourselves as extended into the past. Such an\\n', 'experience affords us the opportunity to see past thoughts and actions as ours and\\n', 'thus to be morally accountable for them. But also Locke thinks we experience\\n', 'ourselves as extending into the future. That we experience unity of consciousness in\\n', 'this direction allows us to exercise our agency in the pursuit of long-term happiness,\\n', 'namely the kind of happiness suitable to a moral being.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '5\\n', 'Consciousness and Moral\\n', 'Motivation\\n', 'Along with its importance in Locke’s philosophical psychology and his theories of\\n', 'knowledge and personal identity, consciousness plays a significant role in Locke’s\\n', 'account of moral agency. It does so in two ways. First, as we saw in the last chapter,\\n', 'taking responsibility for the actions of a past self requires that we are able to see a past\\n', 'self as the same as a present self. But also, as I argue toward the end of this chapter, in\\n', 'order to be properly motivated to pursue that which brings the most pleasure, or\\n', 'happiness, we must be able to see ourselves as extending into the future: we must\\n', 'have an experience of a future self. Consciousness as a self-referential awareness\\n', 'internal to any mental act allows for these experiences of diachronic unity of\\n', 'consciousness. Second, along with its role in our experience of past and future selves,\\n', 'consciousness is crucial to Locke’s account of moral agency in another important\\n', 'way. Moral agency, for Locke, requires that we are free enough to deliberate ration-\\n', 'ally about competing goods. We must be able to suspend a particular desire to assess\\n', 'whether or not it really does lead to pleasure (rather than pain) in the longer term.\\n', '\\n', 'But the suspension of desire necessary to Locke’s account of moral agency requires\\n', 'some sort of motivation. I argue that that motivation comes from a natural concern\\n', 'we have for our own true happiness that is grounded in the fact that we are the kind\\n', 'of self-conscious beings that we are—intellectual beings conscious of their own\\n', 'pleasures and pains. This latter argument, establishing the motivating power of our\\n', 'concern for true happiness, is the primary focus of this chapter and to what I will turn\\n', 'first. As is well known, in response to concerns expressed by Molyneux and others\\n', 'about his original account of moral action, Locke revised his view significantly for the\\n', 'second edition of the Essay. In what follows, I will be considering only the account of\\n', 'moral agency and motivation as we find it in the second through fifth editions.\\n', '\\n', 'Locke’s theory of moral motivation is grounded in our natural responses to feelings\\n', 'of pleasure and pain. Feelings of pain lead to desires, which move the will to act to\\n', 'attain the objects of those desires. Attaining those objects, what Locke calls “absent\\n', 'goods,” results in pleasure—the alleviation of pain. What is more, “Happiness . . . in its\\n', 'full extent is the utmost Pleasure we are capable of, and Misery the utmost Pain: And\\n', 'the lowest degree of what can be called Happiness, is so much ease from all Pain, . . . as\\n', 'without which any one cannot be content” (II.xxi.42). Locke links our natural\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'motivation to alleviate pain to our physical self-preservation. He writes of “the Wisdom\\n', 'and Goodness of our Maker, who designing the preservation of our being, has annexed\\n', 'Pain to the application of many things to our Bodies, to warn us of the harm they will do;\\n', 'and as advices to withdraw from them” (II.vii.4). Such motivation to physical preser-\\n', 'vation is a way in which we are naturally constructed, helping to put us on the path to\\n', 'happiness rather than misery. Indeed, Locke thinks that were we not naturally able to\\n', 'avoid things that lead to our own demise, we would be “created miserable.”1\\n', 'In this chapter, I argue that just as we have a natural drive toward our own physical\\n', 'self-preservation here and now, we also have a natural drive toward our long-term\\n', 'preservation, what Locke calls our “true” or “real” happiness, which consists in\\n', 'attaining the most pleasure in this life and the next. To attain long-term happiness,\\n', 'though, we must be able to choose greater goods, including those that might make us\\n', 'suffer now but bring more pleasure later. And doing that requires that we have the\\n', 'freedom to forbear acting on a present desire. Locke thinks that we do have such\\n', 'freedom, for we are able to suspend desire in order to deliberate over the relative\\n', 'pleasures of competing goods. In Locke’s moral theory, this means we can consider\\n', 'our actions insofar as they compare to laws, conferring on us moral agency and moral\\n', 'responsibility. But only desire moves the will to an action, so there must be a desire\\n', 'that results in the suspension of desire. The scholarship has been generally satisfied\\n', 'with attributing this motivation to a desire for happiness in general, but there is little\\n', 'agreement with respect to how to interpret it. Chappell (2000: 242), for example,\\n', 'argues that the desire for happiness in general moves the will to suspend desire: “this\\n', 'desire constitutes a constant and unalterable spur to the will, a source of motivation\\n', 'over and above that which is made up of the sundry particular uneasinesses that fill\\n', 'our daily lives.” Yaffe (2000: 57) grounds what he calls the “Elusive Something,”\\n', 'namely that which grounds any liberty “worth the name” in the desire for happiness\\n', 'in general, which pursuit he understands as not only choosing the good, “but to track\\n', 'the good, to be ‘tied’ to the good no matter where it lies.” Bolton (2008: 262)\\n', 'considers the desire for happiness in general an “innate conative principle” by virtue\\n', 'of which “Locke’s theory gives everyone a motive to inquire about the prospect of\\n', 'happiness or misery after death” in an argument establishing the way in which Locke\\n', 'sees the difference between moral and cognitive duties. LoLordo (2012: 59) takes a\\n', 'more agnostic view, arguing that the “most plausible conclusion is that Locke simply\\n', 'does not know what, if anything, causes suspension.” Schouls (1992: 145) argues that\\n', 'the will to suspend desire is not “to be explained through the kind of uneasiness that\\n', '1 I am interpreting Locke’s understanding of what it means to be “created miserable” somewhat loosely.\\n', '\\n', 'Although Locke uses the term only with reference to being punished for actions that we cannot attribute to ourselves, he also says, “And to receive Pleasure or Pain; i.e. Reward or Punishment, on the account of any such Action, is all one, as to be made happy or miserable in its first being, without any demerit at all . . . what difference is there between that Punishment, and being created miserable?” (II.xxvii.26).\\n', '\\n', 'I take this to mean more generally that being in a state in which we cannot but receive pain or misery through no fault of our own, say, because God has not fitted us with what we need to attain happiness (or avoid misery), is the same as “to be made happy or miserable in its first being.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'would make these acts manifestations of the mechanism of nature.” Stuart (2013:\\n', '473) provides a detailed account of the two views in the scholarship as well as good\\n', 'textual evidence that although at times Locke might have seemed to lean toward\\n', 'incompatibilism, “All told, there is little evidence that Locke took himself to have\\n', 'offered a solution to the problem of freedom and determinism, and even less that he\\n', 'saw our capacity to suspend the prosecution of desires as a way of resisting incorp-\\n', 'oration into the mechanism of nature.”2\\n', 'Unfortunately, Locke seems not to provide us much explicit help with answering\\n', 'the question of what causes suspension. But he does say, “Whatever necessity\\n', 'determines to the pursuit of real Bliss, the same necessity, with the same force\\n', 'establishes suspence, deliberation, and scrutiny of each successive desire, whether\\n', 'the satisfaction of it, does not interfere with our true happiness, and mislead us from\\n', 'it” (II.xxi.52). I argue that this necessity, the motivation to pursue “real Bliss”—the\\n', 'same force that establishes the suspension of a desire—is a natural motivation, which\\n', 'Locke often calls our “concern” for our own true happiness.\\n', '\\n', 'To make my case, I will begin, in section 5.1, by drawing out the analogy between\\n', 'present self-preservation and long-term preservation. Section 5.2 argues that even\\n', 'though what is good just is what brings pleasure, Locke distinguishes between pleasure\\n', 'and what he calls “true” happiness, which culminates, ultimately, in an afterlife. In\\n', 'section 5.3, I argue that the motivation to pursue true happiness grounds the freedom\\n', 'Locke thinks is necessary to having moral agency. I also argue that this motivation\\n', 'Locke often calls our “concern” or “concernment” that we gain true happiness. In\\n', 'section 5.4, I tie together consciousness, concern, and moral agency by arguing that\\n', 'the concern for our happiness generally, that it is “true” happiness, is linked to the fact\\n', 'that we are the kind of self-conscious beings we are—that is, beings conscious of their\\n', 'own pleasure and pain, but also with an intellectual nature and so capable of moral\\n', 'agency. I then show, in section 5.5, the importance of the unity of consciousness in\\n', 'Locke’s account of moral agency. Finally, in the last section, I explain why animals,\\n', 'even though conscious (and even self-conscious) for Locke, fail to be moral agents.\\n', '\\n', '5.1 Motivation, Self-Preservation, and Happiness\\n', 'Locke divides the mind into “two great and principal Actions . . . : Perception, or\\n', 'Thinking, and Volition, or Willing. The Power of Thinking is called the Understand-\\n', 'ing, and the Power of Volition is called the Will” (II.vi.2).3 Although Locke uses the\\n', 'language of “faculties” to talk about both the understanding and the will, he warns us\\n', '2 See Walsh (2014: 150) for an analysis of the suspension of desire as a passive power resulting from\\n', '“contradictory information: the promise of pleasure from the present perception combined with uncertainty about the good’s relation to true happiness from remembered information about the good.”\\n', '3 As mention earlier, all acts of the will are conscious: “[C]onsciousness . . . is inseparable from thinking, and it seems to me essential to it. . . . When we see, hear, smell, taste, feel, meditate, or will any thing, we know that we do so” (II.xxvii.9, my emphasis).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'that he does not mean by “faculty” what most take it to mean. Talk of “faculties,” he\\n', 'says, “has misled many into a confused Notion of so many distinct Agents in us,\\n', 'which had their several Provinces and Authorities, and did command, obey, and\\n', 'perform several Actions, as so many distinct Beings” (II.xxi.6). Rather, Locke sees\\n', 'both the understanding and the will as a power or ability, the exercise of which is\\n', 'perception, or perceiving, and volition, or willing. Locke’s II.xxi. chapter On Power,\\n', 'among other things, contains his theory of action. Actions require, or are at least\\n', 'accompanied by, prior volitions. Locke acknowledges that it is hard to explain exactly\\n', 'what volition is, but if we look to what we do when we will, we might use the terms,\\n', '“Ordering, Directing, Chusing, Preferring” (II.xxi.15). But he is quick to admit that\\n', 'none of these terms perfectly captures it. For example, someone might prefer to fly\\n', 'rather than to walk, but it cannot be the case that anyone actually wills flying over\\n', 'walking. In general, though, Locke thinks the following is the best description of\\n', 'volition, or willing: “Volition, . . . [is] an Act of the Mind knowingly exerting that\\n', 'Dominion it takes itself to have over any part of the Man, by imploying it in, or\\n', 'withholding it from any particular Action” (II.xxi.15). It is whatever we do when we\\n', 'move from thinking about doing something to actually doing it (or not doing it).4\\n', 'What activates the will such that we are moved to pursue an action? Only desire, or\\n', 'what Locke also calls “uneasiness,” moves the will:5\\n', 'To return then to the Enquiry, what is it that determines the Will in regard to our Actions? And\\n', 'that upon second thoughts I am apt to imagine is not, as is generally supposed, the greater good\\n', 'in view: But some (and for the most part pressing) uneasiness a Man is at present under. This is\\n', 'that which successively determines the Will, and sets us upon those Actions, we perform. This\\n', 'Uneasiness we may call, as it is, Desire; which is an uneasiness of the Mind for want of some\\n', 'absent good. All pain of the body of what sort soever, and disquiet of the mind, is uneasiness:\\n', 'And with this is always join’d Desire, equal to the pain or uneasiness felt; and is scarce\\n', 'distinguishable from it. For desire being nothing but an uneasiness in the want of an absent\\n', 'good, in reference to any pain felt, ease is that absent good; and till that ease be attained, we\\n', 'may call it desire, no body feeling pain, that he wishes not to be erased of, with a desire equal to that pain, and inseparable from it.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.31)\\n', 'How to distinguish desire from uneasiness is not readily clear. Locke will sometimes\\n', 'speak of desire and uneasiness as if they are the same and sometimes as if they are\\n', 'different. I think the above passage makes the distinction. Uneasiness, I take to be\\n', 'equivalent to pain. When we have uneasiness, we have pain. When the pain is associated\\n', 'with an absent good, namely something perceived to alleviate the pain and thus restore\\n', 'us to a state of ease, we have a desire. Desires, then, are always connected with some\\n', 'specific absent good.\\n', '\\n', '4 Notice Locke’s statement that when we will, we know that we do. I suggest that this is a similar use of the term ‘know’ as we find in II.xxvii.9, when Locke equates consciousness with knowing.\\n', '\\n', '5 That uneasiness moves the will to an action is one of the main revisions from the first-edition to the second-edition account of moral agency.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'One might, however, see the distinction somewhat differently. Uneasiness would be\\n', 'the genus of which pain is a species. That is, uneasinesses come in a spectrum, with pain\\n', 'at the painful end of that spectrum. Although I am open to the suggestion, I am not sure\\n', 'that is what Locke has in mind for the following reasons. First, when Locke first\\n', 'mentions our simple ideas of pleasure and pain, he lists them in the following way:\\n', '“Pleasure, or Delight, and its opposite Pain, or Uneasiness” (II.vii.1). Here Locke seems\\n', 'to be using the “or” in both cases appositively, which signals equivalence. Second, Locke\\n', 'says, “Delight, or Uneasiness, one or other of them join themselves to almost all our\\n', 'Ideas, both of Sensation and Reflection: And there is scarce any affection of our Senses\\n', 'from without, any retired thought of our Mind within, which is not able to produce in us\\n', 'pleasure or pain” (II.vii.2). Given that virtually all our ideas come with some sort of\\n', 'pleasure or pain, Locke seems to be using “pain” to designate “uneasiness” as opposed to\\n', 'the narrower category of uneasinesses that are truly painful. And although Locke goes\\n', 'on to list what appears to be gradations of pleasures and pains when he says, “For\\n', 'whether we call it Satisfaction, Delight, Pleasure, Happiness, etc. on the one side; or\\n', 'Uneasiness, Trouble, Pain, Torment, Anguish, Misery, etc. on the other,” he seems again\\n', 'to equate “pain” with “uneasiness” when he continues the sentence with “they are still\\n', 'but different degrees of the same thing, and belong to the Ideas of Pleasure and Pain,\\n', 'Delight or Uneasiness; which are the Names I shall most commonly use for those two\\n', 'sorts of Ideas” (II.vii.2). Interesting as the question is, I do not think anything in my\\n', 'coming arguments hangs on which interpretation one chooses.\\n', '\\n', 'Even though desires are always connected with an absent good, Locke also admits\\n', 'that we can consider an absent good without feeling uneasy. We will not feel any\\n', 'uneasiness as long as we are content with what we are doing or with what we have\\n', '(or do not have):\\n', 'When a Man is perfectly content with the State he is in, which is when he is perfectly without\\n', 'any uneasiness, what industry, what action, what Will is there left, but to continue in it? Of this every Man’s observation will satisfy him. (II.xxi.34)\\n', 'If it is natural to continue an action as long as it brings pleasure, then one might want\\n', 'to ask why we would ever discontinue a pleasurable activity. Locke answers:\\n', 'And thus we see our All-wise Maker, suitable to our constitution and frame, and knowing what\\n', 'it is that determines the Will, has put into man the uneasiness of hunger and thirst, and other\\n', 'natural desires, that return at their Seasons, to move and determine their Wills, for the\\n', 'preservation of themselves, and the continuation of their species.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.34)\\n', 'Even when we are presently content with what we are doing, natural desires like\\n', 'hunger and thirst, as well as what else is necessary for our physical preservation,\\n', 'interrupt us to provide the requisite motivation to change course. So, regardless of\\n', 'how much at ease I am when engaged in any particular activity, eventually the\\n', 'natural demands of preservation will kick in: I experience the pain of hunger or\\n', 'the need for something to drink. God has designed me such that pains arise from\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'within my body to push me to pursue an absent greater good—continued physical\\n', 'preservation. We see this also in Locke’s account of the natural annexation of\\n', 'pleasures and pains to sensations:\\n', 'the Wisdom and Goodness of our Maker, who designing the preservation of our being, has\\n', 'annexed Pain to the application of many things to our Bodies, to warn us of the harm they will\\n', 'do; and as advices to withdraw from them.\\n', '\\n', '(II.vii.4)\\n', 'Which is wisely and favourably so ordered by Nature, that when any Object does, by the\\n', 'vehemency of its operation, disorder the instruments of Sensation, whose Structures cannot\\n', 'but be very nice and delicate, we might by the pain, be warned to withdraw, before the Organ\\n', 'be quite put out of order, and so be unfitted for its proper functions for the future. (II.vii.4)6\\n', 'These passages confirm that we have a natural motivation to change course when our\\n', 'physical preservation is threatened. When I look up to the sky, if the light is too\\n', 'bright, I am naturally moved to a different action: to stop looking at the sun. We are\\n', 'naturally moved from that which causes pain to that which alleviates it, or toward\\n', 'that which brings pleasure.\\n', '\\n', 'I suggest that Locke can be seen to have a similar naturalistic explanation of how\\n', 'we can be moved to pursue goods other than those necessary for the present\\n', 'preservation of the body. Consider, first, this passage:\\n', 'Let a Man never be so well perswaded of the advantages of virtue, that it is as necessary to a\\n', 'Man, who has any great aims in this World, or hopes in the next, as food to life: yet till he\\n', 'hungers and thirsts after righteousness; till he feels an uneasiness in the want of it, his will will not be determin’d to any action in pursuit of this confessed greater good; but any other\\n', 'uneasinesses he feels in himself, shall take place, and carry his will to other actions.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.35)\\n', 'Locke’s point is that mere persuasion that a virtuous life is better is not enough to\\n', 'motivate us to choose it. How, then, do we come to experience the uneasiness\\n', 'necessary to cause a change in a present state or manner of living, say, from a non-\\n', 'virtuous to a virtuous life? Locke answers this question with an allusion to those\\n', 'natural pains/uneasinesses leading to the preservation of the body. Virtue, he says, is\\n', 'as necessary to a good life in this world and a better one in the next as food is to the\\n', 'preservation of present physical life. We have to “hunger and thirst” after righteous-\\n', 'ness. We have to feel the pain that the absence of righteousness brings about, just as\\n', 'we hunger and thirst after bodily sustenance, namely feel the uneasiness that the\\n', 'absence of food and water brings about. In other words, virtue is necessary to our\\n', 'long-term happiness in this life and the next, just as food and water are necessary to\\n', 'our preservation here and now.7\\n', '6 See also II.vii.4: “But yet excess of Cold, as well as of Heat, pains us: because it is equally destructive to that temper, which is necessary to the preservation of life, and the exercise of the several functions of the Body, and which consists in a moderate degree of warmth; or if you please in the insensible parts of our Bodies, confin’d within certain bounds.”\\n', '7 See also Chappell (2000), Flage (2000), and Bolton (2008).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'This argument may invite the objection that Locke uses “virtue” and “vice” to refer\\n', 'only to the keeping of those “Law[s] of Opinion or Reputation,” that are relative to\\n', '“Societies, Tribes, and Clubs of Men in the World” (II.xxviii.10). I suggest, though,\\n', 'that Locke actually distinguishes real virtue and vice from what in different societies\\n', 'is countenanced by laws of reputation as virtue and vice. He says, “Vertue and Vice\\n', 'are Names pretended, and supposed every where to stand for actions in their own\\n', 'nature right and wrong: And as far as they really are so applied, they so far are\\n', 'co-incident with the divine Law above-mentioned” (II.xxviii.10). What Locke seems\\n', 'to be saying is that we normally use the terms “virtue” and “vice” as if they denoted\\n', 'objective determinations of right and wrong actions. But really they stand only for\\n', 'what any particular society deems right and wrong actions. In the last part of\\n', 'the passage, though, Locke admits that one correctly uses “virtue” and “vice” to\\n', 'stand for what is objectively right and wrong when those terms describe actions\\n', 'that are “co-incident with divine Law.” So, Locke must be thinking that there is a way\\n', 'to talk about virtue and vice that is not relative to the laws of reputation of a\\n', 'particular society.\\n', '\\n', 'I suggest Locke is doing just that in the passage cited from II.xxi.35 above and also\\n', 'in this passage from II.xxi.70:\\n', 'He that will allow exquisite and endless Happiness to be but the consequence of a good Life\\n', 'here, and the contrary state the possible Reward of a bad one, must own himself to judge very\\n', 'much amiss, if he does not conclude, That a virtuous Life, with the certain expectation of\\n', 'everlasting Bliss, which may come, is to be preferred to a vicious one, with the fear of that\\n', 'dreadful state of Misery, which ’tis very possible may overtake the guilty; or at best the terrible uncertain hope of Annihilation.\\n', '\\n', 'Colman (2003: 122–3) argues somewhat similarly. First, he cites the following\\n', 'passage from II.xxviii.11. “Men . . . did not for the most part much vary from the\\n', 'Law of Nature, which is that standing and unalterable Rule, by which they ought to\\n', 'judge the moral rectitude and pravity of their actions, and accordingly denominate\\n', 'them Vertues or Vices.” He then explains,\\n', 'Here and in other places Locke’s talk of the law of reputation and the divine law (revealed or\\n', 'law of nature) suggests two distinct standards of morality which may in some particular\\n', 'coincide in their content, so that what counts as a virtuous or a vicious act according to the\\n', 'one may similarly so count as the other. Locke may, however, be read somewhat differently, as\\n', 'concerned with how persons see the precepts of morality. Those who assess their actions in\\n', 'terms of the law of reputation see these precepts as what is socially approved or disapproved,\\n', 'and share society’s approval or disapproval. Those who assess them in terms of the divine law\\n', 'see moral precepts as the law of God. The heathen philosopher perceives morality in the\\n', 'former of these ways, the Christian in the latter.\\n', '\\n', '(Colman, 2003: 123)\\n', 'The reason why the two judgments will not vary so much is that “nothing can be more\\n', 'rational, than to encourage with Esteem and Reputation that, wherein every one finds\\n', 'his Advantage; and to blame and discountenance the contrary” (II.xxviii.11). To see\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'virtue and vice as not confined to the following of laws of reputation, therefore, is fully\\n', 'consistent with Locke’s understanding of it. I am also very sympathetic to the view\\n', 'that, for Locke, a virtuous life is one lived according to reason. Not that I would equate\\n', 'virtue with rationality, but certainly rationality is a virtue that leads to happiness\\n', 'rather than misery. Rationality allows us to determine which actions are commen-\\n', 'surate with law and which are not.\\n', '\\n', 'To return to the analogy Locke seems to be drawing, just as we need to preserve\\n', 'ourselves physically here and now with, say, food and water, we need to preserve ourselves\\n', 'in the longer term (including in an afterlife) by pursuing virtue, which I take to be\\n', 'choosing those actions that bring the most happiness, those commensurate with law,\\n', 'and most importantly with divine law. Because Locke thinks that only the just are\\n', 'preserved in an afterlife, where the wicked are extinguished, we can also see the\\n', 'analogy in this way: Just as we are naturally driven to avoid present bodily deterior-\\n', 'ation and premature death, we also are naturally driven to avoid longer-term pains\\n', 'and punishments and eventual annihilation.8 So, in both cases, were we not motivated\\n', 'to that which preserves us, we would not be in a position to attain happiness, which “in\\n', 'its full extent,” Locke explains, “is the utmost Pleasure we are capable of ” (II.xxi.42).\\n', '\\n', 'But for the analogy to go through there must be a natural motivation to choose a\\n', 'greater good leading to most happiness (perhaps even in an afterlife), just as there is a\\n', 'natural motivation to choose what leads to continued physical health.\\n', '\\n', 'In his arguments against innate practical knowledge, Locke admits that we do have\\n', 'one innate action-guiding principle: “Nature, I confess, has put into Man a desire for\\n', 'Happiness, and an aversion to Misery: These indeed are innate practical Principles,\\n', 'which (as practical Principles ought) do continue to operate and influence all our\\n', 'Actions without ceasing” (I.iii.3). That we are so naturally motivated in the direction\\n', 'of longer-term (future) happiness is suggested in the next passage:\\n', 'Beyond all this [pains naturally annexed to objects dangerous to our bodily preservation], we\\n', 'may find another reason why God hath scattered up and down several degrees of Pleasure and\\n', 'Pain, in all the things that environ and affect us; and blended them together, in almost all that\\n', 'our Thoughts and Senses have to do with; that we finding imperfection, dissatisfaction, and\\n', 'want of complete happiness, in all the Enjoyments which the Creatures can afford us, might be\\n', 'led to seek it in the enjoyment of him, with whom there is fullness of joy, and at whose right\\n', 'hand are the pleasures for evermore.\\n', '\\n', '(II.vii.5)\\n', '8 Locke (2002: 234) argues that it is more consistent with scripture that only the just are resurrected to everlasting life, where as the wicked receive death. Indeed, Locke thinks it is a convenient fiction to think that the wicked enjoy an afterlife, even one filled with torment and misery. He says, “The constant language of Scripture in the whole current of the new testament as well as the old is life to the just, to believers, to the obedient; & death to the wicked and unbelievers that one would wonder how the readers could be mistaken when death is threatened soe constantly & declared every where to be the ultimate punishment & last estate to which the wicked must all come. To salve this they have invented a very odd signification of the word death which they would have stand for eternal life in torment.” I thank Jessica Gordon-Roth for pushing me to think more about this work of Locke’s.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Here Locke seems to say that one reason God has seen fit to blend pleasures and\\n', 'pains with all those things that affect us is so that we will experience the dissatisfac-\\n', 'tion (or feeling of uneasiness) that comes from the happiness we are still missing.\\n', '\\n', 'Thus, we are created such that not only are we always naturally seeking the happiness\\n', 'that comes from the preservation of our lives here and now, but also we are naturally\\n', 'seeking to attain “complete” happiness culminating in our preservation with God in\\n', 'the next life, “with whom there is fullness of joy, and at whose right hand are the\\n', 'pleasures for evermore.” Therefore, Locke seems to think we are created such that we\\n', 'have a natural motivation to pursue those goods leading to longer-term “complete”\\n', 'happiness.9\\n', '5.2 Motivation to Pursue Greater Goods\\n', 'To understand the nature of our motivation to pursue “complete” (II.vii.5), “true”\\n', '(II.xxi.53), or “real” (II.xxi.51) happiness, we will need to back up a minute to see\\n', 'whether we can, and if so how we can, pursue a greater good, say, one that leads to\\n', 'greater pleasure in the longer term. Let us begin with Locke’s account of motivation\\n', 'generally. With respect to any good, greater or not, “I am sure,” says Locke, “where-\\n', 'ever there is uneasiness there is desire: For we constantly desire happiness; and\\n', 'whatever we feel of uneasiness, so much, ’tis certain, we want of happiness”\\n', '(II.xxi.39).10 So, happiness (in its full extent the utmost pleasure) is the removal of\\n', 'pain or uneasiness and what we desire most and constantly.11\\n', 'Locke also thinks, as mentioned above, that we are always looking to continue\\n', 'whatever pleasure we currently enjoy.\\n', '\\n', 'Besides, the present moment not being our eternity, whatever our enjoyment be, we look\\n', 'beyond the present, and desire goes with our foresight, and that still carries the will with it. So that even in joy it self, that which keeps up the action, whereon the enjoyment depends, is the\\n', 'desire to continue it, and fear to lose it.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.39)\\n', 'A pleasure lost is experienced as pain. Therefore, we are moved to will an action that\\n', 'continues our pleasure as long as the pleasure lasts, which is either its complete\\n', 'duration or just as long as our attention is not drawn away by an interfering pain. For\\n', 'example, I will continue eating the chocolate cake in front of me until it is gone or\\n', 'until I feel the pain of a full stomach, a pang of guilt, or some other intervening\\n', 'uneasiness. Consistent with my “desire following my foresight,” I may even begin to\\n', '9 Locke continues in II.vii.6 by explaining that God’s annexation of pleasures and pains to particular things in different ways and degrees helps us along the path to achieving that which brings most happiness:\\n', '“the knowledge and veneration of Him, being the chief end of all of our Thoughts, and the proper business of all Understanding.”\\n', '10 See also II.xxi.43: “Happiness . . . every one constantly pursues, and desires what makes any part of it.”\\n', '11 “So the greatest Happiness consists, in having those things, which produce the greatest Pleasure; and in the absence of those, which cause any disturbance, any pain” (II.xxi.55).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'eat more slowly in order to extend my pleasure farther into the future (or, what is the\\n', 'same, put off the pain of having no more cake for as long as possible).\\n', '\\n', 'Locke continues his analysis by telling us that whatever brings pleasure is good and\\n', 'whatever brings pain is evil. But that does not mean that goods cannot be compared\\n', 'or measured against one another, such that a greater one wins out:\\n', 'Farther, though what is apt to produce any degree of Pleasure, be in it self good; and what is apt\\n', 'to produce any degree of Pain, be evil; yet it often happens, that we do not call it so, when it\\n', 'comes in competition with a greater of its sort; because when they come in competition the\\n', 'degrees also of Pleasure and Pain have justly a preference. So that if we will rightly estimate\\n', 'what we call Good and Evil, we shall find it lies much in comparison: For the cause of every less\\n', 'degree of Pain, as well as every greater degree of Pleasure has the nature of good, and vice versa.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.43)\\n', 'Indeed, when it comes to comparing the pleasures of competing goods, it makes a lot\\n', 'of difference what we are presently experiencing. Often what happens is that a\\n', 'present pain will easily trump the promise of a future pleasure, so that we have\\n', 'neither the time nor the inclination to pursue more goods or those other than what\\n', 'demands our immediate attention. If we spend most of our time working for food\\n', 'and shelter, namely avoiding the pains of hunger and cold, then we have not much\\n', 'time or interest to pursue other sorts of pleasures, say, those to be gained from more\\n', 'leisured activities.\\n', '\\n', 'And even if we are able to consider greater pleasures, we do not necessarily pursue\\n', 'them. “This, I think, any one may observe in himself, and others, that the greater\\n', 'visible good does not always raise Men’s desires in proportion to the greatness, it\\n', 'appears, and is acknowledged to have: Though every little trouble moves us, and sets\\n', 'us on work to get rid of it” (II.xxi.44). Because our happiness comes mostly from\\n', 'alleviating pain, and we are constantly bombarded with sundry pains of varying\\n', 'degrees, we are much too busy with those pains to generate equally forceful, or even\\n', 'at times any, desires for greater goods. “The reason whereof,” explains Locke, “is\\n', 'evident from the nature of our happiness and misery it self. All present pain, whatever\\n', 'it be, makes a part of our present misery: But all absent good does not at any time\\n', 'make a necessary part of our present happiness, nor the absence of it make a part of\\n', 'our misery” (II.xxi.44). Locke continues:\\n', 'We are seldom at ease, and free enough from the sollicitation of our natural or adopted desires,\\n', 'but a constant succession of uneasinesses out of that stock, which natural wants, or acquired\\n', 'habits have heaped up, take the will in their turns; and no sooner is one action dispatch’d,\\n', 'which by such a determination of the will we are set upon, but another uneasiness is ready to\\n', 'set us on work. For the removing of the pains we feel, and are at present pressed with, being the\\n', 'getting out of misery, and consequently the first thing to be done in order to happiness, absent\\n', 'good, though thought on, confessed, and appearing to be good, not making any part of this\\n', 'unhappiness in its absence, is jostled out, to make way for the removal of those uneasinesses we\\n', '[currently] feel.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.45)\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Extirpating present pains takes precedence over ensuring a future greater good, and\\n', 'since we cannot avoid the onslaught of present pains, whether natural bodily\\n', 'demands or acquired desires we have become accustomed to assuaging, we are in a\\n', 'sense not free to develop desires for future greater goods.\\n', '\\n', 'Furthermore, even though we all tend toward happiness, different people experi-\\n', 'ence pleasures differently, which means that happiness is not necessarily achieved by\\n', 'pursuing the same pleasures:\\n', 'The Mind has a different relish, as well as the Palate; and you will as fruitlessly endeavour to\\n', 'delight all Men with Riches or Glory, (which yet some Men place their Happiness in,) as you\\n', 'would satisfy all Men’s Hunger with Cheese or Lobsters; which, though very agreeable and\\n', 'delicious fare to some, are to others extremely nauseous and offensive.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.55)\\n', 'Thus, what pleasures strike us as greater depends on the idiosyncracies of our palates\\n', 'and on our present circumstances. As Locke says:\\n', 'This I think may serve to show us the Reason, why, though all Men’s desires tend to Happiness,\\n', 'yet they are not moved by the same Object. Men may chuse different things, and yet all chuse\\n', 'right, supposing them only like a Company of poor Insects, whereof some are Bees, delighted\\n', 'with Flowers, and their sweetness; others, Beetles, delighted with other kinds of Viands; which\\n', 'having enjoyed for a season, they should cease to be, and exist no more for ever.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.55)\\n', 'Locke is suggesting that although we are all moved toward that which individually\\n', 'brings pleasure, and all pleasure is good, we always choose correctly which good to\\n', 'pursue only “supposing we are a Company of poor Insects.” I take this to mean that\\n', 'one difference between insects and us is that we do not always choose correctly, even\\n', 'if we attain the pleasure we desire. Under the supposition that we are not insects, we\\n', 'are able to compare goods in terms of the pleasures they promise instead of flitting\\n', 'from one to another depending on what delights us in the moment. Thus, we are able\\n', 'to pursue greater goods. How are we able to do that?\\n', '\\n', 'To start, Locke distinguishes present apparent happiness from true or real\\n', 'happiness:\\n', 'But the forbearance of a too hasty compliance with our desires, the moderation and restraint of\\n', 'our Passions, so that our Understandings may be free to examine, and reason unbiased give its\\n', 'judgment, being that, whereon a right direction of our conduct to true Happiness depends; ’tis\\n', 'in this we should employ our chief care and endeavours. In this we should take pains to suit the\\n', 'relish of our Minds to the true intrinsick good or ill, that is in things; and not permit an allow’d or supposed possible great and weighty good to slip out of our thoughts, without leaving any\\n', 'relish, any desire of it self there, till, by due consideration of its true worth, we have formed\\n', 'appetites in our Minds suitable to it.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.53)\\n', 'First, there is a “true intrinsic good or ill” to be gained from pursuing particular\\n', 'things, which is distinguished from what is only apparently good or ill. Second,\\n', '“taking care” to make sure our actions comply with an unbiased judgment of what is\\n', 'truly good or ill puts us in the direction of “true Happiness.” Third, thinking about a\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', '“great and weighty [true] good” can result in a “relish” or desire for that good where\\n', 'no desire previously existed. And fourth, if we “take pains” to work at it, we have the\\n', 'ability to “suit our Minds” to relish or desire that which has “true worth” over that\\n', 'which presents itself as only appearing so. Hence, even though what brings us\\n', 'pleasure is up to us, and what brings pleasure is good, Locke still thinks some\\n', 'pleasures have “true worth” where others do not.\\n', '\\n', 'I suggest that we can see pleasures having true worth as those best ensuring the\\n', 'greatest happiness, which is achieved in two ways. First, insofar as we are beings who feel\\n', 'immediate pleasures and pains, we can achieve happiness by doing that which ensures\\n', 'our physical preservation here and now. Second, insofar as we are beings interested in\\n', 'longer-term pleasures and pains, we can achieve happiness by doing that which really\\n', 'does bring the most pleasure in the longer term. And because we are able to weigh\\n', 'competing pleasures (we are not a company of insects), we are able to will actions that\\n', 'result in pleasures having true worth. Locke seems to confirm as much here:\\n', 'To him, I say, who hath a prospect of the different state of perfect Happiness or Misery, that\\n', 'attends all Men after this Life, depending on their Behaviour here, the measures of Good and\\n', 'Evil, that govern his choice, are mightily changed. For since nothing of Pleasure and Pain in\\n', 'this Life, can bear any proportion to endless Happiness, or exquisite Misery of an immortal\\n', 'Soul hereafter, Actions in his Power will have their preference, not in according to transient\\n', 'Pleasure, or Pain that accompanies, or follows them here; but as they serve to secure that\\n', 'perfect durable Happiness hereafter.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.60)\\n', 'And even though having the most pleasure, ultimately, will come from the eternal\\n', 'happiness in our preservation in an afterlife, all of our actions can be considered in\\n', 'light of whether or not they conduce to bringing about the most pleasure. That is, all\\n', 'of our actions can be considered insofar as they bring true happiness, even though\\n', 'what we choose would make no difference to our eternal reward.\\n', '\\n', 'Why, then, do we not always will what brings true happiness when the choice does\\n', 'make a difference? Locke admits that the mere thought of eternal happiness should\\n', 'move us to do whatever we can in pursuit of it:\\n', 'Were the will determin’d by the views of the good, . . . I do not see how it could ever get loose\\n', 'from the infinite eternal joys of Heaven, once propose’d and consider’d as possible. For all\\n', 'absent good, by which alone barely propos’d, and coming in view, the will is thought to be\\n', 'determin’d, and so to set us on action, being only possible but not infallibly certain, ’tis\\n', 'unavoidable, that the infinitely greater possible good should regularly and constantly deter-\\n', 'mine the will in all the successive actions it directs; and then we should keep constantly and\\n', 'steadily in our course towards Heaven, without ever standing still, or directing our actions to\\n', 'any other end.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.38)\\n', 'Were we constructed such that the mere contemplation of a good is sufficient to\\n', 'move the will, then the simple thought of eternal happiness would keep us steadily\\n', 'willing those actions that ensure it. But even though we have all we need, we are not\\n', 'so naturally constructed; only uneasiness moves the will. Locke admits that even\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'when we recognize the possibility of eternal happiness we often do not choose it.\\n', '\\n', 'Experience teaches us that we neglect eternal goods in order to satisfy the successive\\n', 'pains of our desires after “trifles.”12 Indeed, sometimes we experience such severe and\\n', 'constant uneasiness that we are not able even to consider other goods:\\n', 'Thus any vehement pain of the Body; the ungovernable passion of a Man violently in love; or\\n', 'the impatient desire of revenge, keeps the will steady and intent; and the will thus determined\\n', 'never lets the Understanding lay by the object, but all the thoughts of the Mind, and powers of\\n', 'the Body are uninterruptedly employ’d that way, but the determinations of the will, influenced\\n', 'by that topping uneasiness, as long as it lasts; whereby it seems to me evident, that the will, or\\n', 'power of setting us upon one action in preference to all other, is determin’d in us, by\\n', 'uneasiness: and whether this be not so, I desire every one to observe in himself.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.38)\\n', 'Therefore, the goods themselves do not determine the will. Were it so, we would be\\n', 'able to hold our course in the direction of eternal happiness or be able more easily to\\n', 'change course when we are in the throes of violent passions. From these kinds of\\n', 'experiences, Locke concludes that only the pain generated from not having some-\\n', 'thing we want, that is, a desire for it, causes us to will an action toward the attaining\\n', 'of that perceived good. Therefore, only the pain generated from not having true\\n', 'happiness, namely a desire for it, can move the will to actions attaining it.\\n', '\\n', 'On the analogy suggested by Locke earlier, just as there is a natural motivation\\n', 'pushing us in the direction of present preservation (happiness), there must be a\\n', 'natural motivation pushing us in the direction of long-term preservation (happi-\\n', 'ness). A desire for true happiness must be able to present itself to us such that even if\\n', 'we are presently content or in the throes of a violent passion, it changes the course of\\n', 'our direction toward the happiness that comes with long-term preservation, just as a\\n', 'desire for food and water changes our direction toward our present preservation.\\n', '\\n', 'This desire for true happiness must be able to break into the stream of natural and\\n', 'habitual desires, such that it can compete with them and perhaps win with respect to\\n', 'them. By “win,” I mean that the pain of not having true happiness, much like the pain\\n', 'of immediate physical needs, interrupts us and makes possible that the will is\\n', 'redirected to an action better ensuring that we attain that happiness. In the next\\n', 'section, we will see Locke’s account of how the will is naturally so redirected.\\n', '\\n', '5.3 Suspension of Desire and the Pursuit\\n', 'of a Greater Good\\n', 'If what we find pleasurable or painful is in a sense up to us, and things strike us as\\n', 'pleasurable in part in comparison with what we are already experiencing, then how can\\n', '12 In the first edition of the Essay, Locke argued that the greater good itself is sufficient to move the will.\\n', '\\n', 'Given what he found in experience, he revised his view in the second edition: “The infinitely greatest confessed good being often neglected, to satisfy the successive uneasiness of our desires pursuing trifles”\\n', '(II.xxi.38).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'we be naturally motivated to pursue a greater good like virtue rather than vice? Surely\\n', 'virtuous actions often require that we put present pleasure aside altogether or that we\\n', 'postpone a present pleasure for a future one. Interruption of the ongoing chain of desires\\n', 'in order that the will is redirected to a greater good is referred to as Locke’s “suspension\\n', 'of desire thesis.” It is also necessary for Locke’s second sense of liberty—the freedom to\\n', 'act as the result of rational deliberation.13\\n', 'Liberty, Locke initially defines as “the power a Man has to do or forbear doing any\\n', 'particular Action, according as its doing or forbearance has the actual preference in\\n', 'the Mind, which is the same thing as to say, according, as he himself wills it”\\n', '(II.xxi.15). This first sense of liberty is the ability to act or not act in accordance\\n', 'with what we will. But if we are motivated by desire, and desires are raised in us\\n', 'proportionate to the uneasiness we feel in any particular moment, and yet we are able\\n', 'to compare and pursue greater goods, then Locke must have an account of how we\\n', 'are able to resist the force of a present desire. Only so are we able to break into the\\n', 'stream of desires in order to assess rationally what we are about to do, that is, have\\n', 'the second sense of liberty. Moreover, our choices are free enough for moral agency\\n', 'because we are able to step back from a present pressing desire in order to examine\\n', 'rationally how much pleasure is to be gained from a particular action as compared\\n', 'with other actions, namely to figure out which action has “true worth”:\\n', 'There being a great many uneasinesses always solliciting, and ready to determine the will, it is\\n', 'natural, as I have said, that the greatest, and most pressing should determine the will to the next action; and so it does for the most part, but not always. For the mind having in most cases, as is\\n', 'evident in Experience, a power to suspend the execution and satisfaction of any of its desires, and so all, one after another, is at liberty to consider the objects of them; examine them on all sides, and weigh them with others. In this lies the liberty a Man has; and from the not using it right comes all that variety of mistakes, errors, and faults which we run into, in the conduct of our lives, and our endeavours after happiness; whilst we precipitate the determination of our wills, and engage too\\n', 'soon before due Examination. To prevent this we have a power to suspend the prosecution of this\\n', 'or that desire, as every one daily may Experiment in himself. This seems to me the source of all\\n', 'liberty; in this seems to consist that, which is (as I think improperly) call’d Free will. For during this suspension of any desire, before the will be determined to action, and the action (which follows that determination) done, we have opportunity to examine, view, and judge, of the good or evil of what\\n', 'we are going to do; and when, upon due Examination, we have judg’d, we have done our duty, all\\n', 'that we can, or ought to do, in pursuit of our happiness; and ’tis not a fault, but a perfection\\n', 'of our nature to desire, will, and act according to the last result of a fair Examination.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.47)\\n', 'Engaging in the twofold process of suspending a desire and examining the relative\\n', 'pains and pleasures to be gained from alternative actions discharges our moral duty,\\n', '13 Darwall (1995: 51), Chappell (2000: 246–7), Yaffe (2000: 47, 59), Bolton (2008: 262), LoLordo (2012: 46), Walsh (2014: 139). Rickless (2013: 46) argues that suspension of desire is not a different sense of liberty, but rather “the power to suspend is just a special case of the liberty of action.” Although I am using similar language as the foregoing group, I do not see my argument as engaging this debate.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'by helping to ensure that we are able to engage in actions that truly bring the most\\n', 'pleasure in the long run.\\n', '\\n', 'In Locke’s moral theory, actions resulting in the most pleasure are those commen-\\n', 'surate with law, whether divine, civil, or what Locke calls laws of reputation. Actions in\\n', 'accordance with the law avoid the pain of punishment, either by a civil or a divine\\n', 'authority or by one’s social peers. Moreover, good and evil, as we have seen, “are\\n', 'nothing but Pleasure or Pain, or that which occasions, or procures Pleasure or Pain to\\n', 'us.” Locke then distinguishes “Morally Good and Evil . . . [as] the Conformity or\\n', 'Disagreement of our voluntary Actions to some Law, whereby Good or Evil is drawn\\n', 'on us, for the Will and Power of the law-maker is that we call Reward and Punishment”\\n', '(II.xxviii.5). Laws, or what Locke also calls “Moral Rules” (II.xxviii.6), come in three\\n', 'sorts with three different kinds of enforcements, or rewards and punishments: “Divine\\n', 'law,” which is enforced by God (II.xxviii.8); “Civil law,” which is enforced by the\\n', 'commonwealth (II.xxviii.9), and the “Law of Opinion or Reputation,” namely the law\\n', 'of virtue and vice, which is enforced by the condemnation, contempt, and disgrace of\\n', 'one’s companions (II.xxviii.10, II.xxviii.12). Obedience to laws, then, is the most\\n', 'rational way to ensure that our actions lead to most happiness.\\n', '\\n', 'Once we have suspended desire and rationally examined the true worth of an\\n', 'action, the resulting judgment “raises” a desire determining the will in the direction\\n', 'of that which we have rationally concluded brings the most pleasure. “’[T]is not a\\n', 'fault,” Locke says, “but a perfection of our nature to desire, will, and act according to\\n', 'the last result of a fair Examination” (II.xxi.47). Insofar as our choices do not issue\\n', 'from our nature as “thinking, intelligent beings” who naturally desire what they judge\\n', 'best, “the nearer we are,” says Locke, “to Misery and Slavery” (II.xxi.48). That we are\\n', 'able to suspend a desire to act in order to deliberate about the consequences and that\\n', 'the result of the deliberation is the motivation behind what we end up doing are a\\n', 'form of free agency constitutive of the perfection of our nature.\\n', '\\n', 'It is useful to consider briefly two recent interpretations of the role of suspension\\n', 'and deliberation in Locke’s account of freedom. Yaffe (2000: 58) argues that what\\n', 'grounds a full-fledged sense of liberty, liberty that goes beyond actions in accordance\\n', 'with the will, is that we are strongly tied to the pursuit of the good, a non-agent relative\\n', 'good, such that our choices are determined by that good. Suspension of desire and a\\n', 'rational assessment of the happiness to be achieved in any action are “on occasion, the\\n', 'only way for an agent to bring it about that her volitions are determined by the good.\\n', '\\n', 'But it is the having of such strong ties that is the ‘foundation of our liberty’ [II.xxi.51]:\\n', 'it is what there is to liberty, true liberty, beyond the freedom of action.” Being “tied” to\\n', 'the good, which Yaffe (2000: 57) also describes as our volitions “tracking the good\\n', 'wherever it lies,” is to choose the right action—the one leading to the most happiness.\\n', '\\n', 'Moreover, Yaffe (2000: 118) describes this form of liberty as a perfection. He says,\\n', '“Determination of choice by the good is a perfection in the determination of choice.”\\n', 'I take it that when our choices are determined by the good, we are achieving perfection\\n', 'in our choice-making. Notice, though, that Yaffe is interpreting Locke’s understanding\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'of the perfection attained as one in making the right kinds of choices—choices that\\n', 'attain the good. Yaffe (2000: 118) concludes that true liberty, or freedom, for Locke, is\\n', 'a form of self-transcendence. Because our choices are determined by the good, or at\\n', 'least we have the ability to have them determined by the good, we are able to rise above\\n', 'ourselves by “escaping our own parochialisms and biases.” So, it seems that the\\n', 'perfection of our nature as Locke seems to be describing it above is the making of,\\n', 'or the ability to make, choices that track the good as opposed to those that are perhaps\\n', 'influenced by other considerations.\\n', '\\n', 'In objection to Yaffe’s interpretation, LoLordo (2012: 53) argues that if God\\n', 'wanted our desires to accord with the good, there are “far more efficient ways to\\n', 'ensure this than by giving us the power to suspend and deliberate.” LoLordo (2012:\\n', '51–2) argues against Yaffe’s understanding of free agency as self-transcendence, for it\\n', 'puts too much emphasis on the pursuit of a transcendent good as opposed to our\\n', 'own self-interest. Locke is clear that what we seek is happiness, which is to be\\n', 'achieved by the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. Pleasures and pains\\n', 'are what motivate voluntary action. So suspension of desire is in the service of\\n', 'gaining more pleasure and less pain in the long run, which seems not to be so\\n', 'much self-transcendence as it is self-determination. LoLordo (2012: 53) concludes\\n', 'that the value of suspension and deliberation for Locke’s account of free agency is not\\n', 'that it culminates in choices tied to the good, but rather in that it allows us to\\n', 'determine ourselves: “suspension is valuable because of the way it helps us to modify\\n', 'our desires, not because the desires we end up with after suspending track the good.”\\n', 'As my arguments so far have and will continue to bear out, I suspect it is fairly obvious\\n', 'that I would agree that Locke’s account of moral agency in the second edition of the Essay\\n', 'is more about self-determination than it is about self-transcendence. Indeed, I argue that\\n', 'what is most important about self-determination in moral agency is that it is rational self-\\n', 'determination. But I am sympathetic to one very important aspect of Yaffe’s view. I also\\n', 'argue that there is a value of suspension for our perfection, but for me it is the perfection\\n', 'of our nature as intellectual (rational) beings “to desire, will, and act according to the last\\n', 'result of a fair Examination” (II.xxi.47). Achieving that perfection, however, is not tied to\\n', 'transcending my human nature, by having my choices tied to the good, but to the best\\n', 'expression of my nature as an intellectual being in attaining the most pleasure possible—\\n', 'true happiness in the longer term, including in an afterlife.\\n', '\\n', 'I think Locke’s account of liberty, therefore, can be seen as grounding an ethics of\\n', 'naturalism in two parts.14 First, insofar as we are thinking intelligent beings, namely rational\\n', 'beings, it is a perfection of our nature that reason plays a significant role in determining\\n', '14 By “ethics of naturalism” I do not mean the contemporary view that nothing exists that is not natural, nor am I trying to equate what I see in Locke with any particular contemporary ethical theory. Rather, I simply mean that, for Locke, there is a correlation between how we are naturally, the kind of beings we are, and what we ought to do, such that the best expression of the former results in moral action, that is, actions commensurate with laws, which lead to greater happiness in the long term (to the avoidance of civil and divine punishment). See Darwall (1995) and Flage (2000) for other similar attributions.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'our actions. Reason not only tells us the best way to achieve happiness, but can also raise a\\n', 'desire to will an action proportionate to the assessment of what brings happiness. Locke\\n', 'says, “And therefore every Man is put under a necessity by his constitution, as an intelligent\\n', 'Being, to be determined in willing by his own Thought and Judgment, what is best for him to\\n', 'do” (II.xxi.48).15 But even though a judgment can raise a desire, unless desire is suspended\\n', 'already, we are too taken up with meeting our desires for a second-order judgment about\\n', 'our desires to intervene. That just is why Locke must include the suspension of desire in his\\n', 'account of moral agency—to make enough room for reason to have a role to play.16\\n', 'Second, although reason can trigger desire, it does not of itself determine the will.\\n', '\\n', 'Only desire motivates. Therefore, for Locke’s twofold account of our duty as intel-\\n', 'ligent agents (the suspension of desire and rational deliberation) to succeed,17 there\\n', 'must be another mechanism by which the will is determined to suspend desire. Our\\n', 'natural innate drive toward happiness (the innate practical principle) is insufficient\\n', 'to motivate the suspension of desire, for, as Locke says, it operates “constantly . . . and\\n', 'influences all our Actions without ceasing” (I.iii.3). Yet clearly we do not always\\n', 'suspend desire in order to deliberate about our actions; we do not always succeed in\\n', 'doing our duty. Suspension of desire, therefore, requires something more.\\n', '\\n', 'Interpreting Locke’s account of the motivation necessary for suspension requires\\n', 'that we make explicit what Locke, in this next passage, leaves relatively implicit:\\n', 'As therefore the highest perfection of intellectual nature, lies in a careful and constant pursuit\\n', 'of true and solid happiness; so the care of our selves, that we mistake not imaginary for real\\n', 'happiness, is the necessary foundation of our liberty. The stronger ties, we have, to an\\n', 'unalterable pursuit of happiness in general, which is our greatest good, and which as such\\n', 'our desires always follow, the more we are free from any necessary determination of our will to\\n', 'any particular action, and from a necessary compliance with our desire, set upon any\\n', 'particular, and then appearing any preferable good, till we have duly examin’d, whether it\\n', 'has a tendency to, or be inconsistent with our real happiness; and therefore till we are as much\\n', 'inform’d upon this enquiry, as the weight of the matter, and the nature of the case demands, we\\n', 'are by the necessity of preferring and pursuing true happiness as our greatest good, obliged to\\n', 'suspend the satisfaction of our desire in particular cases.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.51)\\n', '15 Following Chappell (2000: 247), I read Locke as meaning that this “Thought and Judgment” comes\\n', 'after a rational examination.\\n', '\\n', '16 It is uncontroversial, I think, that Locke sees the suspension of desire and deliberation as necessary to discharging our moral duty and so assuming moral responsibility: “And here we may see how it comes to pass, that a Man may justly incur punishment. . . . If neglect or abuse of the Liberty he had, to examine what would really and truly make for his Happiness, misleads him, the miscarriages that follow upon it, must be imputed to his own election. He had a Power to suspend his determination: It was given him, that he might examine, and take care of his own Happiness, and look that he were not deceived. And he could never judge, that it was better to be deceived, than not, in a matter of so great and near concernment” (II.xxi.56).\\n', '\\n', 'Locke’s use of “concernment” in this last sentence, of course, refers to the concern we have for our own true happiness.\\n', '\\n', '17 Bolton (2008: 264, n 31) argues that the duty of rational inquiry is a cognitive duty that “has a nonmoral ground.” Although she does not see it this way, she admits that it “is not inconsistent with the view that it is also a moral duty.”\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'The difficulty and importance of this passage warrant a careful look. Locke tells us\\n', 'that the highest perfection of our intellectual nature “lies in a careful and constant\\n', 'pursuit of true happiness.” From previous passages, we know that pursuit of “real” or\\n', '“true” happiness is the pursuit of long-term happiness ending ultimately in eternal\\n', 'happiness in an afterlife. In the consideration of any particular good we can make\\n', 'sure that that good is consistent with gaining true happiness.18 Moreover, Locke says\\n', 'that part of our natural pursuit of true happiness is the “care of ourselves” that we\\n', 'mistake not imaginary for real happiness, and this is the “necessary foundation of our\\n', 'liberty.” I take Locke to mean that we have a natural concern for ourselves that we\\n', 'attain true happiness.19 Not to mistake apparent for true happiness is to avoid a\\n', 'determination of the will to an action that we have not yet assessed insofar as it\\n', 'actually does bring true happiness. Therefore, the natural concern for our own true\\n', 'happiness is essential to the suspension of desire. Furthermore, in glossing the “care of\\n', 'our selves” that we pursue true happiness, Locke explains that the “stronger our ties”\\n', 'to the pursuit of “happiness in general, which is our greatest good . . . the more we are\\n', 'free from any necessary determination of our will to any particular action.” Here,\\n', 'Locke explains that the greater our concern for our happiness generally, the greater\\n', 'the impulse toward rational deliberation, and so the freer we are from necessary\\n', 'determination by any particular desire. Constitutive of the highest perfection of an\\n', 'intellectual nature, therefore, is a natural concern for ourselves that the happiness to\\n', 'which we are innately driven is true as opposed to merely apparent happiness. That\\n', 'Locke sees the innate practical principle (the desire for happiness generally) as\\n', 'insufficient on its own for suspension is further confirmed in this passage:\\n', 'But though this general Desire of Happiness operates constantly and invariably, yet the satisfac-\\n', 'tion of any particular desire can be suspended from determining the will to any subservient action, till we have maturely examin’d, whether the particular apparent good, which we then desire,\\n', 'makes a part of our real Happiness, or be consistent or inconsistent with it.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.71)\\n', 'If the general desire for happiness operates constantly, and yet any particular desire\\n', 'can be suspended, then clearly Locke must think that something more than the\\n', '18 If we have paid attention to religious education, understood and accepted its principles, Locke thinks we will choose eternal happiness over the pleasure promised by any other perceived good: “Change but a Man’s view of these things; let him see, that Virtue and Religion are necessary to his Happiness; let him look into the future State of Bliss or Misery, and see there God the righteous Judge, ready to render to every man according to his Deeds; . . . To him, I say, who hath a prospect of the different State of perfect Happiness or Misery, that attends all Men after this Life, depending on their behaviour here, the measures of Good and Evil, that govern his choice are mightily changed. For since nothing of pleasure and pain in this Life, can bear any proportion to endless Happiness, or exquisite Misery of an immortal Soul hereafter, Actions in his Power will have their preference, not according to the transient Pleasure, or Pain that accompanies, or follows them here; but as they serve to secure that perfect durable Happiness hereafter”\\n', '(II.xxi.60).\\n', '\\n', '19 In the Conduct of the Understanding, Locke (1996/1706: 182) says, “Besides his particular calling for the support of this life, everyone has a concern in a future life, which he is bound to look after. This engages his thoughts in religion; and here it mightily lies upon him to understand and reason right.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'general desire for happiness is required to resist the force of a particular desire. For\\n', 'surely Locke realizes that he cannot have it both ways. That something more, constitutive\\n', 'of the highest perfection of an intellectual nature, is the concern for ourselves that we\\n', 'attain true happiness.20\\n', 'Then, in this next passage, Locke ties our concern for true happiness to our ability\\n', 'to suspend desire. Indeed, our concern that we attain true happiness leads to the\\n', 'suspension of desire and rational deliberation:\\n', 'This is the hinge on which turns the liberty of intellectual beings in their constant endeavours\\n', 'after, and a steady prosecution of true felicity, that they can suspend this prosecution in\\n', 'particular cases, till they have looked before them, and informed themselves, whether that\\n', 'particular thing, which is then proposed, or desired, lie in the way to their main end, and make\\n', 'a real part of that which is their greatest good.

Whatever necessity determines to the pursuit of real Bliss, the\\n', 'same necessity, with the same force establishes suspence, deliberation, and scrutiny of each\\n', 'successive desire, whether the satisfaction of it, does not interfere with our true happiness, and\\n', 'mislead us from it.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.52)\\n', 'True felicity is a life with no uneasiness; it is our greatest good. It can be no other than\\n', 'eternal bliss, the eternal happiness of an afterlife.21 And even though we have a natural\\n', 'inclination to our own happiness generally, which gives us an “obligation” and a\\n', '“motive” to attain happiness by the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain, still\\n', 'we have to “take care” that we do not miss an opportunity for true happiness.22 I read\\n', 'Locke’s use of “to take care” in making sure that whatever pleasure we are driven\\n', 'toward makes a part of our “real” happiness as equivalent to having a “concern for true\\n', 'happiness.” That is, if I am taking care not to miss an opportunity for true happiness\\n', 'when I am confronted with a particular desire, then I must be concerned that whatever\\n', 'appears as bringing happiness really and truly does bring happiness—in the longer\\n', 'term. Locke then adds, “Whatever necessity determines to the pursuit of real Bliss, the\\n', 'same necessity, with the same force establishes suspence, deliberation, and scrutiny\\n', 'of each successive desire” (II.xxi.52). Locke says much the same thing in II.xxi.51: “we\\n', '20 To my knowledge, no one writing about this issue in Locke has recognized that something beyond the general desire for happiness is needed to motivate suspension. Bolton (2008), although not specifically addressing this issue, might be an exception. Walsh (2014) would be an outlier in that her account of suspension does not mention, at least explicitly, the general desire for happiness at all.\\n', '\\n', '21 Locke must be equating eternal happiness with true felicity, since the utmost happiness just is a life in which we have no uneasiness, a life in which we have no desire, since all the goods/pleasures we can imagine are already attained. It seems impossible that we, as bodily beings, can have a natural life without uneasiness. We will necessarily feels the pangs of hunger or other bodily discomforts.\\n', '\\n', '22 Interestingly, Hobbes (1994: xi.1, 57) defines felicity as “a continual progress of the desire, from one object to another, the attaining of the former being still but the way to the latter. The cause whereof is that the object of man’s desire is not to enjoy once only, and for one instant of time, but to assure forever the way of his future desire.”\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'are by the necessity of preferring and pursuing true happiness as our greatest good,\\n', 'obliged to suspend the satisfaction of our desire in particular cases.” Locke seems to be\\n', 'distinguishing true happiness from happiness generally. And whatever drives us to\\n', 'true as opposed to happiness generally is what also drives us to suspend desire.\\n', '\\n', 'So even though we are always driven toward our happiness generally—toward\\n', 'pleasure and away from pain—it is something more, an additional concern, or motiv-\\n', 'ation, that puts us in the direction of true happiness. Since it is the same force that moves\\n', 'us to true happiness (real Bliss) as moves us to suspend desire and deliberate about our\\n', 'actions, Locke must mean that the concern we have that the happiness we achieve is true\\n', 'happiness, or true felicity, is necessary to the suspension of desire. And the greater our\\n', 'concern for true happiness, that is, the greater our concern that whatever we are\\n', 'naturally driven toward leads to true happiness, the more we succeed in suspending a\\n', 'particular desire to assess its potential for true happiness.\\n', '\\n', 'What is more, because the alleviation of any pain results in pleasure, the concern\\n', 'to attain the most pleasure possible (true happiness) leads to the possibility of\\n', 'pursuing something that brings more pleasure, namely to the suspension of desire,\\n', 'regardless of whether after we have suspended desire we end up choosing what in fact\\n', 'promises the most pleasure. To sum up, insofar as we are beings with an intellectual\\n', 'nature, there is a natural concern for ourselves that reason is given its proper role to\\n', 'play in determining action even if the results of a rational deliberation are not\\n', 'without error. Suspension of desire creates the space for rational deliberation to\\n', 'occur. Working in tandem with our natural drive to happiness generally (the innate\\n', 'natural tendency to pleasure and away from pain imprinted in us from birth (I.iii.3)),\\n', 'is the additional concern for ourselves that we attain the kind (and degree) of\\n', 'happiness suitable to an intellectual nature—true happiness. Only when this add-\\n', 'itional concern for ourselves triggers the will to suspend desire are we in the right\\n', 'position to achieve our natural perfection.\\n', '\\n', 'Note that I am interpreting Locke’s use of “concern” here in a somewhat technical\\n', 'sense. When it is found in conjunction with happiness, Locke sometimes seems to\\n', 'have given it a more precise meaning: “concern” denotes a natural motivation toward\\n', 'true happiness, namely the uneasiness or pain of its absence. Let me draw attention to\\n', 'one passage where Locke seems explicitly to understand “concern” as equivalent to\\n', 'motivation. In II.xxi.43, when explaining that we can acknowledge a good without\\n', 'having a desire to pursue it, he says the following:\\n', 'Thus, how much soever Men are in earnest, and constant in pursuit of happiness; yet they may\\n', 'have a clear view of good, great and confessed good, without being concern’d for it, or moved\\n', 'by it, if they think they can make up their happiness without it. Though, as to pain, that they\\n', 'are always concern’d for; they can feel no uneasiness without being moved. (II.xxi.43)\\n', 'Here, Locke uses an appositive “or” to express that being “concern’d for” a good is the\\n', 'same as being “moved by it.” I take Locke to mean that I am concerned for, or moved\\n', 'by the pain or uneasiness of something’s absence. Moreover, we can fail to be\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'concerned to pursue something that is not perceived as contributing to our happi-\\n', 'ness, but we cannot fail to be concerned for (or moved by) something that causes\\n', 'pain. Any pain (or uneasiness) automatically, as the result of the way we are naturally\\n', 'constructed, generates a desire; we are moved to alleviate it. Given all the previous\\n', 'arguments in addition to this passage, there is good justification for concluding that\\n', 'Locke sees concern for ourselves that we attain true happiness (the pain of not having\\n', 'it) as having motivational force.23\\n', 'It is, of course, true that when Locke uses the term “concern” or “concernment” in the\\n', 'Essay it does not always carry this more technical meaning, and in these cases it is not\\n', 'meant to designate a motivation to suspend desire. This might be a good reason why\\n', 'Strawson (2011) interprets Locke’s use of concern in every case as merely having\\n', 'interests.24 One distinction I think we can make, though, is between interests for\\n', 'which it makes sense to be concerned about the true as opposed to the apparent\\n', 'happiness to be gained. For example, we find Locke using “concern” and “concernment”\\n', 'quite a lot in his II.xxvii chapter on personal identity. In II.xxvii.25, he tells us that “every\\n', 'intelligent being, sensible of Happiness and Misery, must grant, that there is something\\n', 'that is himself, that he is concerned for, and would have happy.” In II.xxvii.16, he says, “I\\n', 'being as much concern’d and as justly accountable for any Action was done a thousand\\n', 'Years since, appropriated to me now by this self-consciousness, as I am, for what I did in\\n', 'the last moment.”25 In the first passage, I am concerned for myself merely insofar as\\n', 'I suffer pleasures and pains; in the second, I am concerned for myself insofar as I am\\n', 'accountable for past actions. We see the same thing in Locke’s use of “concern” in his\\n', 'remarks about the certainty of sensitive knowledge (IV.ii.14, IV.xi.8). There he assures\\n', 'us that our degree of certainty is sufficient for our concerns, for our practical needs.\\n', '\\n', 'In each of the above cases, my happiness does not at all depend on drawing a\\n', 'distinction between true and apparent happiness. For example, I need not be worried\\n', 'that I cannot know whether a global skeptical scenario obtains, for as I have argued,\\n', 'I will feel the same pains or pleasures as the result of my sensory experiences\\n', 'regardless of whether or not they are actually produced by really existing external\\n', 'objects. In the II.xxvii.16 example from the chapter on personal identity, my concern\\n', 'is for myself insofar as I must suffer the consequences of an action I have already\\n', 'committed and so a rational assessment of its true value is pointless. I will suffer\\n', 'whatever happiness or misery comes with having done the action.26 But when I have\\n', '23 See also II.xxi.39, “I am sure, where-ever there is uneasiness there is desire: For we constantly desire happiness, and whatever we feel of uneasiness, so much, ’tis certain, we want of happiness.”\\n', '24 Strawson (2011: 25–6) sees concern, generally, in its reference to pleasure and pain as merely a\\n', '“matter of having interests.” But “Concern” and “Concernment” have “a psychological application, in which they mean a certain sort of feeling or attitude; so too, no less importantly, they both have a non-psychological or ‘objective’ application.” For example, one can have “business concerns” (2011: 28).\\n', '\\n', '25 Other examples are found in II.xxvii.17 and II.xxvii.14.\\n', '\\n', '26 This is not to say that as a result of realizing the misery coming to me as the result of my actions, I may not plead for forgiveness or change my ways. But this would be a future-regarding consideration about how to ensure true as opposed to apparent (or long- over short-term) happiness.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'a present desire driving a future action, my happiness is dependent on drawing that\\n', 'distinction. The difference here is that reason can play a role in whether or not\\n', 'I attain true happiness. But for reason to be effective, we must be able to suspend\\n', 'desire. So it makes sense that Locke’s use of “concern” for true happiness with respect\\n', 'to motivating suspension is different from his use of it in other places. Locke sees\\n', 'concern for ourselves that we attain true happiness as responsible for moving the will\\n', 'to suspend desire so that reason plays its proper role in determining our actions.27\\n', 'We now have very good reasons to draw the following two conclusions. First,\\n', 'when it comes to the true happiness to be gained from future actions, Locke seems to\\n', 'be using “concern” more technically to refer to a natural motivation resulting in the\\n', 'suspension of desire. That concern for true happiness plays this role in Locke’s\\n', 'account of moral motivation answers an important question. If the natural inclin-\\n', 'ation to happiness is constantly operative, then why do we sometimes fail to suspend\\n', 'our desires? Although the innate inclination to happiness may give us a reason and a\\n', 'motive to suspend, there is more to the motivational story for beings capable of\\n', 'rational, and, so also, moral agency. The concern for our own true happiness—a\\n', 'natural motivation toward the perfection of our nature as intellectual beings—is also\\n', 'operative. It provides the additional motivation making sure that reason plays the\\n', 'role it is supposed to play in our natural pursuit of happiness. One can, of course, still\\n', 'ask why we do not suspend all of the time, namely why we fail to suspend desire and\\n', 'why some people succeed in suspending more often than others? I will address these\\n', 'questions in the next section.\\n', '\\n', 'Second, just as we are naturally interrupted by the pain of not having what we need\\n', '(food and water) to ensure our physical preservation here and now, we are naturally\\n', 'interrupted by the pain of not having what we need (suspension of desire and\\n', 'rationally informed choices) to ensure our long-term preservation in this life and,\\n', 'perhaps, even in an afterlife. Insofar as we are beings capable of pleasure and pain, we\\n', 'have a constant and abiding natural inclination toward pleasure and away from pain:\\n', 'We are moved toward our happiness generally. Insofar as we are beings capable of\\n', 'rational deliberation, we have an additional capacity—a natural concern to make sure\\n', 'that the pleasures and pains we pursue and avoid contribute to our true (long-term)\\n', 'happiness. The effect of this latter motivation is the ability to suspend desire so that\\n', 'the perfection of an intellectual nature—the rational consideration of an action\\n', 'insofar as it promises true happiness—is achieved. Having a natural concern for\\n', 'ourselves that our happiness is true happiness, therefore, underwrites Locke’s\\n', 'account of the liberty necessary for moral agency.\\n', '\\n', '27 Bolton (2008: 262) puts it this way: “One is constantly moved by attractions and aversions of the moment, but Locke also supposes that such appetites co-exist with desires for future happiness and\\n', 'aversion to future misery. Such future-regarding desires give humans a natural motive to deploy reasoning in the pursuit of pleasure.” In addition to the arguments in her paper, I am grateful to Martha Bolton for her additional help in clarifying the role I see concern playing in Locke’s account.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'In the next section, we will see that the concern for ourselves that we attain true\\n', 'happiness, which grounds the liberty constitutive of moral agency, is linked to the\\n', 'fact that we are self-conscious beings.\\n', '\\n', '5.4 Consciousness and the Concern for Happiness\\n', 'Locke himself links consciousness to the concern we have for our own happiness in\\n', 'the II.xxvii chapter, On Identity and Diversity. On the nature of the self, he says:\\n', 'Self is that conscious thinking thing, (whatever Substance, made up of whether Spiritual, or\\n', 'Material, Simple, or Compounded it matters not) which is sensible of Pleasure and Pain,\\n', 'capable of Happiness or Misery, and so is concern’d for it self, as far as that consciousness\\n', 'extends.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxvii.17)28\\n', 'Selves, or persons, for Locke, are not only able to feel pleasure and pain, but also they\\n', 'are capable of happiness and misery. But to be concerned for myself insofar as I am\\n', 'apt to feel pleasure and pain and am capable of happiness and misery requires that\\n', 'I have consciousness. It is not enough that I am a creature that senses pleasure and\\n', 'pain; I must also be aware of my pleasure and pain. Pleasures, pains, happiness, and\\n', 'misery would be nothing to me, were I not conscious of it. Locke confirms as much\\n', 'when he says, “For to be happy or miserable without being conscious of it, seems to\\n', 'me utterly inconsistent and impossible” (II.i.11). Saying that I am happy or miserable\\n', 'if I am unable to experience happiness or misery is nonsensical.\\n', '\\n', 'Moreover, concern for happiness is not just due to the awareness of pleasure and\\n', 'pain—the capacity actually to feel pleasure and pain—but also that the pleasure and\\n', 'pain is experienced by me. Locke says:\\n', 'For as to this point of being the same self, it matters not whether this present self be made up of the same or other Substances, I being as much concern’d, . . . for any Action that was done a\\n', 'thousand years since, appropriated to me now by this self-consciousness, as I am, for what I did\\n', 'the last moment.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxvii.16)\\n', 'Regardless of whether the pleasure is in the distant past or occurred in the previous\\n', 'moment, I am concerned about it only insofar as the consciousness of it is my\\n', 'consciousness: the action (and the pleasure or pain attached) is mine. I cannot feel\\n', 'another’s pain, so I am not concerned about another’s pain, at least not in the same\\n', 'way. Therefore, insofar as there is a natural connection between consciousness and\\n', 'the concern we have for any happiness, it must be a connection between self-\\n', 'consciousness and the concern for happiness. It is a concern for myself insofar as\\n', 'I am a being that experiences pleasure and pain.\\n', '\\n', '28 Note that Locke’s use of “concern” here can be with respect to either past or future-regarding actions.\\n', '\\n', 'As argued earlier, only in the latter sense could it take on the technical meaning.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'Perhaps the clearest connection Locke makes between consciousness and a con-\\n', 'cern for happiness is in his II.xxvii.26 definition of ‘person’:29\\n', 'It is a Forensick Term appropriating Actions and their Merit; and so belongs only to intelligent\\n', 'Agents capable of a Law, and Happiness and Misery. This personality extends it self beyond\\n', 'present Existence to what is past, only by consciousness, whereby it becomes concerned and\\n', 'accountable, owns and imputes to it self past Actions, just upon the same ground, and for the\\n', 'same reason, that it does the present.

Because\\n', 'we are rational (intellectual) beings who can look to the future,30 we can be naturally\\n', 'moved to suspend desire in order to allow reason its role in attaining our natural\\n', 'perfection. The link between consciousness and concern is a part of that perfection.\\n', '\\n', 'Moreover, that we are rational beings conscious of pleasure and pain and so\\n', 'concerned about our true happiness answers another important consideration in\\n', 'Locke’s account of moral agency. Given that, as I interpret him, Locke has a causal\\n', 'theory of agency, it is reasonable to ask why we should think there is any real agency\\n', 'at all. Yaffe (2000: 121–2) puts it this way:\\n', '[C]ausal theories of agency build doings out of happenings and causal relations. . . . The\\n', 'problem all causal theories face—or rather the obstacle they must overcome—might be called\\n', 'the Where’s the Agent Problem. . . . In general, no matter what the concept of agency we are\\n', 'trying to understand—whether it is action in general or intentional action, or autonomous\\n', 'action—if we analyze it as an event caused in some particular way by events and states of an\\n', '29 See Boeker (2014: 232–8) for a detailed and persuasive argument that Locke’s two definitions of\\n', '‘person’ in II.xxvii.9 and II.xxvii.26 are fully consistent.\\n', '\\n', '30 The next section contains a full discussion of how the unity of consciousness is achieved such that our concern for happiness is future-directed.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'agent, there is always room to ask for a justification for equating those particular events or\\n', 'states with the agent herself.\\n', '\\n', 'Yaffe argues that suitable agency is found in Locke’s linking of consciousness to our\\n', 'choices (volitions or acts of the will). On Yaffe’s (2000: 120, 126) view, which includes\\n', 'features similar to an appropriation-like interpretation of personal identity in Locke,\\n', 'consciousness (or those thoughts and actions we are conscious of) sets the bound-\\n', 'aries of a particular person.31 Moreover, our choices are necessarily internal to us.\\n', '\\n', 'Choices are essentially internal to us as persons, because were we not conscious of\\n', 'them, they would not count as choices at all. So insofar as we are conscious of our\\n', 'choices, there is a connection between a feature of us as persons (consciousness) and\\n', 'something essentially internal to us leading to action (a choice, or volition).\\n', '\\n', 'Unfortunately, though, as Yaffe realizes and confronts, this link between us as\\n', 'persons and our choices is not enough, for it is merely correlation; consciousness\\n', 'does not play a role itself in the production of the action, and so is not enough to\\n', 'locate a source of agency. Rather, according to Yaffe (2000: 130), “we want our\\n', 'choices not merely to be essentially internal to ourselves; we also want the fact of their\\n', 'internality to account for their causal role.” We want the feature of us as persons to be\\n', 'linked to the cause of a particular choice, or volition—to what moves the will. That\\n', 'can be achieved, he argues, by focusing on the relation between consciousness and\\n', 'pleasure and pain. Yaffe turns to Locke’s II.i.11 claim, cited earlier, that it makes no\\n', 'sense that we can have pleasure and pain and not be conscious of it. But notice that\\n', 'he (2000: 133) emphasizes that Locke is making a conceptual point:\\n', '[T]he very idea of having a pain without feeling it is “impossible” and “inconsistent.” In this\\n', 'respect, pains and pleasure are for Locke like choices: a modification of an agent cannot\\n', 'possibly count as a pain or a pleasure unless the agent is “conscious” of it.\\n', '\\n', 'This allows Yaffe (2000: 133) to draw the following conclusion:\\n', 'As uneasinesses are pains, and pains always involve “consciousness,” and “consciousness” is\\n', 'constitutive of personal identity, to say that an agent’s volitions are caused by her uneasinesses\\n', 'is to say that they are caused by a state that is essentially internal to her qua person, for a state of an agent of which she is not “conscious” cannot possibly count as a pain.\\n', '\\n', 'Yaffe has established the link he sought between consciousness (the boundaries of\\n', 'personal identity) and the cause of an act of the will. Because consciousness is necessary\\n', 'for uneasiness to count as uneasiness and uneasiness causes volition, we can say that\\n', 'there is an internal state of a person qua person (consciousness of an uneasiness)\\n', 'causing the volition. Our choices can be said to come from us as persons.\\n', '\\n', '31 Yaffe (2007) abandons this interpretation of the boundaries of consciousness, and in fact argues against it. Since here I am interested only in the link between consciousness and choice (or between persons and their actions) in order to establish a more robust notion of agency, the status of an appropriation interpretation, or whether Yaffe abandoned it, matters not to my argument. In fact, in chapter four, I argued quite vociferously against it.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'I am sympathetic to much of Yaffe’s solution to the problem of establishing\\n', 'sufficient agency in Locke’s causal theory of action. I worry, though, that the agency\\n', 'found is insufficient for free and so moral agency. That is, to tie consciousness to\\n', 'uneasiness does not distinguish the kind of agency we would see in animals from\\n', 'what we would find in persons, for as we have seen, Locke is clearly committed to the\\n', 'view that animals (human and non-human) are conscious. Because all thinking is\\n', 'conscious, and, for Locke, animals think (have perception), animals are conscious.32\\n', 'But surely if we are to establish sufficient agency for persons, we want it to be moral\\n', 'agency—the kind of agency suitable to a “forensic” being.\\n', '\\n', 'Fortunately, my account provides exactly what we are looking for. The internal\\n', 'connection we are seeking between a being insofar as she is a person (or a state of a\\n', 'being qua person) and her choices is the concern for true happiness—that what we\\n', 'desire really does bring happiness as opposed to misery in the longer term. For ease,\\n', 'let me repeat Locke’s II.xxvii definition of a person:\\n', 'It is a Forensick Term appropriating Actions and their Merit; and so belongs only to intelligent\\n', 'Agents capable of a Law, and Happiness and Misery. This personality extends it self beyond\\n', 'present Existence to what is past, only by consciousness, whereby it becomes concerned and\\n', 'accountable, owns and imputes to it self past Actions, just upon the same ground, and for the\\n', 'same reason, that it does the present. All which is founded in a concern for Happiness the\\n', 'unavoidable concomitant of consciousness, that which is conscious of Pleasure and Pain,\\n', 'desiring, that that self, that is conscious, should be happy.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxvii.26)\\n', 'To be an “intelligent Agent capable of a Law” is to have reason and reflection. We\\n', 'must be able both to assess and to regulate our potential actions in terms of their\\n', 'permissibility according to laws—civil laws and laws of reputation, but most import-\\n', 'antly divine laws. But this just is to be a being with an intellectual nature, the “highest\\n', 'perfection” of which “lies in a careful and constant pursuit of true and solid\\n', 'happiness” (II.xxi.51). Moral agency, the agency suitable to a being with an intellec-\\n', 'tual nature, then, is grounded in the suspension of desire and the rational assessment\\n', 'of potential actions as they compare to laws and so promise either happiness or\\n', 'misery—long-term happiness or misery. I suggest that because we are beings with an\\n', 'intellectual nature conscious of pleasure and pain who are naturally concerned about\\n', 'their own true happiness, we are sufficiently connected to our choices/volitions to\\n', 'answer the “Where’s the agent problem.”\\n', 'The connection we are seeking, between a state internal to us insofar as we are\\n', 'persons and a choice that establishes moral agency, is not between consciousness and\\n', 'an act of the will, but between the concern we have for our own true happiness and an\\n', 'act of the will.

And it is the suspension of desire and rational deliberation that fulfills our\\n', 'moral duty, that is the expression of our moral agency. Insofar as we are beings with\\n', 'an intellectual nature, our concern for our own true happiness (an uneasiness)\\n', 'connects who we are as persons, as moral agents, namely beings able to suspend\\n', 'desire and deliberate about which actions are sanctioned by law, with a particular\\n', 'choice and so with a particular action. So, I (qua person, qua moral agent) am the\\n', 'cause of my choice to perform a particular action. There is a fact of my internality as a\\n', 'moral agent that plays a necessary causal role in my choices leading to actions with\\n', 'moral value.\\n', '\\n', 'I have shown that consciousness is linked to concern in that only (intellectual)\\n', 'beings conscious of pleasure and pain can be concerned about their own true\\n', 'happiness. I have also argued that concern for true happiness, as the motivation\\n', 'for suspension and deliberation, causally links an agent to her choices sufficiently to\\n', 'answer Yaffe’s “Where’s the agent problem.” A question might still be lingering: If we\\n', 'have a natural concern for true happiness similar to our natural drive toward\\n', 'pleasure and away from pain generally, then why do we not always suspend desire?\\n', '\\n', 'Why do we sometimes lack the requisite concern to suspend a desire, and why do\\n', 'some people suspend their desires more often than others? The answer lies in the role\\n', 'of education and habituation in developing a more rational nature. In Some Thoughts\\n', 'Concerning Education, after having provided advice about how best to care for the\\n', 'body, Locke moves to the care of the mind:\\n', 'Due care being had to keep the body in strength and vigor so that it may be able to obey and\\n', 'execute the orders of the mind, the next principle business is to set the mind right, that on all\\n', 'occasions it may be disposed to consent to nothing but what may be suitable to the dignity and\\n', 'excellency of a rational creature.\\n', '\\n', '(Locke 1996/1693: 25)\\n', 'Consenting only to that which reason recommends leads to the perfection, or what Locke\\n', 'calls the “excellency,” of an intellectual being, namely a creature capable of being guided\\n', 'by reason. Then Locke tells us what that excellence consists in and how to achieve it:\\n', 'It seems plain to me that the principle of all virtue and excellency lies in a power of denying\\n', 'ourselves the satisfaction of our own desires where reason does not authorize them. This power\\n', 'is to be got and improved by custom, made easy and familiar by an early practice.\\n', '\\n', '(Locke 1996/1693: 29)\\n', 'Now Locke does not use the terms “suspension” or the “the suspension of desire” in\\n', 'Some Thoughts Concerning Education, but it is clear that this is what he means.\\n', '\\n', 'Virtue and excellence in a rational nature consist in reason taking the lead in action;\\n', 'we are able to resist our desires in order that we can rationally assess what is best for\\n', 'us to do in order to achieve happiness.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'Moreover, the strength of this power to suspend desire comes with education and\\n', 'habituation:\\n', 'He that has not a mastery over his inclinations, he that knows not how to resist the importunity of present pleasure or pain for the sake of what reason tells him is fit to be done, wants the true principle of virtue and industry and is in danger never to be good for anything. This temper, therefore, so\\n', 'contrary to unguided nature, is to be got betimes; and this habit, as the true foundation of future ability and happiness, is to be wrought into the mind as early as may be.\\n', '\\n', '(Locke 1996/1693: 32)\\n', 'If what I said at the beginning of this discourse be true, as I do not doubt but it is, viz. that the difference to be found in the manners and abilities of men is owing more to their education than\\n', 'to anything else, we have reason to conclude that great care is to be had of the forming children’s minds and giving them that seasoning early that shall influence their lives always after. . . . As the strength of the body lies chiefly in being able to endure hardships, so also does that of the mind.\\n', '\\n', 'And the great principle and foundation of all virtue and worth is placed in this, that a man is able to deny himself his own desires, cross his own inclinations, and purely follow what reason directs\\n', 'as best though the appetite lean the other way.\\n', '\\n', '(Locke 1996/1693: 25)\\n', 'So, first, Locke confirms that we all have the capacity to resist a desire, but that whether\\n', 'or not, and how well, we are able to exercise that capacity, how strong is our ability to\\n', 'suspend desire, depends on whether or not we have been educated, or habituated, to\\n', 'do it. And just as the body must be cared for and strengthened in order to resist the\\n', 'physical difficulties we face, our minds must be strengthened in order to resist our\\n', 'own inclinations, so that reason is allowed its proper role in our lives.\\n', '\\n', 'Second, Locke tells us how the mind is strengthened so that we are able to resist our\\n', 'inclinations. Although we are all born with the capacity to use reason, we are not born\\n', 'fully rational and moral agents. Locke is clear that young children lack ideas of\\n', 'reflection (II.i.8), which suggests they also lack other complex abilities of the under-\\n', 'standing, say, the ability to make rational judgments about what conduces to long-\\n', 'term happiness. Locke says as much when he contrasts the difference in parenting a\\n', 'younger as opposed to a grown child: “For liberty and indulgence can do no good to\\n', 'children: their want of judgment makes them stand in need of restraint and discipline”\\n', '(Locke 1996/1693: 31). Because young children cannot make moral judgments, they\\n', 'must be constrained to act properly. Contrast this approach with his advice concern-\\n', 'ing a parent’s relation to a much older child. “We must look upon our children, when\\n', 'grown up, to be like ourselves: with the same passions, the same desires. We would be\\n', 'thought rational creatures, and have our freedom” (Locke 1996/1693: 31). Grown\\n', 'children no longer need to be constrained by means of parental discipline because like\\n', 'their parents they can rely on their own reason (and freedom to use it) to guide them.\\n', '\\n', 'Moreover, the mere passage of years and the subjection to disciplinary measures\\n', 'are not the most important causes of a more fully developed rational (and virtuous)\\n', 'nature. Most important is a substantive education:\\n', 'Indeed, fear of having a scanty portion if they displease you may make them [your children]\\n', 'slaves to your estate, but they will be never the less ill and wicked in private; and that restraint\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'will not last always. Every man must sometime or other be trusted to himself and his own\\n', 'conduct; and he that is good, a virtuous and able man must be made so within. And therefore\\n', 'what he is to receive from education, what is to sway and influence his life, must be something put into him betimes: habits woven into the very principles of his nature.\\n', '\\n', '(Locke 1996/1693: 31–2)\\n', 'A child receiving the right kind of education will develop “habits woven into the very\\n', 'principles of his nature.” Locke is clear that this sort of education does not consist in the\\n', 'rote learning of rules whether inculcated by discipline or by tutors, but rather in\\n', 'habituating virtue (good moral reasoning) as the result of practice and following the\\n', 'example of others. In Of the Conduct of the Understanding, Locke (1996/1706: 173)\\n', 'reiterates his view: “We are born with faculties and powers capable of almost anything,\\n', 'such at least as would carry us farther than can easily be imagined: but it is only the\\n', 'exercise of those powers which gives us ability and skill in anything, and leads us towards\\n', 'perfection,” and a little later he says, “the faculties of our souls are improved and made\\n', 'useful to us just after the same manner as our bodies are . . . ; we are born to be if we\\n', 'please, rational creatures, but it is use and exercise only that makes us so.” Through\\n', 'exercise and practice our capacity to suspend desire and engage in good reasoning (and\\n', 'so also virtuous conduct) is transformed into a natural skill.\\n', '\\n', 'Although Locke thinks the best education for a rational mind comes from the\\n', 'practice of mathematics, the lack of sufficient leisure does not lessen one’s obligation\\n', '“to think and reason right about what is their daily employment” (Locke 1996/1706:\\n', '182). Not to expect at least that of an adult rational being is tantamount to “leveling\\n', 'them with the brutes, and charging them with a stupidity below the rank of a rational\\n', 'creature” (Locke 1996/1706: 182). There is, however, one duty to education we all have:\\n', '“Besides his particular calling for the support of this life, everyone has a concern in a\\n', 'future life, which he is bound to look after. This engages his thoughts in religion; and\\n', 'here it mightily lies upon him to understand and reason right” (Locke 1996/1706: 182).\\n', '\\n', 'Locke continues that the best way to fit the mind to the kind of education offered by\\n', 'religion is to “fill it with moral and more abstract ideas” (Locke 1996/1706: 183). I take\\n', 'Locke’s point to be this. Because we have an innate drive to happiness and a capacity\\n', 'both to consider our future actions as ours and to care about what the future brings, we\\n', 'have an obligation as rational beings to do all that we must do to ensure that that future\\n', 'is a good one, namely one with true happiness. Thus, we should gain knowledge of\\n', 'religion, which tells us what kind of future awaits us and how best to achieve it, namely\\n', 'by making sure our actions are commensurate with divine law. Of course, this does not\\n', 'mean that only those steeped in religion can be concerned for and achieve longer-term\\n', 'happiness. For we should also gain knowledge of civil laws and laws of reputation so\\n', 'that our actions are commensurate with those and so avoid associated punishments.33\\n', '33 Though, in “Resurrectio et quae sequuntur,” Locke (2002: 224) does seem to reserve everlasting “life to the just, to beleivers [sic], to the obedient; & death to the wicked and unbeleivers [sic].” See, again, note 8.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'That is, we should gain more moral and abstract ideas so that we can make better\\n', 'moral judgments about how best to achieve true happiness.34\\n', 'What we find in Locke, I suggest, is a sort of natural feedback loop. Our natural\\n', 'constitution (the innate drive to pleasure and away from pain and consciousness of\\n', 'pleasure and pain) leads us to seek that which brings pleasure and avoids pain. But\\n', 'once we gain the ability to determine the difference between apparent and true\\n', 'happiness, which is then aided by experience and education, we come to be naturally\\n', 'moved to seek that which is more suitable to the beings we have become—beings who\\n', 'can exercise an intellectual nature. Now not only are we driven toward pleasure and\\n', 'away from pain, but also we are concerned that what we are driven toward is true as\\n', 'opposed to apparent happiness. Were we still unable to deliberate about our actions,\\n', 'the concern for true happiness would be pointless, and even frustrating. That is why\\n', 'young children not yet able to distinguish apparent from true happiness—or short-\\n', 'from long-term happiness—have no concern for the latter over the former. But once\\n', 'we gain the ability to distinguish immediate from longer-term pleasures and to use\\n', 'our reason to attain the latter instead of the former, we trigger in ourselves a natural\\n', 'concern that we achieve all we can, insofar as we are the kind of beings we are. This,\\n', 'of course, leads us to seek education, to learn what brings the most pleasure and\\n', 'avoids the most pain. In turn, greater education results in even more concern to\\n', 'attain the long-term happiness we have learned is open to us and so naturally moves\\n', 'the will more regularly to suspend desire so that we are successful. The more we\\n', 'understand our possibilities for the future and the way to attain them, the greater is\\n', 'our concern for that future (true) happiness, and thus the greater and more regular is\\n', 'the force exerted on the will to suspend a particular desire in order rationally to assess\\n', 'its promise of true happiness.\\n', '\\n', 'Therefore, and at the threat of repetition, insofar as we are beings capable of\\n', 'pleasure and pain, we have a natural drive to pleasure and away from pain.

In this way, we become better\\n', 'and better at suspending desire in order to deliberate about what we want to do.\\n', '\\n', 'Through this process we develop good rational habits of volition, judgment, and\\n', 'action suitable to the perfection of an intellectual nature.\\n', '\\n', 'Again, this does not preclude those who lack formal education in either the law or\\n', 'religion from attaining longer-term happiness.

This is also evident in the way that God has designed us to feel pleasure and pain to make us industrious and ultimately to lead us to seek ultimate happiness in God.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'suspend desire and think about the consequences of our choices in order to avoid,\\n', 'even unknowingly, acting immorally. So although religious education will inform us\\n', 'about what true happiness ultimately consists in, and formal education will inform us\\n', 'of the laws we should abide, coming to understand and employ our own rational\\n', 'capacities in the service of pleasure is all that is needed to trigger a natural concern\\n', 'that we think about what we do in order to ensure more happiness in the longer term.\\n', '\\n', 'And in so doing we achieve the kind, and are on our way to achieving the degree, of\\n', 'happiness meant for us. I suppose it is also possible that one is born finding pleasure\\n', 'only in what is also commensurate with law, so that neither suspension nor deliber-\\n', 'ation is necessary to attaining true happiness. But given that pleasure is often tied to\\n', 'self-interest, for Locke, as well as his great concern with how to educate children to be\\n', 'more rational (and virtuous), it is doubtful that he would think there are such\\n', 'persons. Indeed, Locke thinks that it is the “superior Beings above us . . . that . . . are\\n', 'more steadily determined in their choice of Good than we” (II.xxi.49).\\n', '\\n', 'Similarly, against the objection that it is not a very robust sense of liberty to be\\n', 'naturally moved to choose whatever action results from a deliberation about what is\\n', 'best for one to do, Locke argues that it would be evidence of madness to want it any\\n', 'other way:\\n', 'If to break loose from the conduct of Reason, and to want that restraint of Examination and\\n', 'Judgment, which keeps us from chusing or doing the worse, be Liberty, true Liberty, mad Men\\n', 'and Fools are the only Freemen: But yet, I think, no Body would chuse to be mad for the sake of\\n', 'such Liberty, but he that is mad already.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.50)\\n', 'One would be mad, or at a least a fool, not to want one’s actions to be guided by\\n', 'reason.

He considers whether “any one\\n', 'be a Changeling, because he is less determined, by wise Considerations, than a wise\\n', 'Man” (II.xxi.50). The point, I take it, is that it is a perfection of an intellectual nature\\n', 'to be guided by reason, and that were one not so vulnerable to the result of a rational\\n', 'deliberation, one might not have an intellectual nature at all. Therefore, insofar as we\\n', 'are intellectual beings, we have a power to suspend a particular desire in order to let\\n', 'reason play its natural role in our pursuit of happiness. And once we are able to\\n', 'employ our reason to figure out what we most want, we gain a natural concern for\\n', 'our own true happiness, which, if strong enough, activates that power of suspension.\\n', '\\n', 'Differences in the ability to suspend desire, therefore, are linked to differences in\\n', 'the degree of concern for one’s own true happiness, which is linked to one’s degree of\\n', 'intellectual perfection, at any particular time. More and better religious and moral\\n', '(and legal) education will lead to greater concern, more regular suspension, and more\\n', 'room for reason to play a role in the conduct of our lives.

I then concen-\\n', 'trated primarily on establishing (2), that Locke’s theory of personal identity includes a\\n', 'metaphysical fact of an ongoing self, a continuing consciousness. But also important\\n', 'to Locke’s “forensic” account of persons (that persons are “intelligent Agents capable\\n', 'of a Law, and Happiness and Misery” (II.xxvii.26)) is that we are able to experience\\n', 'ourselves as ongoing—as temporal beings. That is, the metaphysical fact of a con-\\n', 'tinuing consciousness is revealed to us as a phenomenological fact of ourselves as\\n', 'extending into the past and into the future. Locke’s account of moral agency can be\\n', 'seen to rely on this phenomenological fact in that we must be able to experience a past\\n', 'self to take responsibility for what we did, and we must be able to experience a future\\n', 'self in order to be concerned for the true happiness and misery that may come our\\n', 'way. In this section, we will see how pre-reflective consciousness constituent in every\\n', 'mental act provides such an experience necessary for moral motivation.\\n', '\\n', 'Locke’s account of moral agency includes that we experience ourselves as temporal\\n', 'beings. As we saw in his version of the cogito argument, Locke is clear that we are\\n', 'conscious of our own synchronic existence whenever we perceive an idea: “In every\\n', 'Act of Sensation, Reasoning, and Thinking, we are conscious to our selves of our own\\n', 'Being; and, in this Matter, come not short of the highest degree of Certainty”\\n', '(IV.ix.3). But also, as we know from his account of personal identity in II.xxvii.,\\n', 'being a person requires that we also have a diachronic experience of ourselves:\\n', 'This being premised to find wherein personal identity consists, we must consider what Person\\n', 'stands for; which, I think, is a thinking intelligent Being, that has reason and reflection, and\\n', 'can consider it self as it self, that same thinking thing in different times and places; which it\\n', 'does only by that consciousness, which is inseparable from thinking, and it seems to me\\n', 'essential to it.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxvii.9)\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Consciousness allows for an experience of our own diachronic unity, because we are\\n', 'conscious of ourselves as the same self in different perceptions of ideas. In chapter\\n', 'four, I gave a promissory note to explain how we achieve unity of consciousness. It is\\n', 'time now to cash it in. As we saw only briefly in chapter four, Locke argues that\\n', 'consciousness provides for the experience of ourselves as extending into the past.\\n', '\\n', 'Consciousness, Locke says, “joins” thoughts and actions to a single self:\\n', 'That with which the consciousness of this present thinking thing can join it self, makes the same\\n', 'Person, and is one self with it, and with nothing else; and so attributes to it self, and owns all the Actions of that thing, as its own, as far as that consciousness reaches, and no farther; as\\n', 'everyone who reflects will perceive. (II.xxvii.17)35\\n', 'That we experience the same self in different thoughts (and actions) allows for the\\n', '“joining,” or unifying, of conscious states. In other words, the consciousness of each\\n', 'mental state provides an experience of the self, and the consciousness of successive\\n', 'mental states provides an experience of a unified self.36 Consider these two passages:\\n', '[Y]et ’tis plain consciousness, as far as ever it can be extended, should it be to Ages past, unites Existences, and Actions, very remote in time, into the same Person, as well as it does the\\n', 'Existence and Actions of the immediately preceding moment.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxvii.16)\\n', 'For as to this point of being the same self, it matters not whether this present self be made up of the same or other Substances, I being as much concern’d, and as justly accountable for any\\n', 'Action was done a thousand Years since, appropriated to me now by this self-consciousness, as\\n', 'I am, for what I did the last moment.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxvii.16)\\n', 'In both passages, we see that not only specifically remembered episodes, but each and\\n', 'every successive momentary thought, is experienced as united by the same con-\\n', 'sciousness or self.37 Just as there is an experience of unity of consciousness, namely\\n', 'I perceive myself as the same self when I look to “Ages past,” perhaps when I think\\n', 'back on my twenty-first birthday, there is an experience of the unity of consciousness\\n', 'when I conjure up the middle term of an argument that allows me to deduce the\\n', 'proper conclusion. In both cases, I experience myself as the same self in a continuous\\n', 'stream of thinking—as temporally extended.38\\n', 'Interpreting consciousness as a self-referential constituent of any mental act allows\\n', 'for these different temporal experiences of ourselves. In addition to the many passages\\n', '35 A temptation, which should be resisted on pain of circularity, is to read this passage as saying that the continuing consciousness is constructed from successive conscious states. A more sympathetic reading sees the passage as suggesting that we have an experience of continuity in successive states of consciousness: We experience our conscious states of ourselves as linked in a continuing stream of consciousness.\\n', '\\n', '36 Our experience of the unity of consciousness is largely consistent with Yaffe (2011). I find some of Yaffe’s discussion similar to what we find in C. D. Broad (1923: 54–62).\\n', '\\n', '37 As mentioned in chapter four, Locke was not as careful as he ought to have been about distinguishing episodic from what is often called “semantic” or factual memory. I take it, though, that his claims in these passages refer to both.\\n', '\\n', '38 I will provide a more expansive explanation of these examples shortly.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'already cited, we see this intimate relation between consciousness and thinking or\\n', 'willing also in the following:\\n', 'And therefore how far the consciousness of past Actions is annexed to any individual Agent,\\n', 'so that another cannot possibly have it, will be hard for us to determine, till we know what\\n', 'kind of Action it is, that cannot be done without a reflex Act of Perception accompanying it.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxvii.13)\\n', 'Reflexively, consciousness provides for the awareness of the thought or action as\\n', 'specifically belonging to me—the “I” thinking—such that it does not belong to\\n', 'another. The “reflex Act of Perception” (consciousness)39 accompanying a thought\\n', 'or action provides it with a unique first-personal character—a character of mine-ness\\n', 'or for-me-ness. Thus, Locke claims that I cannot know whether anyone else can have\\n', 'my experience of myself as thinking until I know whether what makes the thinking\\n', 'particularly mine—its first-personal character—can be separated from the thinking\\n', 'itself.40 Once we see that the first-personal character of consciousness is essential to\\n', 'experiencing any single perception as mine, it is easier to see how consecutive\\n', 'perceptions of ideas, whether temporally contiguous or not, can be experienced as\\n', 'temporally unified. That is, Locke clearly thinks we experience ourselves as diachron-\\n', 'ically unified and that the first-personal character of consciousness constituent in\\n', 'every mental act provides that experience.\\n', '\\n', 'How should we see our experience of ourselves as unified in consciousness? As we\\n', 'already know, Locke maintains that we have ideas in the mind simultaneously. The\\n', 'composition of complex ideas of substances requires that we have several simple ideas in\\n', 'the mind at the same time, as does reflecting on the perception of an idea and perceiving\\n', 'a relation between ideas.41 If ideas are perceived in the mind simultaneously, then we are\\n', 'also conscious of ourselves as perceiving those ideas. Consider, first, an example in\\n', 'which we have knowledge in virtue of perceiving an agreement involving simultaneous\\n', 'ideas. “Thus the Mind,” Locke says, “perceives that White is not Black, that a Circle is not\\n', 'a Triangle, That Three are more than Two, and equal to One and Two. Such kind of\\n', 'truths the Mind perceives at the first sight of the Ideas together” (IV.ii.1). To take just\\n', 'one of these examples, I am conscious I am perceiving an idea of the number three and\\n', 'I am conscious I am perceiving an idea of the number two. But my experience in being\\n', 'conscious that I am perceiving an agreement of ideas seems to be that I am conscious of\\n', 'the same self as perceiving both ideas. Because both perceptions have the same first-\\n', 'personal character, I experience the two perceptions of ideas as held together by one\\n', 'consciousness. Resulting is a complex conscious state of myself as knowing intuitively\\n', 'that three is more than two. The experience of the unity of consciousness is such that\\n', '39 Thiel (2011: 123, n 5) also reads the “reflex Act” in this passage as referring to consciousness.\\n', '\\n', '40 This passage is from Locke’s famous case of consciousness transference in II.xxvii.13, which received a good bit of discussion in chapter four.\\n', '\\n', '41 See, again, those passages (II.xi.6, II.i.4, and II.xxv.1) from the introduction to chapter three.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'there can be one and the same consciousness linking two perceptions of ideas in a\\n', 'proposition known to be true.42\\n', 'That we experience the unity of consciousness is also evident in cases where we\\n', 'engage in demonstrative reasoning. But here we have an experience of unity of\\n', 'consciousness in successive contiguous perceptions of ideas. For example, first\\n', 'there is a perception of the idea ‘P!Q’ followed by the perception of the idea ‘P.’\\n', 'It seems that in order to intuit ‘Q’ the perception of the idea ‘P’ must be brought into\\n', 'contemporaneity with the perception of the idea ‘P!Q.’ Perceptions of ideas would,\\n', 'in a sense, overlap one another in my consciousness in something more like an\\n', 'extended present.43 This can be achieved if thinking is temporally extended in the\\n', 'sense that one idea can remain in the mind while another idea is perceived. In this\\n', 'kind of case, perceptions of ideas are united or gathered together in consciousness,\\n', 'perhaps we should say “joined,” such that I am conscious of myself as temporally\\n', 'extended through these successive perceptions of ideas. Locke does not specifically\\n', 'describe the perception of a demonstrative agreement as the result of reasoning as\\n', 'temporally extended. But he does suggest something like it in his description of how\\n', 'we employ intervening ideas in a demonstration:\\n', 'The Reason why the Mind cannot always perceive presently the Agreement or Disagreement of\\n', 'two Ideas is, because those Ideas, concerning whose Agreement or Disagreement the Enquiry is\\n', 'made, cannot by the Mind be so put together, as to shew it. In this Case then, when the Mind\\n', 'cannot so bring its Ideas together, as by their immediate Comparison, and as it were Juxta-\\n', 'position, or application one to another, to perceive their Agreement or Disagreement, it is fain,\\n', 'by the Intervention of other Ideas (one or more, as it happens) to discover the Agreement or\\n', 'Disagreement, which it searches; and this is that which we call Reasoning.\\n', '\\n', '(IV.ii.2)\\n', 'Locke seems to be saying that the intervening idea needed to show the agreement is\\n', 'brought into contemporaneity with the ideas already in the mind, which allows for\\n', 'the perception of agreement between the previously juxtaposed ideas. This would be\\n', 'the sense in which the original ideas overlap with the new intervening idea in\\n', '42 Owen (1999: 47).\\n', '\\n', '43 Mackie (1976: 180–1) considers and rejects this (owing to the lack of a metaphysical underpinning) as a possible revision of Locke’s theory. “Locke could have said that what makes me the same person from one moment to the next, while I’m awake, is a genuine co-consciousness of experiences, an overlapping of specious presents. What I take to be happening now is not instantaneous, not confined within a knife-edge present, but fills some short stretch of time, and these nows overlap one another. For each now there is, we might say, an I-occurrence, and successive I-occurrences will similarly overlap and fade into one another: thus these I-occurrences build up into a continuous I-history. The single person, the I, is what is taken to be there, all at once, at each moment in an I-history. This constitutes my identity throughout any one waking day, any period throughout which I am continuously conscious.” Periods of unconsciousness are filled by what Mackie calls “memory bridges.” Mackie ultimately rejects the revision because he thinks that Locke rejects it. I would argue that because Mackie is reading Locke as having an appropriation theory of sorts, he misreads Locke’s claims concerning “distinct incommunicable consciousnesses” in II.xxvii.20 as meaning different collections of conscious states or memories, rather than a point about the relation between a single man and two metaphysically distinct consciousnesses, which would give rise to two phenomenologically distinct experiences of one’s own thinking.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'something like an extended or continuing present. In being conscious of my indi-\\n', 'vidual successive perceptions of ideas as an uninterrupted continuous stream of\\n', 'thinking, which seems to happen in reasoning, I am conscious of myself as something\\n', 'that continues to exist, as having a temporally extended existence.44\\n', 'As was mentioned briefly in the last chapter, we see the same sort of thing happening\\n', 'in reflection, in particular on a past thought, as the perceptual situation in which\\n', 'consciousness is “extended backwards” in the appropriation of a past action. When\\n', 'I currently reflect on a perception of a past thought or action, I have in my mind\\n', 'simultaneously two different perceptions of ideas. I have the present reflection and\\n', 'I have the revived idea that is the object of the reflection. Internal to both perceptions is\\n', 'the consciousness of myself, in the one case as reflecting and in the other case as\\n', 'remembering. If there is the same internal experience of myself—the same first-personal\\n', 'character—as both reflecting and remembering, then there is a unified experience of\\n', 'myself as perceiving from the past to the present, which can be expressed by saying I am\\n', 'conscious of myself as perceiving an idea I had before.45 Thus, I have a unified experience\\n', 'of being conscious of two perceptions of ideas as opposed to an experience that would be\\n', 'described (implausibly) as including two perceptions of ideas with two consciousnesses.\\n', '\\n', 'Moreover, when I have this kind of unified experience of myself as thinking in both the\\n', 'past and the present, I have the experience of my consciousness as “reaching” or\\n', '“extending” into the past. Similar arguments can be given for cases of reflection that\\n', 'do not involve memories. Remember also that Locke defines a person as a “thinking\\n', 'intelligent Being, that has reason and reflection” (II.xxvii.9). Moreover, as we have just\\n', 'seen, reflection is one way—most explicitly when we reflect on memory—in which the\\n', 'continued existence of a person is made present to herself. Because of reflection, I can be\\n', 'conscious of myself, or my person, as something that exists diachronically.46\\n', '44 The problem of establishing how objects of consciousness can have a temporal existence comes front and center in later attempts to give descriptive analyses of the nature of conscious experience. Zahavi (2005: 56) describes the problem as Husserl undertook it in this way: “In his Vorlesungen zur Phänome-nologie des inneren Zeitbewusstseins, Husserl asks how it is possible for us to be conscious of temporal objects. His well-known thesis is that a perception of a temporal object, as well as the perception of succession and change, would be impossible if consciousness provided us only with access to the pure now-phase of the object and if the stream of consciousness itself was a series of unconnected points of experiencing, like a line of pearls. Had our perception been restricted to being conscious of that which exists right now, it would have been impossible to perceive anything with temporal extension and duration, for a succession of isolated, punctual, conscious states does not, as such, enable us to experience succession and duration. Since we are obviously conscious of succession and duration, we must acknowledge that our consciousness, one way or another, can encompass more than that which is given right now. Although we can be co-conscious of that which has just been, and that which is about to occur, the crucial question remains: how can we be conscious of that which is no longer, or not yet, present to our consciousness?\\n', '\\n', 'Some have suggested that imagination or memory might play a crucial role. There is however an obvious difference between seeing a movement (that necessarily extends in time) or hearing a melody, and\\n', 'remembering or imagining either. Husserl’s own alternative is to insist on the width of presence.”\\n', '45 See, again, chapter three, part II, section II.4, and chapter four, section 4.2 for Locke’s account of memory and particularly the phenomenology of memory.\\n', '\\n', '46 Note that Locke’s claim that a person must have reflection is yet another piece of evidence that he thinks consciousness is something that continues to exist through momentary conscious states of itself as thinking.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Again, reconstructing Locke’s view in this way bears remarkable similarity to more\\n', 'recent work in the phenomenology of consciousness. Here is Zahavi’s (2011: 329)\\n', 'description of how the “first-personal character” of successive perceptions of ideas\\n', 'allows for the experience of the unity of consciousness:\\n', 'The self doesn’t actively unite disparate bits of experience, nor is the self an extra element that must be added to the stream of consciousness in order to ensure its unification. The point is\\n', 'rather that all experiences that share the same primary presence or first-personal character are\\n', 'mine. To put it differently, experiential (diachronic and synchronic) unity is constituted by\\n', 'first personal character.\\n', '\\n', 'The self does not actively unify thinking; rather, that all thinking has internal to it the\\n', 'same first-personal character ensures that we experience the same self as thinking in\\n', 'a continuous stream.47\\n', 'Alternatively, consider what Locke thinks happens when there is no sameness of\\n', 'first-personal character, namely when consciousnesses are experienced as unrelated:\\n', 'For it is evident in the instance I gave just now, if the consciousness went along with the little\\n', 'Finger, when it was cut off, that would be the same self which was concerned for the whole\\n', 'Body Yesterday, as making a part of it self, whose Actions then it cannot but admit as it own\\n', 'now.

Subsequently, a different “peculiar” consciousness inhabits\\n', 'the body. On my interpretation, consciousness provides the first-personal character of\\n', 'thinking. So when it is in the finger, I would experience myself as being concerned\\n', 'about the finger, but I would not experience myself as concerned about the body.\\n', '\\n', '47 Note that Zahavi is explaining how we have a pre-reflective experience of the unity of consciousness.\\n', '\\n', 'Consider Zahavi’s (2005: 132) explanation of the experience of ourselves in remembering: “To determine whether a past experience is mine, I do not first need to assure myself of the uninterrupted, temporal continuity between my present recollection and the past experience. If I have first-personal access to the past experience, it is automatically given as my past experience. There is more to episodic memory than the retrieval of information from the past. The subjective experience of remembering involves the conviction that the remembered episode was once experienced by me.” Moreover, like Zahavi’s description, were\\n', 'reflection needed to experience the unity of consciousness, then we would also have other ideas generated, which Locke does not include in his discussion of the unity of consciousness. For example, were I to reflect specifically on a succession of ideas, there would be generated an idea of succession and then of duration:\\n', '“’Tis evident to any one who will but observe what passes in his own Mind, that there is a train of Ideas, which constantly succeed one another in his Understanding, as long as he is awake. Reflection on these appearances of several Ideas one after another in our Minds, is that which furnishes us with an Idea of Succession: And the distance between any parts of that Succession, or between the appearance of any two Ideas in our Minds, is that we call Duration” (II.xiv.3). Thus, the unity of consciousness is achieved by virtue of pre-reflective consciousness constituent of every mental state and not by either an idea of the self or the contiguity of mental states themselves.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', 'Similarly, were each perception of an idea to have its own “peculiar consciousness” (as\\n', 'analogous to the example of the finger and the body), there would be no experience of\\n', 'the unity of thinking, no experience of the same self, the same I, in different percep-\\n', 'tions of ideas, say, the same my self that celebrated her twenty-first birthday or just\\n', 'wrote the previous sentence. And importantly for Locke, were there no sense that past\\n', 'selves are identical to me and so their actions belong to me, there would be no attitude\\n', 'of concern (in the non-technical sense) for what I have done or that I might be\\n', 'punished for it. I would have no reason to care that what I have done turns out well for\\n', 'me instead of badly. Without such an experience of the unity of consciousness, our\\n', 'past actions would be of no more concern to us than if they had been done by someone\\n', 'else. Because we are conscious of our past actions as ours, we can be held accountable\\n', 'for the rewards and punishments (pleasures and pains) they bring.48 Likewise,\\n', 'I suggest, we must be able to identify with a future self in order to generate any\\n', 'concern (in the technical sense) about the pleasures and pains promised by a future\\n', 'action. Were I not to experience a future action as mine, I would have no concern that\\n', 'the pleasure it promises leads to true happiness, and so no motivation to suspend my\\n', 'will in order to use reason to figure it out. Therefore, unity of consciousness (both\\n', 'backward- and forward-looking) is necessary to Locke’s account of persons as moral\\n', 'beings—beings that can bear responsibility for what they did in the past and exercise\\n', 'moral agency with respect to what they want to do in the future.49\\n', 'Previous passages focused only on the unity of consciousness from past to present.\\n', '\\n', 'Consider now this passage in which Locke states that we are conscious of ourselves as\\n', 'extending not only into the past, but also into the future:\\n', 'For it is by the consciousness it has of its present Thoughts and Actions, that it is a self to it self now, and so will be the same self as far as the same consciousness can extend to Actions past or\\n', 'to come.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxvii.10)\\n', 'In contemplating a future action, one yet “to come,” I experience my present self as\\n', 'projected into the future—as the same self performing a future action and reaping the\\n', 'consequences.\\n', '\\n', '48 See, again, the passage from II.xxvii.26 cited numerous times.\\n', '\\n', '49 Consciousness is just one of several conditions necessary for moral agency. As we have seen, another is the ability to suspend desire. See LoLordo (2012) for a strong argument that also necessary is the capacity for abstract thought. My agreement with LoLordo that we must have these capacities should not be seen as including agreement with her analysis of each capacity. For example, we disagree somewhat about how to interpret consciousness and also how to interpret the nature of persons. I am not entirely sure, but I suspect we also disagree about the role of consciousness in moral motivation. LoLordo states that Locke’s account of moral agency requires that we have an idea of a future self, which I take to be a concept of a future self.\\n', '\\n', 'But she explains neither how we get that idea nor the mechanics of how it helps to secure motivation. I am arguing that, and I will give an explanation how, pre-reflective unity of consciousness (like experiencing a past self) does the work necessary for Locke’s understanding of how we experience a future self necessary for moral motivation. See also Balibar (2013: 61): “And it is undoubtedly through the unity of reflection, memory, responsibility and appropriation, united in a single phenomenology of ‘internal perception’ that Lockean consciousness remains, at least in its formal structure, a moral consciousness.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Such a temporal experience is fundamental not only to presently seeing past\\n', 'actions as my own and so identifying those for which I am responsible, but also to\\n', 'presently seeing future goods as mine and so identifying those I ought to pursue.\\n', '\\n', 'Seeing a future action as presently mine allows me to consider its potential pleasure\\n', '(or pain) insofar as it has anything to do with me—anything to do with my happiness.\\n', '\\n', 'And in considering a future pleasure as mine, I have to ask myself whether it brings\\n', 'real, or true happiness.50\\n', 'All present goods while experienced bring the pleasure they promise. Locke says,\\n', '“Things in their present enjoyment are what they seem; the apparent and real good are,\\n', 'in this case, always the same” (II.xxi.58). Where the difference between an apparent and\\n', 'a true good becomes evident is in the consideration of those absent pleasures or pains\\n', 'that we are not experiencing presently, but will experience in the future:\\n', 'But because not only present Pleasure and Pain, but that also which is apt by its efficacy, or\\n', 'consequences, to bring it upon us at a distance, is a proper Object of our desires, and apt to\\n', 'move a Creature, that has foresight; therefore things also that draw after them Pleasure and\\n', 'Pain, are considered as Good and Evil.\\n', '\\n', '(II.xxi.61)\\n', 'So, beings with “foresight,” those who can look toward the future and experience a\\n', 'future self, can see how much pleasure is to be gained by attaining what they want.\\n', '\\n', 'Now Locke is turning to the importance of unity of consciousness in deliberation. In\\n', 'considering a future pleasure, Locke says, a person “bring[s] it home upon himself, and\\n', 'consider[s] it as present, and there takes its true dimensions” (II.xxi.63).

Key, therefore, to Locke’s “forensic” account of persons,\\n', 'namely human beings considered as moral beings, capable of moral agency and\\n', 'responsibility, is that through consciousness we are related to future actions (and\\n', 'selves) such that it makes sense to say that we can be motivated to do them.

We can consider the pleasure (or pain) to be gained from getting what we desire as well as considering the pleasure (or pain) gained from the consequences of getting what we desire (II.xxi.66).\\n', '\\n', '51 See, again, II.xxi.51 and II.xxi.47.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', '5.6 Animals are Conscious Too\\n', 'I have argued that the fact that we are conscious beings is foundational to the concern\\n', 'for ourselves that we are happy—that we attain the most pleasure possible—in this\\n', 'life and in an afterlife.

What does this argument\\n', 'mean for the moral status of animals? As part of my earlier argument that Yaffe’s\\n', 'solution to the “Where’s the agent problem” is insufficient to account for moral\\n', 'agency, I invoked the difference between non-human animals and persons. Let me\\n', 'say a little more about that now.\\n', '\\n', 'Because Locke thinks that all animals have perception, and all perception is\\n', 'conscious, he is committed to the view that all animals are conscious. Moreover,\\n', 'I have been arguing that Locke thinks that all consciousness is self-consciousness.\\n', '\\n', 'I realize that assigning consciousness and self-consciousness to very low forms of\\n', 'animal life (as Locke does to oysters and cockles) is quite odd. But perhaps we can see\\n', 'it as a matter of degree. Certainly, it is not so odd to think that many animals in some\\n', 'form or other assign their sensations (especially pleasures and pains) to themselves. It\\n', 'might also be that having more neural capacities (collections of neurons and ganglia)\\n', 'affects the nature and degree of consciousness in animals. Certainly these things can\\n', 'affect the nature of mental activity in general and whether or not the animal has more\\n', 'or fewer mental functions and the degree of their sophistication. Similarly, having\\n', 'reflection and various capacities for reason may affect the difference in the nature\\n', 'and degree of self-consciousness in persons and animals. Moreover, in order for\\n', 'many animals to be moved toward pleasures and away from pains, which they\\n', 'obviously are (and in a way that is not merely stimulus response), they, in some\\n', 'sense, must be able to see themselves as achieving those pleasures or pains.52 Thus, it\\n', 'is not at all a stretch to say that some animals are pre-reflectively self-conscious and\\n', 'have unity of consciousness.\\n', '\\n', 'Now for the sticking point: Given that Locke thinks that all animals are conscious,\\n', 'would my interpretation not entail that (especially higher-functioning) animals have\\n', 'the same concern for their own pleasure and pain and so might have the same\\n', 'freedom we do? And if they have the same freedom, are they on the brink of moral\\n', 'agency? No, for they are unable to reflect and reason in the right way, and therefore\\n', 'cannot rationally assess (as Locke would see it) competing goods and compare their\\n', 'actions to laws, which is required for moral agency. True, Locke does consider\\n', 'animals (brutes) to have some form of reason: “For if they [brutes] have any Ideas\\n', '52 I am grateful to the NYC/NJ Early Modern Philosophy Group, including Enrique Chavez Arvizo,\\n', 'Raffaella De Rosa, Alan Gabby, Don Garrett, Jessica Gordon-Roth, Christia Mercer, Paola Nicholas, and Justin Steinberg, for very helpful suggestions about how to think about the capacities of animals.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'at all, and are not bare Machins (as some would have them) we cannot deny them to\\n', 'have some reason” (II.xi.11). But he is clear that whatever that amounts to, it does not\\n', 'extend to reason utilizing general (abstract) ideas. He says, “If it may be doubted,\\n', 'whether Beasts compound and enlarge their Ideas that way, to any degree: This,\\n', 'I think, I may be positive in, That the power of Abstracting is not at all in them; and\\n', 'that the having of general Ideas, is that which puts a perfect distinction betwixt Man\\n', 'and Brutes; and is as Excellency which the Faculties of Brutes do by no means attain\\n', 'to” (II.xi.10). That brutes do not have abstract ideas precludes them from the sort of\\n', 'reasoning necessary for moral agency, for considering the value of competing goods\\n', 'as they do or do not compare to laws requires abstract ideas.\\n', '\\n', 'Animals, therefore, are not “forensic” beings and so do not have the proper\\n', 'motivation (the concern for true happiness) to suspend the will. Remember that\\n', 'the suspension of the will and the making of rationally informed choices is the\\n', 'perfection of an intellectual nature.53 It leads to the kind and degree of happiness\\n', 'suitable to our “frame and constitution” as intelligent agents capable of a law and true\\n', 'happiness and misery, including in an afterlife. Analogously, we might see the\\n', 'perfection of an animal nature as consisting in the capacities that lead to the attaining\\n', 'of whatever kind and degree of happiness is suitable to its frame and constitution—\\n', 'perhaps its physical “preservation and the continuation of its species” (II.xxi.34).\\n', '\\n', 'Although this passage from II.xxi.34 describes God’s having given human beings\\n', 'what they need for physical preservation, for example, the pangs of hunger and thirst,\\n', 'I take it that Locke is talking about human beings insofar as they are physical\\n', 'creatures, and not insofar as they might also be moral agents. Human beings\\n', 'considered in this way have what they need for the kind and degree of happiness\\n', 'suitable for a creature with that nature. Note that I am drawing a distinction between\\n', 'animals and persons instead of between non-human and human animals. Because of\\n', 'Locke’s commitment to nominalism (that the world does not come presorted into\\n', 'kinds) and his skepticism regarding what we can know of the inner constitutions of\\n', 'things, when it comes to the moral status of beings, it is unclear that he would want to\\n', 'draw a line between non-human and human animals, or between different animals,\\n', 'for fear of making a mistake. Indeed, this commitment might also be driving Locke’s\\n', 'reticence to deny perception and consciousness to mollusks.54\\n', 'For purposes of moral agency, the distinction is between animals (human and\\n', 'otherwise) and persons. In II.xxvii.9, Locke defines ‘person’ as “a thinking intelligent\\n', 'Being, that has reason and reflection, and can consider it self as it self, the same\\n', 'thinking thing in different times and places; which it does only by . . . consciousness.”\\n', 'It seems to me that this would include Prince Maurice’s rational parrot (II.xxvii.8), as\\n', 'long as it had reflection too.

Since animals\\n', 'are conscious, for Locke, their mental capacities must be distinguishable from persons\\n', 'by the fact that they do not have the right kind of reason and reflection and so are not\\n', 'capable of laws. So just as we, namely beings with an intellectual nature (moral agents),\\n', 'naturally have what we need to attain our perfection, including our long-term preser-\\n', 'vation in this life and the next, that is, a concern for true happiness resulting in the\\n', 'freedom to act according to what reason recommends, animals have what they need to\\n', 'attain their perfection, including preservation here and now.55 Were it otherwise, I dare\\n', 'say we would all be created miserable.\\n', '\\n', '5.7 Conclusion\\n', 'In this chapter, I have argued that consciousness plays a significant role in Locke’s\\n', 'account of rational and moral agency. That we are conscious beings is fundamental\\n', 'to the natural concern for ourselves that we attain true happiness—long-term\\n', 'happiness in this life and the next. Such concern for our own true happiness is\\n', 'crucial to the perfection of our nature as intellectual beings, for it results in our\\n', 'freedom to act according to what reason recommends. Our natural concern for our\\n', 'own true happiness ensures that our actions flow from our reason, because it moves\\n', 'the will to suspend present desires; it ensures the rational consideration of whether or\\n', 'not the action presently desired contributes to our true happiness. I have also argued\\n', 'that this account of consciousness allows for the unity of consciousness required for\\n', 'both moral responsibility and moral motivation. It provides the experience of a\\n', 'past self, which is necessary for assuming moral responsibility for past actions, and\\n', 'of a future self, which is necessary for generating the kind of motivation proper to\\n', 'moral agency.\\n', '\\n', 'With this account of the way consciousness grounds moral agency, the narrative\\n', 'established at the beginning of this book comes full circle. That narrative began with\\n', 'the recognition that conscience, understood as an inner evaluative (moral) awareness\\n', 'of oneself, is not the only kind of self-awareness we experience. Indeed, it even seems\\n', '(as was clear in Cudworth and is now clear in Locke) that rationally assessing the\\n', 'moral value of our own actions depends on a more fundamental non moral aware-\\n', 'ness of ourselves and of our own thinking. Consciousness, as a non-evaluative form\\n', 'of self-awareness, is fundamental not only to our philosophical psychology but also\\n', '55 Such a view is not inconsistent with the successful training of animals or even what often appears in animals to be a deliberative consideration of whether or not to act on a desire. For those kinds of behaviors need not require reflection or reasoning and forming judgments, but are easily explained by an association of ideas, a capacity Locke can easily grant to animals. Moreover, it is true that animals will stop themselves from achieving something they desire if they perceive a danger or an oncoming pain as the result of it. But, again, this seems to me more a process of a tug one way and then the other as the result of a succession of contrary desires (as the result of an association of ideas) than the kind of suspension of desire that Locke thinks grounds our freedom.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'to our agency and to our experience of ourselves as rational and moral agents\\n', 'concerned about the long-term consequences of our actions. Moreover, for Locke,\\n', 'in order to be moral beings we must first be conscious beings. Having an evaluative\\n', 'experience of ourselves as moral beings (conscience) requires having a non-\\n', 'evaluative experience of ourselves as thinking beings (consciousness).\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Conclusion\\n', 'In light of the fledgling conceptions of consciousness found in some of Locke’s\\n', 'predecessors and contemporaries, this book argues for an interpretation of con-\\n', 'sciousness in Locke which makes sense of the various roles it plays in the Essay. Most\\n', 'importantly, consciousness has a role to play in Locke’s philosophical psychology\\n', 'and in his theories of knowledge, personal identity, and moral agency.\\n', '\\n', 'Once consciousness is seen as a self-referential awareness internal to any act of\\n', 'thinking, the well-known interpretive problem of finding a suitable fit for conscious-\\n', 'ness in Locke’s model of the mind is solved. All thinking can be conscious without\\n', 'inviting a regress, threatening Locke’s empiricism, or conflicting with his commitment\\n', 'to the paucity of reflective abilities in young children. In addition, consciousness\\n', 'understood in this way lends coherence to Locke’s claims that we are always conscious\\n', 'of an I that is perceiving as well as being aware of the different perceptual sources of our\\n', 'ideas.\\n', '\\n', 'Consciousness of an I perceiving internal to any mental act, which lends a first-\\n', 'personal character to all our thinking, entails that perceptions of ideas are complex\\n', 'mental states with constituent elements. At the very least there is an act of perception,\\n', 'an idea perceived, and consciousness. In addition, though, Locke sees every perception\\n', 'of an idea as accompanied by the perception of a simple idea of existence. Thus, every\\n', 'perception of an idea is actually a complex mental state composed of at least two ideas\\n', 'and consciousness. As I have argued, such complexity results in the fact that, for Locke,\\n', 'perceptions of ideas are complex propositional states.\\n', '\\n', 'This explanation of the nature of our mental states opens the door to understand-\\n', 'ing how Locke could define knowledge in general as the perception of an agreement\\n', 'of ideas and yet also claim that some agreements can be known either on the basis\\n', 'of a single act of perception (whereby we know our own existence), or on the basis of\\n', 'the perception of a single idea, (whereby we know that individual idea). And if that\\n', 'single idea is an occurrent idea of sensation, we have knowledge of the existence of\\n', 'the cause of that idea insofar as Locke sees sensitive knowledge as a species of\\n', 'knowledge. Moreover, the analysis of how we know these kinds of particular truths\\n', 'is not unlike how we more standardly know general truths. In the latter case too, we\\n', 'have knowledge as the result of a complex mental state in which the compared or\\n', 'juxtaposed simultaneous ideas agree and are perceived to agree. Therefore, an\\n', 'analysis of the complexity of our mental states and the constituents therein provides\\n', '\\n', 'CONCLUSION\\n', '\\n', 'a coherent account of how we can know all the various types of agreements in Locke’s\\n', 'theory of knowledge.\\n', '\\n', 'What is more, this analysis makes sense of Locke’s division of knowledge into\\n', 'degrees of certainty and his repeated claims that in spite of the fact that all knowledge\\n', 'is the perception of an agreement of ideas, we have sensitive knowledge of the\\n', 'existence of things external to us. Agreements perceived just in virtue of a complex\\n', 'mental state wherein there are agreeing constituents have psychological features that\\n', 'meet Locke’s conditions for certain knowledge. But not all perceived agreements\\n', 'meet other normative conditions that provide a higher degree of certainty. Where\\n', 'intuitive knowledge and demonstrative knowledge meet further normative condi-\\n', 'tions, sensitive knowledge does not. Thus, not only is having knowledge as the result\\n', 'of the complexity of our mental states fully compatible with Locke’s theory of\\n', 'knowledge as stated in the Essay and elsewhere, but also it lends consistency to\\n', 'that theory where it has always seemed somewhat lacking.\\n', '\\n', 'Understanding the dual role of consciousness in Locke’s theory of personal\\n', 'identity enables us to see why Locke would place so much importance on a psycho-\\n', 'logical condition for identity while at the same time holding on to commitments that\\n', 'require a metaphysical condition. Locke uses the term ‘consciousness’ ambiguously\\n', 'to mean both the psychological awareness of myself as thinking and as the meta-\\n', 'physical ongoing self I am aware of in that conscious state. Once we see that Locke’s\\n', 'theory includes a metaphysical criterion, all of the pieces of the theory fall neatly into\\n', 'place. Locke’s theory avoids the problems of transitivity, circularity, and sufficiency\\n', 'for his moral theory and his theological concerns. Furthermore, that consciousness\\n', 'provides a first-personal character to each mental act explains how we can experience\\n', 'the kind of diachronic unity of consciousness so necessary to Locke’s account of\\n', 'moral agency. Experiencing a past self is necessary for us to take responsibility for\\n', 'what we have done, and anticipating a future self is required for us to assess our\\n', 'future actions in terms of their moral value. Finally, that we are conscious of\\n', 'ourselves in every mental act is at the heart of a concern for our own true happiness,\\n', 'which enables us to exercise the kind of freedom necessary for moral agency and the\\n', 'perfection of an intellectual being.
